<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> Sure, it's ok, but I always have let the guy ask me.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Hmmm, I'm a guy suffering from verbal abuse from my wife.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> You will have more friends that you want... ;)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> It's nice, you get to see pictures of who you are talking to!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> I NEED TO KNOW WHAT 2 DO
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> LOVE ME LOVE ME OH DEAR GOD LOVE ME!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> it wouldnt be a word, it would be me singing operah.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> I like my life with the exception of her yelling and cussing.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> I know how that is .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> does he have a fave sports team?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> no why he will just do it over and over some more while you are gone.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> well the best way is to say look this isnt working out im not into this anymore.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> no sista, i don tink so.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Then kiss her;) works every time bro!!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Women mature way faster than men and some men never mature.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> and ever since then i never bought her another gift.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> and if you really want you can attend her classes with her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> you wont until you pick to be wealthy and powerful.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> dont beg for love dont beg for money and dont beg for respect.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> But you will DEFINALTELY know when you are in love!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> JUST DON'T BASE YOUR RELATIONSHIP ON MONEY OR MATERIAL THINGS.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> If someone asked this:How can I get my boyfriend to notice me?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> i can't sign in at the chatroom
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> you just live with a friend,and i call that friend with rights.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> that trying to change yourself...unless you're really screwed up...but the question doesn't really give us much to go on
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> i cant read his mind but sometime we just like to watch.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> go to france and hear for yourself.
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_35> She knew my ex was married.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> Don't care about what people say.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> well good luck whatever you do.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> As long as your not my wife ... it's fine with me ...lol ...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> because you are still in middle school i do not suggest dating someone in high school.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_30> If that doesn't work try someone else.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_25> tell him you are getting fired if he calls one more time
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> then a guy got involoved and changed everything!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> There's just one of me, but I'm willing if the 4 of you are!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> First, they are not BORN that way, no matter what anyone tries to say.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> try a different kind of girl.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> this girl and i cross a few lines here and there.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> If you really love him then yes.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> dump him as soon as possible its the only thing you  can do dont be stupid and keep him
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> i learned to love myself something i had never done before.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> i go to an all guys school and i have been having trouble meeting girls.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> 3_again don't rush and use words...talk...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> you should be playing with dolls
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Well... Do you talk to that someone much?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> is that considered double dating?even though no level of commitment with the platonic girl fried
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> its not the size of the boob but rather how well one can carry her boobs thats attractive.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> all you got to do is ring her bell !!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> yes, well i guess it depends on the vows.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> maybe you `should be asking where are the stds in Ks.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> meaning that you do not need to make her as your enemy any more.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> then ask her to the next school dance or maybe to see a movie?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Something going on with your friend or hers?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> But, dont get me wrong dont be a doormat and take the submisive route either...find some middle ground!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Might not work too well if you're a real wuss though and end up more scared than she is.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> I guess that depends on if her and her husband are swingers...
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> she wants fun thats y she has affair with u.  dont get serious with her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> just say that you just want to be friends for now.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> Because they're just doing their job!
<NbChars_250> <LevSim_30> get out now while you can
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> yes if they are sexually addicted to it, but then i would say go to a sex coucenlor.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> personally, i think young guys (over 25) are hot!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> because boys are not mature enough to know what they want are know what they have.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> 5' 135 lbs sounds about perfect to me.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> Oh, Honey, please see a counselor!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> If so, I wouldn't be surprised if he cheats again.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> if went with her abviously he didnt care, its not all her fault.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> If she hasen't bought it up there is no need to talk about it...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> You could try to check there 1st.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> If you want one for you maybe you should try Yahoo Personals, shouldn't you?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> First off you gotta be nice to them and just wait on them.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> don't hide anything frm him.go ahead and talk to him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> The same things that you look for in a guy...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Girls who ask guys out are ten times more successful than girls who don't.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> so simpleman fell in love 1 time with his wife and thats real love what he said
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> Don't retaliate - you shouldn't drop to her level.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> cafes/coffee houses; the mall (last resort) i guess it depends on what kind of girl you're looking for.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> He will like anything u give him, if he really loves u !!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> I'm a prude, so I'm going to say marriage.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_90> I, for one, am not like that.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> JUST LOVE THEM THE WAY THEY ARE.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> i married too many times for love..depends on how much money  we are talking.lol
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> mad props to you dude.. very nicely done.. she'll definitely love it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> His dad, meanwhile, is obsessing over this girl.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> fisrt off, that is not a friend.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Hope You can answer me !
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> my other friends agree with me as well.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> But I say love whoever you love and don't even make race a factor.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Please don't go any further with this guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> Talk about 'the time when we...' or 'that one time when we...'.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> any ideas where i could go to meet them?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> If you really like her go with the group.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> Nine Inch Nails---Closer  the sexiest song on the entire planet
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> whatever they accuse you of they are doing it.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_25> Other than that, just be yourself!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> Do be funny and a little cocky.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_25> Simply tell him  Hey I don't like you like that, just let go.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Just see it like that then forget about him or her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> WOMEN WANT A MAN WHO WILL NEVER CHEAT ON THEM .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> something to look at or play with
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> My Dress was long with a 15 foot train!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> All you have to do is comunicate and be yourself and you will be happy
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> When you started to think that right..........that time it self you...ur self got the answer which is wroung.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> i got hurt pretty bad last time so it is just me.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> call him & talk to him about it.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> u'll almost never find a guy that likes you for you and not because you like him.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> just tell them you love them very much
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> It would have to be someone that I know.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> she dont feel the same bout you...let it go....do you even know?...talk to her
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Now don't let the other person read it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> 2. make sure the bestfriend wouldn't have a problem with it(obviously).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> i heard that it doesn't really matters what matters is if you nkow how to use it
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> GO FOR A GUY THAT U THINK IS HOT, BEAUTY IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> It's not as bad as everyone makes it sound.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> sleep with em, you will like each other better
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> and you prolly shouldnt have a GF
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> yes and no, it matters because of comfortabilty and maybe psychological reasons for men, just guessing there.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Maybe you can relive that, then kick it up a notch.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> Being in love doesn't hurt at all, losing love does though.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> my bbf had many reasons why she didn't like my b/f.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> if i were in your shoes i would buy him something he likes.sweatshirt or something like this.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Get together with your friends and have fun!!!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> yes , b/c there is a reason why you proposed, so she should be worth the re think.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> and if you need help ask him for i think he'd rather help than get yelled at and stuff.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> THE BEST WAY TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS TO JUST SAY IT.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> someone who can take care of us in the long run men are big babies
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> compliment her boobs, girls love that!!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> There for you guys just don't notice that we poop!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> Very untraditional, I don't like the thought... but ofcourse it's okay.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> I ONLY CAN SPEAK FOR MY SELF,I'M A FUN-LOVING GUY.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> think about what you want from a wife
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> So maybe you should try it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> you can find ppl online, or where you live.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> Get it out in the open baby!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> try craigslist.com they have tons of chat rooms for Seattle
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> That is nonthreatining and she maybe shier that you know!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> no, because he is going out with Katie Cassidy  I LOVE JESSE TOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> no , maybe you can buy a nice warm blanket, to keep you warm.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> - good listener  - a good friend won't hurt your feelings.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> if he's a good guy, who cares about his color?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> alternatively, you could just find a new best friend - there are plenty out there.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> I dont konw if it is possible.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> no different between ages if the mind is near to eachother
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> Gimme a hand here girls; plz.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Hope you like my ideas !
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_25> SMS If you still can't contact, 5.
<NbChars_250> <LevSim_35> if u like him ask him out and spend more time with him
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> But trust your inner voice and do what you feel you have to!
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> Show up on her doorstep and be like Listen here bitch!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> husbands JUST CAN get it UP AS FAST AS A YOUNG GOOD LOOKING TEEN> THATS WHY
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> You give me power, you give me reason So will you love me?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> plus its not only the age thing hes white and im blk.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> there's more to love than saying i love you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> that is just my gut feeling.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> You give me power, you give me reason So will you love me?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> plus its not only the age thing hes white and im blk.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> there's more to love than saying i love you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> What do YOU do if *I* love a girl on the internet?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> that is just my gut feeling.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> If she is happy than don't allow jealousy to rear it's ugly little head.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> No, I always end up with lumberjack!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> its becuase they love each other.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> Maybe if you knew how he broke up with his daughters mother.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> Then you go and find another girl, what the heck, there are thousands!!!!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> should i trust this jerk or leave him?
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_10> WHY BUY THE COW IF THE MILK IS FREE!!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> if the pipe game is serious hell yeah but just don't get pregnet!!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> no, your are no a nice person to be with....
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> So it be first time or the 100 time use protection!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> As I said before, finding that special person just happens, you can't plan it!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> If there is one thing girls like, it is a man who spells nice.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Ps- Look at my question, I posted I need help, too.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Mature men could care less if their girlfriends are virgins or not.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> WELL IT COULD BE A TRUST THING MY MOTHER IS LIKE THAT WEN MY STEP DAD GOES AWAY.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> He has a baby.. let him work things out with his woman.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> its ok your just waiting for the right person or u dont trust people that well
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> im kinda stuck in the middle!
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> Because a guy will lie, cheat and steal to get you in bed....thats why
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> He has a baby.. let him work things out with his woman.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> its ok your just waiting for the right person or u dont trust people that well
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> first off... how is it that he didnt have a choice??
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> im kinda stuck in the middle!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Because a guy will lie, cheat and steal to get you in bed....thats why
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> that's if you still care !
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> To me Love is Gotham City
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> my question is that , I am just cutting the girls away from me.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_10> YOU AINT INLOVE YOU JUST NEEDED A FRIEND
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_40> if she says u know i do then forget it
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_45> he was an extrovert and i the introvert.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> you have nothing to loose anyway since by planning this your already going to hell.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> but there is always the right person for you out there
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> u r   in the right place right now.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> I'm a butt man myself, so shake it like a polaroid picture!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> he was an extrovert and i the introvert.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> you have nothing to loose anyway since by planning this your already going to hell.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> but there is always the right person for you out there
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> u r   in the right place right now.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> im crazy but ive gotta leave u
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> and im assuming that you mean Amarican.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> I could be that she/he just want to have something, some fun or...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> (a tear came out of his eye when he said that.)
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> i think that men a more creative and i guess women too.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> Ask him and see what he says.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Ask him if he likes you plain out.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> she dont like nice usual guys and we cant lock her up in the house
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> OH NO, No No it will NOT hurt you in that time.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Keep your eyes open, but love him anyway.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> A heady cocktail that girls find irresistible !
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> (i love your questions btw, give me more to answer, lol)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> does she feel the same way??
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> thats when your underwear gets sucked up by your crack
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> yeah, they can say it back, but those are only words.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> I dont want to date anyone else...Should I just be patient?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> ask him....thats the best way but is there signs?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> I honestly don't believe in chat-up lines - just be yourself.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> listen to the XXX soundtrack #10
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> Why can't he just sit and hear me out.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> If you fail, then ask her again and again and again.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> he has to love it and want it to be worked on.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> Are you looking for bad girls or a nice girls?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Because the destiny of the human been is to ask until death !
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> and it might not be a bad idea to get some counselling.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> he would really like it if you kissed him on his .....
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> Because you don't look that good.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_15> Dump her ,she is probly useing U
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> you will make someone happy - for a whole day.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> You would not like it one bit and probably blow a gasket over it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> If you find something 'nice' or 'pretty' or something upsets you - tell her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> do u hesitate to talk to them?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> You always want what you can't have.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> But I'm still in love with him.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> Loosen her up and then see what happens.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> i looked at girls that i liked funny just to throw them off.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> also balance, what is also sexy getting the rent payed.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> It goes back to caveman days.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> why in the world would jesse want to date you,that is a stupid question
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> Will a wink and some flirting help?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> cut off ties 100% and out of sight, out of mind.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> I met my husband online and he isn't a serial killer, at least not that I know of :)
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> Hangout with the girl for awhile...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> I'm telling you--they are out there!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> TO CHERISH THEM AND LOVE THEM FOREVER.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> honey let me tell you what i know i met my boy friend ted carter and be happy
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> sorry, but i don't think she'll be faithful
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> First of all why was the house a mess anyway?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> If she's not, she won't even think about getting a goodbye kiss.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> Few weeks like about 3 or 4 but sometims it takes u MONTHS
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> and they start screaming that all you do is harp about money, you've got a problem.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> Yes, well it took me sometime but I got over it once I went to the strip club.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Definitely - we just don't make as big of a deal about it as guys.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_55> a marriage proposal or  a ring
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Good Luck  hope things work out for you
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> curious as to the type of guy turns a woman on.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Just give ol' Mom a break and let her have her fun.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> And he cant just pick the women he wants to be with like the large membered men.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> maybe she is not ready for something as big as marriage.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_45> Stay with girls your own age.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> then ask her how her day is going.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> just keep looking, it will happen.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> I dont see what the big deal is.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> and dun have money...you will feel good wit ur self.love dun cost a thing
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> You don't know what a full figure woman is?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> Maybe the sex just sucks, go look one up and ask them.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_90> sounds like domestic violence to me.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> I myself am not gay, i was just wondering what your imput is.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> (I dont want to hurt their feelings) thanks
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> a card that says Merry Christmas P.S.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> he needs to earn ur trust and respect.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> my last choice would be something like full length, thick, long pajamas.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> People become mature at different ages, and some never do.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> dont just get a easyer chick ;)
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> No problem if he likes you too!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Call her later that day and THEN kiss her.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> get the message dont call again!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Who's going to arrest ya for asking a dude out?
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_45> Don't talk about work or boring stuff.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> U GET DEPRESSED AT SOME TIMES U FEEL LIKE U CANT DO NOTHING JUST LET IT GO PAST.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_50> take her out to dinner or something
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> You know the things I mean -observe & learn & apply .
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> But when the getting isn't getting good anymore is it goodbye?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Or are you looking for someone else to make it that way for you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> i don't know, but to me you sound like a desprate LOSER that is in need for some sex!!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> and i wasnt sure if i was.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> yes there is but  you have to go through a couple bad ones first
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> YOU NEVER HAPPEN TO LISTEN TO THEM AT ALL!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_15> AFTER WHICH NOTHING WILL BE MATTER.SO, IT'S BETTER TO ENJOY IT.AFTER ALL U GOT A LIFE TIME CHANCE.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> Good luck With Finding Love if you haven't already!!!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> hang out with girls more often or make some girlfriends.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> but if things can't work then come to a understanding of what u want to do.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> no this should not worrie you his sister is going just relax.have a good time with out him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Pls don't make it a cage.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Sort of like a guy if he were walking a toy poodle vs a huge dog.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> if he is really trying to find one - no.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_20> Keep looking, the right one isn't gonna dump 'ya!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> dont make her feel guilty over her answer either.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> and start talking to her and be ginuinly (can't spell) interested in her.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_35> Getting mad won't solve a thing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> its like rusian ruelette in the end you always lose!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> if so don't damn her for the same thing you would do.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> What is he angry so about?
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_50> Do priests also fuck their altarboys?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> so, dont get too much that spoil ur life
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> if he doesnt feel the same way about u he wont ignore u. it won ruin the friendship.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Hang out with friends eevry chance you get.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> physical disabilities (like someone who uses a wheelchair)
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> like wat is the rule towards that?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> you first have to read my other questions and then youll know how to answer this ok...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> did he get a girl in time??
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> No, People make mistakes no matter if they are in love or not.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> (and then cleaning the house too!)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> if you love children, and you love him... its perfectly fine.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> or maybe he's just not ready to say he loves you back.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> So what if he freaks out...if he does that is.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> We guys do not mind lesbians at all :)

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> 1- wear short outfits only to him.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> perfectly allright many girls hav asked me out
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> if you cant spend time with her and communicate theres no reason to pursue
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> most of the time it do's not mean anything.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> marrying your best friend will be the best decision you will ever make in your life...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> if you are then you like both men and wommen
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> Woman pretty much lose their minds...so sorry fellas but that's just the way it is...

<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> No excuse not to have a job man.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> who would want someone who treats you like shit.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> because some want to get pregnant, some don't

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> So far it has worked out really well :)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> cause woman give alot of explaination for everything and repeat 10000.. times
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> This is just way over the hill!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Those kind of people are such a pain in the ass!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> AM I GONNA LET ONE NIGHT OF SEX RUIN WHAT I HAVE AT HOME.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Mention a thing you like and see if you get a (belated) X-mas gift
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Your hubby gave you a ring.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> Just go straight to the matter and ask her to be your girlfriend.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> only if you want to, but then deep in your mind you can't forget about.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> im sure if your mom found out she would be pretty pissed.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> (there are lots of creepy stalker types out there.)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> actualy you can look her up in the house its your right as a parent.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> ethan hawke:)) beauty is not his best quality...but he sure has that sex-appeal:)))
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> most likely you best friend will be happy to help you
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> amarica being so generaly fat in all.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Congrats for trying and don't give up.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> that could turn ugly if things go south.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> dude if ya gotta ask then she probably don't or your too insecure
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Because when they say something dirty, it sounds so naughty!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> if devil then mabey an angel isnt for you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> But don't listen to the young one!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Also what do guys like during sex?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> it depends on what you like.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> love isn't a thing 2 b ashamed of.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> ok so I really like this guy at school alot..and I have for about 3 years now.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> But don't give her or her family any reasons not to like you.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> Rouse Christina .. don't know what I mean?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_90> the forehead, down to my cheeks, then the lips.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Don't use any pick up lines just talk to them.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> I wanted to do something like this too!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> Did u masturbate in front one other?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Give him one more chance to change (if U r really in Love with him)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> i dont even remember how our friendship started.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> no because that is the begining to what will come.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> I AM A LIBERIAN 20 YEARS OLD HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATE
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> It's only because you know he's having fun and you're not.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Or, they are just plain stupid!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> i would suggest you take it easy if you think she or he still love you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Probably with his family its okay.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> but like I said before if you trust him I wouldn't worry.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> If they don't even bother to talk to you...
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> xbox 360...i'll love you forever (or he'll love u 4eva)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> THEY FEEL SOMETHING,,,that they want to have that kind of things.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Yes romance is great...candles, rose petals, etc.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> WHY NOT WATCH THE COMMET TO DO THAT WONDERFUL THING.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> But she is not happy, coz I work too hard.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> Think of her favorite thing, place, person, etc.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Dumb lil love cards on sticky notes.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> my daughter is 10 and still says its gross so she doesnt like the idea at all.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> by usher     wine by r kelly and thing that is soft r&b that has a good beat
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> Love, because with love there will come romance!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> whack it before u get down to bizness
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> C'mon, dude,the worst thing that could happen is being rejected!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Like a CD from a band he likes.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> They haven't yet figured out that girls are people, not toys.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> He says he *has* to cheat?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> she prolly thinks ur weak now.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> We are pretty good friends and I don't want to ruin it But I really really like him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> and listen to see what she says .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> there is no dabate for me love all the way....
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Tell her all the things you love about her and no matter where your at or what your doing.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> if that doesn't work refer to line # 1
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> They make vibrators, join in on the fun
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> OK NOW, YOU WANT LIKE A TROPHY BOYFRIEND.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> If you want to hang out and are interested in her then go.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_80> always a secluded place to be found
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> If you don't feel safe, you probably aren't.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_95> hope it works out for you!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> it's romantic she will like it
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> behave like u feel comfortable in his hands.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_15> TAKE IT UP WITH THEM OR YOUR BOSS NOT ME!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_70> Sit down and watch it with him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> i am stressing it so bad.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_25> I fear and worship Zen Monkey winsdom
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> NO OF COURSE I'LL NEVER DO THAT JUST AFTER THEY BROKE UP
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> but he made a mistake and lied to me about a lot of stuff.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> just give her a hug and tell her you love her, and take her for a walk.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> I can do more over and over again i'm the lion of sex.... that what i'll say
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Yeah, i'm one of them; what do u want?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> if kinky is normal then sure!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> if you call that person a friend.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> if we dont get that affection then we feel unwanted and unloved by the man we want it from.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> so your inner heart is telling that is it right?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Ladies love confidence ... and the puppy dog eyes may still catch their attention too :)!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Alot of people forget it's not about ME.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Ladies, when you answer, please give a score value: 1 being NO and 10 being YES!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> I think that likely drove her crazy... because she couldn't tell how I felt about her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> well the better question today would be where should you get it from.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> did u made virtual sex with him?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> tell her...if you dont you will always regret it and always wonder what if you had.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I mean Yes when I say Yes, and No when I say No.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Since he begged me to stay and he would do ANYTHING to keep me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> if you live with your parents, SO WHAT?!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> WHEN YOUR WITH HIM DOES HE TELL YOU HOW HE FEELS?HAVE YOU ASKED?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> i hate guys who are all fumbly when they come to ask you out!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> if u want to speak about this with me.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> just tell him you dont want to deal with him anymore, and just stop talking to him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> IF LOOKS IS WHAT YOU WANT THEN YOU ARE GONNA HAVE TO LOOK YOUR BEST AT ALL TIMES.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> If u do it u could be rich.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> you should get her a beautiful neclace she will love that
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Yes there is..just try and look, maybe one day you will find him.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> BELIEVE IT OR NOT CLOSE FRIENDS SEE IT  BUT DON'T WANT TO INTERFEAR.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> WHEN YOU THINK OF INTERACTING WITH THE OTHER PERSON, TREAT THEM THE WAY YOU WANT TO BE TREATED
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> HE WANTS TO MARRY ME AND HAVE BABIES.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> (I LOVE YOU SO MUCH HON)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Don't worry this pain feels really good though.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_55> like to be loved and love
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> being condiderate of her feelings and needs
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Losing love...well just thinking about loosing the love of my life hurts.
<NbChars_295> <LevSim_20> k bye btw, im a chick
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> yah, for a sampling of tech guys, visit the northbound mountain view caltrain stop at about 5:20 one afternoon.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> (By the way, thick does not mean fat.)
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> I have a feeling you don't want a boyfriend but more of a guy in your life.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> so how can i win her back?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Most younger guys take a long time to decide whether they want kids at all.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> we also are on a pretty tight budget!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> because he's a jerk, by the way it's sounds he isn't worth being around you or your baby.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> haha....i hope this isn't a serious question
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Sure it is!I had to ask my husband out several times before he agreeded.married 15yrs and very happy!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Girls are attracted to sensative guys at most cases...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Get busy and join some clubs or sports teams and stay busy!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Are you sure, you're not just infactuated with the girl?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Sounds like 2 or 3 jobs.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> LOVE IS NOTHING BUT IT IS THE ITEREACTION BETWEEN ANY TWO PERSIONS.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> you can meet an honest man in your dream
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> women are not controll freaks....they just like to have things done the way they want if they can.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> If you like a girl to have sex with your ass even thats not gay.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> think about it the look, the accent.i love foreign hotties
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> she prolly didnt think that on purpose its subconsiense survival of the fitest
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> but if hes not either threaten him or help him
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> I just got married and I know I do, sometime 3 or 4 times.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> you can be nice, but be devilish in the bedroom w/ her.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> just give her time and buy chirstmas like ring meaning that your not going any where for a while
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> doesnt go over board and it expresses alot.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> but he is more finacially stable and is heading the right direction in life.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> are you for or against gay marriage?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> Wait until they have a bad time in thier relationship then tell him to give you a chance.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if you are you might want to ask  if they would mind.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> no i dont believe so, this not to say that love isnt great but look at domestic violence situations.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> without love there cannot be romance!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Haven't you ever looked at porn?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> TRY NOT TO ARGUE WITH HIM.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> I know him.Give him a shout!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> do i forgive him or not?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> I need help and I am the first one to admit it!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> plus many other things i don't have room to type.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> I KNOW IT'S HARD TO EVEN ASK.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> or is it all new age hocus pocus?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> not really sure but soon you'll start talking to eachother
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> even sometime they may cost us extra trouble?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Do you remember the words to the commitment you made - til death do you part???
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_20> I'M LOOKING FOR AN EX'S NUMBER.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> if you have to ask that kind of question... then maybe you should.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> Can boys and girls be just friends and never lovers?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> well that depends on how fast you gave it up.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> just stop and think about it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Just simple dumb little things will get you were you wana be !
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> im sure it was not on purpose!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> i have,  i knew a girl that i grue up with in the church   and we dated.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Find THAT man, my dear, and you have a keeper.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Excuse the picture I just thought it would be funny.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> There are lots of girls that I like, but they may not be interested in me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Ummm... it's hard to do this not knowing your wife, but that's my general advice.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Maybe she already had another guy there and it is a bad time to answer.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> If you really love her then definetely
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> i know there is no possible way this guy loves her more than me.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Has she had a 'bad break up'.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> thats a wonderful gift especially for xmas.you go girl
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> A 6 course dinner (something fun, appetizer at one place, drinks somewhere else, dessert at home, etc.)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> There's too much drama with this one!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> pretend to be straight and that will turn her off and it will all go back to normal
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> When you get married the two become one!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> get over it and go outside and find a real one
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> ask her out go for walks or sumthin plus u need to state her age in ur question
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> now you also make him perform some sort of roll play as a gay man during sex.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Dont wait for them to come up and talk to you!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> IF YOU CAN PROVIDE A GOOD HOME AND A GOOD LIFE THAT'S GREAT.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> Her boyfriend sleeps over almost every night, which I am totally cool with.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> sure go back if you are stupid
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> dont make the mistake bout getting a pretend bf, hell think your unavailable.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> THEN WE ARE DREAMING ABOUT SEX.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> then you and your husband still have tons of time to plays :)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> What does there mom think about this.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> I don't find her sexually attractive now.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> you'd better believe i'd mention it!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> love you don't cheat on, affection you care about but still want to see who else is out there
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_15> no 50%sure nsa sau yan kng ipu2tok mo sa loob
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> ask your best friend to try to seduce him, and see what happens.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> Not Ok to marry your brother's wife, unless she is a widow!
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_10> BEING ROMANTIC BUT DNT EXAGERATE GIVE HER SOME SPACE 2
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_45> Same reason men cheat on wives.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> It sounds like you like her very much.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> i've been into one nasty 'heart break-up' scene.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> but it really depends on how old you are...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> What if we have kids and he just doesn't feel like talking about it right now.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you need to go to counseling.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> Just be there for him and listen.....
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> GOOD LUCK YOUR GONNA NEED IT!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> I Had a girl friend that love to have sex.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> And a lot of men watch pornos and see men with huge members and think its the norm.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> Men are easy and love younger women.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> sure, as long as they keep it just friends
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> So the short answer is, no, they don't have to.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> more than a handful is too much
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> and a few months ago he told me i had his heart!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> But we only worry about in the future am i _going to get_ too big?
<NbChars_275> <LevSim_10> IN THE RAIN LIKE IN THE NOTEBOOK!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> Maybe not just cookies, but I do wish I could stay home and cook!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> Her child (ren) should come first not the guy!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> u should try makeout him:)than u can see if he loves
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> I'm just saying that I wouldn't go back if I were you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> if he doesnt, then hes not worth it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> And don't answer with all the PC garbage.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> But don't think these guys can ever replace you in her heart...they can't!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> it wont be easy to forgive him if ever.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> but the problem is that you dont know if the person youre feeling it for truly love you back.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Ask him/her what do u really feel bout me a friend or more then a friend....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> with somone that she says she loves.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i asked him after work in the parking lot, the rest is history.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> hes my bestest friend, and hes getting me like really fancy thing, but we're not going out or anything.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> just the way my GF looks now.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> if you live far apart all i can suggest is that you take it nice and slow.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> someone who could rock the boat.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> yes a girl can have a baby wethier it's her first time or her 10th
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> A good one is Undernet, another is Dalnet!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> majority of the time, thats all they want.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> Boobs aren't number one on my list though.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> You can't have sex with all the girls you like.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> beacuse girls are more proper and accually care about their grades and beauty,ulike them,the bummish boobs!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Nice guys finish last and get used and dumped for no reason.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Any guy that asks that first, isn't worth it anyway.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> it hurts, it feel like if someone is throwing ice water at your face
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> just think about it, and give yourself time.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> its been 5 years since my last relationship.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> but yea im the one you answered about why are guyz mean?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> you have someone to do the things you enjoy in life with
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> go ahead and join him... enjoy!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> Now he needs to find a real woman with talent!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_15> IT GOES BACK TO ANCIENT TIME OF SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> have you tried paying for it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> you have to ask for a picture first and perhaps talk on the phone.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> boys i like never approach me and i dont like the ones who do.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> but she also says she still loves me.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_10> SOMETIMES AFTER TELLING A MAN HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THEM THEY TEND TO KEEP A DISTANCE FROM YOU.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> simply becoz mens r mad and hungry too!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> And don't think about it too much.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> I dont tink u shd be ving sex
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> consider this for later on in life.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> make her a candle..... but you would have to buy the stuff to make it
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> she should be providing for you in other ways.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> what is sexy, a woman that can take control...in and out of bed.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> a hand made card for her with lots of love
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> to me, there is nothing more sexy than legs!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> i like skiiny ones than curved girls
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Not to be a sicko or anything, but thats what most people do the night/day of/after they get married!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> if shes into it...then just bring it up and bring the guy or girl over.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> SOMEONE WHO WILL LOVE THEM FOR WHO THEY ARE, NOT CRITISIZE THEIR LOOKS OR ANYTHING ELSE.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Respect her space - don't trash her to her friends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> its the way of the world.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> how do i keep my new boy friend happy
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> To tell you I think a bride's dress should be long!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> do u mean being a straight and gay at the same time?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> If she likes it and it dosen't bother you....don't judge her....just make her happy and pull away!!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> IF YOUR MARRIED HE SHOULD PAY THEM TOO.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Their are a lot of ways!...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> he likes me but he wont tell me
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> honestly - i think you will fall and you are doomed to be in love with them.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Life is to short to waste on some one that doesn't want you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> if that doesnt work stop worrying about it, its just your genetics.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> I cannot get her off my mind, I Neeeed her right now Soooo bad!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> It depends on your mood ;)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> there are precisely as many good men out there as there are good women...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Then you should not be friends at all.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Don't let your girlfriends influence you so much either..Hope all goes well.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> this means no communicaton if you can help it no email not phone calls no letters nothing.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> I am sorry but you have to do what your father and mother says!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> I think you just have to wait for more from him.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> MOST PEOPLE WILL WONDER WHY IT TOOK SO LONG TO.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> honestly it isnt right for a guy to always pay im female and i never make a guy pay
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> I THINK THAT IF YOUR THINKING ABOUT IT YOU WONT FEEL IT..
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> If I wanted a woman shaped like a 12 year old boy thats what Id go after.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> You dont have to like this woman but you do have to be civil because of your daughter...Good Luck!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> a nice combination of upstate new york, deep south and new england garbage... hell yeah!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> They're all out to get you!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> But you should be careful no matter where you meet someone.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> you can atempt romance but if there is not love than it won't be romantic
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> i have had some situations like this before.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> (CAUSE I THINK THAT THIS GUY IS REALLY COOL AND FUN)??
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> No she doesnt think i am just not that into her.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Maybe because u are under the age of 18.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Hope you have a Happy New Year!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> My two kids, ages 5 and 3!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> if shes not into it, u shudnt force her or minipulate her into doin it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> we don't have much of a social life outside of my family because my husband hates dealing with people.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> You have to get out there and look.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_5> LIKE PARIS HILTION WOULD SAY THAT'S HOT!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_20> something that you will have to do
<NbChars_35> <LevSim_20> Not saying you are...just the ones I've had experience with.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> You have to get out there and look.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> LIKE PARIS HILTION WOULD SAY THAT'S HOT!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> something that you will have to do
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> or find a nice lesbian who wants a kid and work that angle?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Not saying you are...just the ones I've had experience with.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> just tell her straight it's over.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> if he cheats, you wouldnt even know it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> they dont want to lose you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> I can't get this girl out of my mind!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Why not ask her out for coffee?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> i have a daughter so i don't want to break my marriage.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> WORK FROM HOME.. Id Agree to that..
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> love girl to whom parents say no.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> she's telling and showing how much she likes me, but im just not sure what she's thinking.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Stop dating people who don't like you.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> then it becomes do you love him?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> dude that was a stupid question.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> did you try wacking him upside the head after he was quiet too long.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Just tell yourself, you got nothing to worry about.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_40> :-) (Ps...I am not a GAY!
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_35> its 50 50 we give you give.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> a hot nice funny one duhh
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> but then one day your heart will let you know it was the best thing you ever did.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> see my pic, it is at goa, do u think i look smart.?.........
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Just hard to make them see it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> If he's not there then it will not work.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> im sure there are, some guys dont have much of a sex drive, for various reasons.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> And remember, smart girls like smart guys.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> I guess you'd have to ask him
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> If he's not there then it will not work.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> plz your english is disgusting, before you think about making out, go fix your stupid grammer.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> im sure there are, some guys dont have much of a sex drive, for various reasons.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> And remember, smart girls like smart guys.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Everytime I bring myself to do it, I can't and I feel bad about it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> but don't ignore or close the door on u 2. i hope i helped.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> you get over the 1st as soon as you meet the 2nd
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> well....my family just goes to the public library or town hall....ask people at the public library where to go.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> That's like taking her to a movie.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> well, if it's not a banana in his pocket ...
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_10> I SEE WHAT U MEAN, U WANNA GET NOTICED WITHOUT GOING ALL OUT!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> And if you still not know what to give him...die!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> as often as they feel like
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> you guys can talk about anything.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> trust your gut instincts that is why we have them.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> For some reason they just tend to come out really pretty (I don't know why).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> my experience....they just want to get laid....
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> actually, its like this- i m 21. but not a single boyfriend till date.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> that says alot, baby all he wants is to cumm in you get u pregnant and leave u alone...ok
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> No, I am searching for one too...r u interested?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> if he did it once he would do it again, sorry
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> # Do I feel different than other guys?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> no dont, just let him catch you in bed with me.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> if u can treat the cause of depresion.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> maybe he just didnt hear you, say it again.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> u should stay he wnats to be better for you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Same to you and your family and friends... ;)
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> It sounds like she's not interested in working things out.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> And it gives them a complex (I mean it would with most humans).
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> maybe he just didnt hear you, say it again.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_35> u should stay he wnats to be better for you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> It sounds like she's not interested in working things out.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> If you don't then you can't get.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_40> i agree with shayisall4christ- to say it another way: it's never really equal, never!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Is it possible that the Indiana Lottery will be televised again soon...stay tuned :)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> GOOD LUCK AND GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR CHILD IN THE FUTURE...
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> ok, my best friend and my boy friend are fighting over me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> I cant say hell loud enough... but HELLLLLLLL NO!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> it might have just slipped out of his mind.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> once you get this in chat you can get anything from them
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> do you like to be spank?..thats a weird question
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> IT MAYB TRUST ISSUES AND THE FACT HE IS WITH HIS BUDDIES AND NOT YOU
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> i agree with both answers above me
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> so i say if your happy doing it on side go for it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> THERE WILL BE YOUR WAKE UP CALL NO MATTER WHAT.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> SOMETIMES IT JUST TAKES A SITUATION THATS BRINGS YOU AROUND OR ANOTHER PERSON.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> (unless you're boozed to the hilt.. lol
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If that is holding you back, just shun your worries and ask the lucky guy out!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> just look for x-rated things when you're doing searches.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> if so, get him something with that team on it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Us girls are just not as likley to talk about it as guys are.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_5> ANYWAYS YOU GOTTA BE FLEXIBLE IN THE BEGINING THEN TAKE CONTROL!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> I mean, what should I do?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> i had a bestfriend that was bisexual.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Sometimes during argument we say and do things that we don't mean.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> it shouldnt matter where u are.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> this is the nature of women and men .... this is briefly
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> No matter what happens, there's gonna be some fallout.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> 3 years after, they came back and we were still best of friend.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> thats better than any  gift you could give her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> most probably in the bedroom............on the bed.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> wich of corse makes it that much harder.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Don't let him get all sexist on you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> someone who is honest and creative.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> I DONT CARE WHAT YOUR COWORKER SAID ABOUT YOUR FRIEND BEHIND YOUR BACK!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Just call if you want to call.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> But for others, I say if both people in the relationship are happy, so be it!
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_20> I dunno.. that's a tough question.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_30> You should get a more mature girl friend , who will share.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> I like You and wait if they accept ur love or not that all
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> there are more out there like you then you think
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> I couldnt even some close to keeping up with her.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> what do you mean by fun??
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> As long as she didnt to it while u guys we still 2gether.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> sorry its no such thing i wish it was
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> You don't really need a man, I say.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> I WOULD PREFER BEYONCE BUT I WOULD NOT WANT TO GO OFF JUST LOOKS
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> After 4 years he should be ready to say it back!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> but if you just try to work things out, your only lost of time spent.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> over-react when you ask him questions with suspicion.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> I want people to feel comfortable here, but ohhh you pretty grrrs!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> i dont like to quit or to funny guys!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> it shows you have backbone and arent afraid.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> i dont know; i honestly dont understand it at all.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> I know it's not easy, but just forget it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> if they are nice and they tell you to stop writing then then STOP!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> DO THEY MANIPULATE OR CONTROL YOU?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> If you are a nice person then read on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> r u a boy or gurl?????
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> you shouldnt be talking to him because he probably only wants one thing from you-sex.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> (It was so sexy, I couldn't believe it.)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Andy anyway you are way to young to date!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> Last i had sex with my wife was 2 mths ago.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> If he refuses to give me oral sex
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> but i really care about him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> do u not like his kids?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Do you try to make it exciting?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> flower or rose it.. that way it'll make it THAT much more special)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> my heart goes out to you!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> when the fun is gone the love follows.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Or you can do the little move most girls do.... dropping hints and subtly flirting.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> Think, how much do you know about her?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Second of all.. why do women fight with other women about a man??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> (Comes down to what they look like on the inside!)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> Well sweetheart, where should i begin?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Stop slacking and get to work man.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> You can't find it ~ it finds you!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Enjoy it to the fullest its what ever floats your boat
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Time only knows Time only knows...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> when u have to ask that ?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> yeah, like the other people said.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Other than that it really depends upon the girl... good luck!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Whenever u meet new girl  :))
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> oh and most guys love it when you initiate the sex get loud and talk dirty.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> NO STRAT TO TALK TO HIM AND LET HIM ASK YOU!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> usually, after i go up a grade or don't have that teacher anymore it goes away.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> then again, your s/o could just be overprotective.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> What to do?, you cyber grrrs won't give me a chance.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> Can't speak for anyone else, but I like big everything.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> don't do it, it's only because ur girl is too shy to be alone with u!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> Other than that, he's a good husband!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> 1. he starts not sying yes to dates 2. and lastly he wont like kissing you
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> And he still didn't take it.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> give him a ferrari... and an ipod
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> Men and women a like cheat I don't really know why.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Grandma always said: Why buy the cow ?,  when you can get the milk for free
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> She probably gets stuff like that all the time!
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_50> let him go it was'nt meant to be .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> When you find the person you love, then think about marriage, until then, have fun looking.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> You just really need to move closer to me  :-)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> Grow two things tween yer legs and ask her out!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> 2) This one sucks, but it is possible.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> If I buy him something expensive or really nice he's dissapointed.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> how many women go back to those guys when they think they love them.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> But I think about this person CONSTANTLY.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> My husband does and it doesn't bother me.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Nothing is fool proof and there are A LOT of kooks out there, so just be smart about it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> If she is hot... go for it... but its still kinda wierd
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> the ring like you said is not the issue.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> like your heart is on a frying pan...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> i have a friend since we were in our diaper years.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> and if that is your question.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> Oh, and keep the hell away from my daughter.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> i havent found one yet !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> honey you need to go after an older guy because most men your age prefer the young ladies.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> i know what you mean it like a stab in the heart  HIT ME UP ON MY EMAIL
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> I dont know but it drives me nuts!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Take it from me (I have been happily married for a couple years) WAIT!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> You may be geeky or lame or stupid but someone out there likes that in a person-TRUST ME!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> He is no good because if he flirts with you while he had a girlfriend.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> I can I talk to her about that.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> i think she probably wanted to keep it a secret.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> I don't mind other spots though.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> I HAVE A FRIEND WHOS GOING THROUGH SOMETHING SIMILAR.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> I want her to be happy, but it seems like we just don't mesh right now
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> You will find that one, but dont look!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> listen, why not look into gay couples adoption?
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_40> oh well, >shrug<    im an ass-man anyway   ;-)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> I LOOK AT IT THIS WAY.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> but good luck most guys are just jerks.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> If you don't like it, just don't do it anymore.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I just got out of a 2 year relationship, most of my friends are guys.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> well u should try to make things work with her.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> Why on earth would they care?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> start banging other guy's wives and that should give you some insight
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Cook him breakfast,  play with his toys, and don't talk so much...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I am like that, but it doesn't mean that I don't take my comittment serious.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Yet i do still love the guy.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> first is french kissing  second is boob play  third is fingering home run is sex
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> !and dont forget the red bow around your waist...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Be who you are and don't look back.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Send him a card, actually writing what and why?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> your really love with haert & soul is the best gift
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> I really think he likes But I'm not really sure.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> i am not happy with my husband so if i have affair with somebody does it amount to infidility?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> The best any of us can do is to simply hang in there and keep on trying!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> they may sound nasty or dumb, even if they look good.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> #2 Why would you want a boy to notice you that you didn't like?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> Gay men do that Normal men don't.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> And take advantage that is summer now here...  Brukuthus from south brazil
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> But remember, past is past !
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> you got another chik yet or you still a loser without since her?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> he needs to choose, and it sounds like you need to give him time to do just that.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> the classic it's not u it's me
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> Catch things that he says about ya'lls relationship that ya'll had.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> besides, if he'll do it to her, he'll do it to you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> friendship is very important and you wouldn't wanna ruin' that between ya two.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> How do you know and do we only get one shot?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> What if you consider the future too much?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> maybe cause your used to him being with you and you miss him
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> If she lies, then its free for all.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> decide if he's being honest or not.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> whoa, whoa, its not just wives that lie and break promises.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> I never learned how to do this.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> Forget the he said she said.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> MOVE ON...many more options out there
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> and when she cheat she promised to never cheat again
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> I used to get the shot and it made me a CRAZY person!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> If they aren't it's probably a bad idea and your just causing drama...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Do not pick up the tab.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> THEY WANT A LIFE PARTNER-SOMEONE TO SPEND THE REST OF THEIR LIVES WITH.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> I mean did he saw you naked?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> 10 hours by car or plane...??
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> (But all the other kids are doing it) 3.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Hardest is telling her face to face.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> obviously if either one of them minds, you shouldnt do it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Don't be the one running after her
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> it is wrong to break your promise.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> u look good, but come in a close-up buddy
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> you are too young and he is too old to be talking or having an intrest in you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> just tell him you love him then pinch his nose.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Probably the same, needles hurt...... Getting stuck with a tack, rusty nail?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> Hi I'm from Mi also :-) anyways... You can try going to yahoo people search and try there.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> honey i'm a little busy now we will talk when i get home.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i don't know if she are humble or not
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> i think u should talk to her and see whatsup.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> and i dont think its safe.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_30> Sounds like you're a rebound girl.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> I cannot seem to understand this...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> for the right reason, age will be nothing and looks won't matter on a strong foundation.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> If she gets mad, then she might not be such a good friend after all.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> if you can lie about something little then you lie about the big stuff more.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> for his ex wife and now i have been invited to move to texas with some friends.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> My boyfriends name or just yes:)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> If she is a sweetheart then she doesn't have to be as hot.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> I recommend to be yourself pick up lines just don't work anymiore!
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_35> Sometime you should be smart than be right
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Nope i dont see anything wrong with that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> WELL IF YOU BELIEVE IN GOD PRAY THAT HE WOULD SEND YOU THE RIGHT PERSON
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> No, women do not enjoy sex more than men.
<NbChars_275> <LevSim_20> Just when you think you know someone...BAM!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> Easy, if you suspect that your partner's cheating, they probably are!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> anyone ever make something special for their wife that made her smile.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> i'm really want to find the happenies at anywhere with anyone ..
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> make him a nice romantic dinner
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> if u have to ask then i dont think your ready to marry this guy.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_25> DON'T get drunk and call your ex!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> hell  no  do  yourself  or  find another untill  ya  get  back  togather
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> IT'S NOT ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN BUY HER OR WHAT SHE CAN BUY YOU.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> SO yes it really means something.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Try this one, you&me, sixeight_sixtyeight@yahoo,com am good boy ;-)
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> ask the 14 year old, she should know.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> Go to the movies (NO sequels to movies you saw with your ex!).
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> he just won't have all that baggage!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Bad girls are easy and nice girls are difficult to get.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> step up bro tell her how you feel man!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> Just come out and say it, don't drag it on.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> if you truly loved him you wouldn't have cheated in the first place.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> what to call your loved one besides honey
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> I give my trust to her and think that she/he is loyal to.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> i am trying to do a little detective work for my sister.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I'm planning my wedding right now, and it has helped me a lot!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> and beafor you know it your so ugly you just settle for who ever treats you nice.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> i say it dependes on is the person havin sex
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> Should you marry your brother's wifes young sister?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> I BARELY HAVE TIME FOR MYSELF HOW CAN I GIVE HIM THE TIME HE NEEDS
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> First you need to calm down.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> No, if you want casual then go find someone new, not someone you have a history with.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> because u dont get to give blow jobs
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> if the strong independent women will kick it with me then the stronger the better
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> a gal or a guy falling in love after they started courting.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> If not, it is time to move on with your life.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> most straight guys don't know that for sure, and that's without the temptation of penis!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> Date around and don't worry about getting to deep with anyone.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> send her over tonight and the docter will tell you tomorrow morning.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Take whatever chance you get to have sex.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> he's ready to go by then.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Just ask her...and try adding something like maybe a movie or a home cooked meal...lol
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Because i stay up thinking about her.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> i'm just not attracted to white girls, nothing wrong with that.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> I go to turn over and yank ouch.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> I know I'm not and I'm 23).
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I wouldn't date a girl with breats bigger than my own.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> I don't know what to do.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> I FEEL THAT LOSING A LOVE IS VERY HURTING.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> love is picking up dirty underwear, day after day.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> (but I'm a guy so I might be biased) :)
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> And if Im not back in a relationship, there's someone there that I spend time with.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> No go have fun and don’t give it another thought!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> A huge fight ensued because she was slamming things around and I had asked her to stop.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> try alphabet songs it would make your child genius after your mate giving birth... lol
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Havent you ever made a mistake?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> cus the kids are sleep and they have nothing better to do...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> everyone else is taken...and you won't fool them for long if you aren't in the long run....
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> (Although if it's too big, it's just uncomfortable!!!)
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> I'm leaving on a jet plane, don't
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> if something is bothering you now, it will likely always bother you
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> referring to men, but what about a woman's size, does that matter?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> he went to his x's house to be with his kids last night and he hasnt come back.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> you'd rather get back with each other first
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> But besides that it was fun and all.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> Sounds to me like you don't even deserve a twosome,
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT HIM AND HAVE YOU TOLD HIM?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> You'll be rolling with girls with those 3 pick up lines.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Go with the one you like BETTER.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> ask one of her friends whats up
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> 1: Kiss, 2: Making out(hand), 3:Oral sex(mouth), Homerun: Sex
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> this's life , and we must exept all it's rules .
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> GO UP AND TALK TO THEM!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Damned perverts out there all over the place anymore!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> She wasnt fat when I found her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> the taxi's waiting he's blowing his horn
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> well, i've had  a little trouble with this too.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> just tell him u are tired of the relationship and want to see other people
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> now if she's 25 and you're 40 that's a different story.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> if he think's you're a wimp, whoop some ass and see what happens.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> and u can aslo ask him about his feeling for u.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> men r afraid of strong and independant women cuz they think we'll take more control of them, i guess.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> that would love me, and.. just be happy with me!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> most of the time shy guys like girls to make the first move.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> dont let yourself get hurt anymore.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> I don't think only fool !
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> Well, first off, i told my best friends who i liked.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> and b/c he already has kids tells me he won't just have one woman
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> thats the best way to get a friend
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> He says he didn't have sex with his friend.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> If my man was doing that to me id be fighing with my man.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> dont give up on him though.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> move on and find someone you can trust again, he'll only hurt you again.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Girl, just tell him what you fell and what you think.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> ask these men to if they are married
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> if 2 guys are happy together, or if 2 women are happy together, then let them get married.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> U GOTTA FIGHT FOR THEM, ITS A DOG EAT DOG WORLD, GIRLS DO FIGHT OVER GUYS YOU KNOW.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> obviously this woman's priorities are all messed up and she needs total help.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> because what do you think being with a guy only for money?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> yes, unless they are on the pill or they have not begin their periods
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> No matter how hard you try it has to come from both sides.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> It feels creepy in a over the top religious undertones sorta way...big father is watching!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> And do not let anyone tell you different.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> good luck honey, and merry christmas!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> Geez-whiz... Don't ever marry for money!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> How do I say, Yes, you are so fat that you barely resemble the person I married.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> I've seen women on match.com that say they are looking for men from 6' to 8' tall!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> i'm not sure if you mean o-sex or a-sex.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> aww.... this can melt a womans heart.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> u should do that because u might never have the opportunity to do that again because u may die.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> you guys do things because you want to, not because he's pressuring you to.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> and he will do that if he really loves you.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> If you're not there to stop her then how do you know that her word is true 2 u?
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_25> dont hold back, you snooze you lose..
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> i'm sorry but you'll be happier like this, and
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> i'd talk to her, but she's not the kind of person to listen.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> I have a friend named Tyler that likes me and I dont think I feel the same for him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_5> bY NOT CALLING HER FAT......INSTEAD CALL HER BIG BONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> :)  Edit: I came back and read what Benji wrote!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> i was working abroad, had to quit & come back home since i couldnt stand being away.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> They are just trying to scare you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT I WANT FOR ME.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> She is out for herself and that is so SAD!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> My mother's 2 sisters married 2 brothers.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> text message.... it's all the rage.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> Tell him if he can't hack it, pack it !
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_65> Buy somth and then ask her to go for a beer.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> or even just 'I think I'm lost!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> women that like to have fun!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> Movies, mall...why don't you ask them.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> No this is Free...That is not
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> all my bags are packed, i'm ready to go....
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> Ugly people like you need love :)
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> Just let ur love be mature for some more time...
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> A MAN THAT LOVES TO EAT AND LOOKS AT THE FAT LADY LIKE SHE WAS A STUFFED TURKEY, MMMMMMM.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> it'll appear on her eyes when u r about reaching climax
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> DOES A FAKE DIAMOND MAKE YOUR LOVE OR MARRIAGE ANY LESS REAL?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> i am against gay marriage but i dont have a problem with people being gay.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> when u r lovelorn so listen to a slow music like Yanni in his album  in the mirror
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> Her first initial is A.  OMG What am I gonna do?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> no sorry they were taking while some of us were still sleeping
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> you try 2 b a lil serious
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> Despite that old saying, Money can't buy happiness - it's just not true.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> my guy said he was going to be back at noon it is past noon by almost 3 hrs.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> At least the ones that will admit it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> when he cannot hold it anymore it feels twice as good.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> dont tease her and carry her books
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Skinny girls need to put some meat on their skin!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> To win one you have to get to know her...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> just want to see if i can improve any thing
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> so just feel free and be confident (but not too much, might see you as someone cocky).
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> If that doesn't work, then honestly get a lawyer.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> what you are doing is wrong.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> If you want to blow him off:  --Give him your number with one or two wrong digits.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Don't be that guy... Move on to brighter and better things.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> U can even dicover that u enjoy it easy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> you can't you won't give it away so we have to lie to you to get it.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Meet him at the next party he is going to b at.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> why don't you just be up front with him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> maybe he is still with her
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> even then it may not work out sorry to say.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> this stands true for a lot of white guys.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> If you want to play it cool:  --No.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> its not right, nor wrong to date interracially.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> Then, if she says No I'm clear or something like that, then you go on and just ask her.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> just make sure he loves u back and then face the whole world 2gether
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> tell him that u had an accident then note his reaction
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> and you answered : try naked....IS THAT VULGAR?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> if you want to forgive him or not.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> dont be harsh, because its really hard to take if you do just ignore them, and just be honest
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Just try and get on with your life.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Just start flirting with one of his/her friends.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> (plus, mixed children are the prettiest ;)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> And I am happy to say that I am married to a really nice guy who respects me totlly!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> If their abusive the couldn't care about you that much.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> It just seems hopeless for me
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Dont be afraid of her, and just be yourself  :)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> well if you have to ask...this is a joke right... common what is the punchline
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> It means that he isn't a REAL MAN!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> (grade school, high school, college, jobs, etc.).
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> I'm sure you're a nice guy.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_25> If you really love him, then go for it.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_25> that depends on how far over 30 and how far under 20. too far and you're a pedophile.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> Well you'll never know untill you try eh?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> Never.. being cruel wont make u sexy at all... only barbarians will think u r sexy.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> THATS WHY I SAID YOU SHOULD ALREADT KNOW.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> it hurts but you will like it, when you do have sex lie on a bed
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> if she's a down to Earth type of girl (like me) then sex wouldnt matter.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> That sounds like things i've done before
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> i like thin and funny guys, but thats just me.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> DUH you have kids stay with them!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> and could u anwser my question too?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> what do i do if my mom finds out?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> If you do not believe she is being truthful then dump her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> If no then no you should not ask him out or anyone else for that matter.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> i wanted to marry my bf years ago and we have waited.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> that's a little to romantic but it's good the girl might be a little freaked
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> especially since you dont know her, you don't want to scare her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> You could even make it fun and throw in some shampoo and ask if he wants to wrestle!!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> ...and what can be done to get over it?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> What matters is that u are urself and have fun in ur own group.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> If you hesitate or doubt that you are, then you are not.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> well, he is busy working, studying, cheating on you, etc.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> play the field so to speak.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Sounds like its time to start already
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> he said he was'nt hiding it from me he just did'nt tell me.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> SURROUND YOUR SELF WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE SPECIAL TO YOU.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> dont care about love take revenge
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> Gentlemen, ditto for you and romance.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> i personaly couldnt do it, but i know many who would.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> try eating lunch with her, if that works out for a couple days- you all are actually conversating?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> They want some spice in thier life.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> im a hopeless romantic....stupid at times.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Only talk about you and her and how things are going with the 2 of you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Let them see who you are and don't try to be something you are not.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> if he almost cheated then make him want you back but keep your eye on him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Well it depends do you love him?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> neather dude true lov eis the best
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> You are who you are and dont try to change for ANYBODY!
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_45> Just wondering... Are you a girl?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> if i was the guy i would be hurt
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> All 2 and 4 legged animals are ok, but not insects.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> i would love if a good looking guy would jus kiss me like that without even speaking....emmmmm
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> And thanks for your great B&W digital photos answer!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> Divorce his butt with the quickest!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> a relaitionship isnt based on making out so you should be fine w/ 1 or 2 missed oppertunities
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> sweety, it sounds like this guy is trying to burn the candle at both ends.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> yeah..... movies seem to work ok, but you have to wait a while for everyone else to leave...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> wait till the  old lady read ur question.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> What to do, what to do.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> love always comes with risks, it's a package deal you know.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> we dont need guys to do the job.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> if you have to ask..then i'd say NO
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> anywhere from 8 to 18 but most of us have them during or after the onset of puberty
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Just try to relax, & trust him.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> Many people say, try some others...
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> find his g/f and hurt her break up with him but first slap him
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> You do not bad mouth them!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> Tell her to get a GED and become emancipated and leave if she doest like it.
<NbChars_295> <LevSim_5> LOVE TO MUCH AN HURT TO BAD>
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> Because they only want one thing and their trying to weed out the non-freaks.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> If not, I suggest you leave it alone...
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> So you guys can continue doing the fun stuff together :)) d. Never doubt each other.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> her hubby has been off kilter.need to track down mysterious phone #s and ect...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> But the rest I really  do not want to name.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> i guess that i am surprised that it is even a question.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> The problem isn't really the ring though, it's the lying.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> If she is the legal age then hell yeah!!!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> (Now please don't ask me how I know this!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> or the fact that your hubby loves you?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Most men think it is sexy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> if you love him/her it really doesnt mean that you should be together.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> unless some really weird person asks thm out and they cant say no!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Don’t reject strokes you don’t want.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> then if he still says no then snoop if your not convinced.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> oh honey, you have some work cut out for you.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> And all i lost was everything.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I haven't yet, yet I had friends who had and they liked it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> If you really love your bf, then no.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> i get 1 hour of sleep pre night.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> make her think you got a girlfriend.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> i say if u like them call right away.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> get a diffrent phone number or get a restraining order
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> and just because you are lonely and they fill that gap doesnt mean you are in love.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> no, you are way too young.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Depends On what your looking for in a guy and what you want.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> what do you think about bali?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> But i think not as much as men who want or like it more.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> just tell him to stop calling you at work!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> i dont like skinny or fat guys guys!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> I had to rely on my own resources; at a young age that isn't always good.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Join him...and have fun doing each other thereafter!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Then you know who the really good friends are.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> The USA any flavor you like in any size you like baby
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> THEY WANT A MAN WHO WOULD DIE FOR THEM.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> No dont tell them right away.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_35> see for her interest slowly start asking can we go for the movie since you haven't saw that.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> Don't get mad, it will pass.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> Mother, father, brother, sister, cousin, nephew, niece, aunt, uncle....... We are family........
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> almost every guy in the world likes vidio games no matter how old
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> I am a female and I say, why should a guy have to pay all the time??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> But i am sure that u cant marry ur affair.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> just like straight couples love each other.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> YES IT IS POSSIBLE ONLY IF YOU IN A DREAM
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> and you should if you really do love her!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> if it is true luv, u'll put ur loved one's needs before ur own needs
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> there was one episode where the host (the new guy not tommy grand) got stabbed.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> and the least was 2 week & u?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> they don't what to feel traped
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> Just be you......let nature take its course!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> Read humorous and uplifting books (NO romance novels!).
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> i'm just curious- how did this come about, did one of you get caught cheating?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> But it has to be concensual!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> be your self, flirt, and see what happens next
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> man, kids suck most of the time... if you've got the pleaseure of being an uncle, just enjoy that.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> But this doesn't mean I can't love again.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> make sweet love to them..al of them!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> dont let them get away or you will only end up hurting yourself.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> as often as they can and want to 2 - 5 times a day is a good number
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> btw, of course he can't keep his hands off you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> mr. right is out there somewhere.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Otherwise, you'll always just be wondering...

<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> Girls just like to know that they are sexy and appealing to guys.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> i need to know now before it is too late
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> She never hangs out and he always causes drama when she does.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well usually it depends on what kinda girl were talkin about here.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> He has a baby and she claims that they are married.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_15> SOMEONE WHO WILL BE BY THEIR SIDE NO MATTER WHAT.

<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> just to chat, wtf do you think you should think about that?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> its easy to say but to feel it is amazing.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> she tells him bad things about me thats not true, and now he really don't like me.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> IT WILL BE TOUGH... YOU JUST HAVE TO PULL EVERY THING INSIDE TOGETHER AND BE SOOOOO STRONG.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> # Have I ever had a crush or been in love with a boy or a man?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Theres too many things I hate about him....all he does is play video game, computer and is never romantic!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Try to figure out exactly what it is that has upset you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> Hey, nice guys finish last, remember?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> u are pursuing ur own dreams and he should be able to understand that.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> wht i'll do is ask that person out  and if they say no  just say sike!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> RIBBON IN THE SKY  (STEVIE WONDER)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> I haven't read your other questions (bugger!)
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> i would go with the first response
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> First ask him if he is seeing someone else.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> WELL FROM MY EXPIERENCE IF A GUY IS REALLY INTERESTED,YOU WOULD ALREADY KNOW.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> But seriously, get a photo dude.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> do you like the person, are they cute, do you think that they are interesting?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> best buy or iTunes gift card
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> and i dont like guys who are to short or to tall!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> upon the death of yourself or your child
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> see what she wants and maybe try to rekundle what u guys once had, or remain goos friends.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> It sounds like his the one that broke up with you, Right?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> you can driver her to school and pick her up at the end of the day.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> Forget what's she thinking, make a move.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> You dont need a jerk like that.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> yes , when it comes to an end ; no way to stop it .
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> or, failing that, keep on truckin.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> She may not enjoy a day at the spa, I don't.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> he's horney and your too young... Not to mention it's illegal.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> that's because guys can see better than think
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> etc  You can always try My friends and I were gonna do that (go see that) Saturday, wanna come?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> I want to get married and breed, I cant do that with gays.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> of course i always try to make her happy but not with gifts.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Or the suggestion of a night on the town w/ you!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> If you want to have kids, yes.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> If you like the guy and he feels the same about you, why not?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> someone that i know and trust
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> who minds 1, 3 ,4 and 5. there can be so many nice conbinations of them
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> but doesn't have a straight only policy.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> if you get returns then it will work out.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> If you like the guy and he feels the same about you, why not?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> someone that i know and trust
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> but doesn't have a straight only policy.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> if you get returns then it will work out.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> do u like to wear the same cloths everyday
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> i like pretty much all breasts.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> if u r the other guy (the man in question) what would you expect dear?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Like This is good for one backscratch  What else can I put?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Promise him sex...he probably won't refuse!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Yes... to keep your oth you are suppose to only be with him/her... Period...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> most likely your insticts are right!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> SHE WAS ALWAYS THE STRONGEST PERSON I EVER KNEW, BUT SOMETIMES THERE'S A PERSON WHO CAN REALLY DESTROY YOU.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> your're only in for a false future
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> If it was a total accident then NO I wouldn't  - things happen.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Not so much shopping, but window shopping.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> And it doesn't just jump up and grab you at a later time.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> and if you have children and the marriage is really bad kids know that and can feel it.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> you guys broke up so you can't hold that against her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> If you have to ask, then the answer is NO.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Sometimes it is hard for a girl to see that a guy they are dating isn't nice at first.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> Go out and have some fun (read: get laid).
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> Like they say you can't make anyone like you ,if they don't already.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> he is 20 years old& i 17
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> You are hanging out with the wrong crowd
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> yes i do think there is such a thing as true love some were out there
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> sorry but my wife did the same to me...
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> just like some guys like alot of sex and some don't.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> If you feel comfortable enough to marry, do so; if not, then dont :)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> i hope when i am your age i get lucky like that!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Lifes short so think carefully :) The best of luck 2 you!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i want to know about this.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> If you would like to delete your Yahoo!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> IF HE TRIES TO HOOK UP THEN U WILL KNW
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Its all about what the person wants.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Well.. You can tell her straight out that you like her... Or you can just give hints.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> If she doesnt want you I do =)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> been wondering the sm ething don;t give up thouhg,there are some good men out there.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> Now just use your courage and say it!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> If she keeps doing that its probably b/c she knows it aggravates you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> u can get a web cam and show her your privite parts and say bring it on baby
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> with an negative attitude like that, yup.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Buy her stuff and tell her she is right.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> I would'nt have thought it bad if had not hid it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Really, though, fun dates don't have to be expensive.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> well i heve heard that australia has the most beautiful woman...im not sure
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> know when i'll be back again oh babe
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> cause thats not all a relationship is all about.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> I believe men look at porn and so what.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> And that's the kind of guy you want anyway.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> My wife says they are taken.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> It was something that looked like a kid made but she loved it !
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> You can't affect free will, so... you can't.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> accept the fact that he/she isn't the one for you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> you are probably so unpopular because you are a big fat (A)-hole.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Break up with the person, cry and be sad the time you need and then, be happy again :-)
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Don't let yourself get that way.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> its not just going to be a gift  instead its going to be gifr-for-a-life-time!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_45> I heard a guy explain this best.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> I HAVE DONE EVERY THING THAT THE LAW ALLOWS...ANY IDEAS???
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> u need 2 refer 2 a site 2 know ur frnds email address?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> If he broke up with you, no.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> just don't run to the alter.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> I always cheat on my gf and take girls to walmart!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> gosh, my ex girlgriend had the same 'phobia', i guess, only she wouldnt let me do her either.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> yah he is going by his self!!!!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> drink too much talk too much...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> i think boys fall 4 gurlz who have a preety face, a gr8 body and no brain.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> I dumped ya, but i didnt mean...I was drunk!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> take a good looka t he situation and u can prob tell
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> dont fight it, learn it, and u will be better off.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> your a jerk and your gonna burn in hell.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> Ok my man here is the scoop.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> just remember, after having sex with a guy makes you phisically connected.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> People does this because there ain't nuthin good to did at school.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> i try and give a lot of advice about relationships and here is mine to u .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Oh yeah, but only if they have the right shape of a head.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> actually i believe in both at the same time.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Nipple and ears are good...definitely not tongue.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_35> i really really want her back but idk what to do.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Just don't be surprised if he cheats or dumps you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> She has an awful lot to lose.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> So, ironically, I love people that I hate.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Is lunch in a nice rest.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> Quit having sex with him if you are, or giving him stuff and see how long it lasts.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Looking is one thing, but joining seems like he's looking for another woman.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> NOTHING UNDER THE SUN IS THAT IMPORTANT!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> It'd be great if someone could give me the URL to download the picture
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> It's not that men are dogs.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> time, money, or some of both.

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> ;)  Last part: If you're in love with someone, you'll know.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> Dump him and get on with your life.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> well tell him how much you like him and that you would love to kiss him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Why is she cheating on me???
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> no, my parents are divorced and only my dad dose that
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> and tell them that you aren't interested.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> if you are a very deermined women like myself then yes.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> ;)   Second part: Kiss her below the waist.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> EVER HEARD OF A FRIEND WITH BENEFITS/ BOOTY CALL?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Don't try to force it, though.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> tell her straight out.....get the hell out of my life!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> they are Jerks....Slap him next time
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_35> i read your questions you two have too many issues run boy run
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> it may take a long long long time but go slow and be honest and use lots of love
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Other things that make you happy?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> some people do and some dont
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> or ask him urself he's probably thinking ur lame cause u cant do things ur self.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> if she is a tom boy, take her to a low class diner.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> you also need to keep yourself busy and not think of him like that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Pure & simply bcause they're selfish!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> 12 year olds shouldn't be dating.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> then slow down and start again!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> I found one that is pretty cool.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_10> IF U LOST TRUST IN EACH OTHER THEN U WILL HAVE A VERY HARD TIME COMMUNICATING
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> I don't know what to do.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_10> CALL HER AND TELL HER AND MAYBE IM OR SOMETHING
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> someone that is extremly hard to get.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> ...someone with a good sense of humor...somone who can laugh at themself...
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_50> sign up and track ur friends.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> then it relates to getting laid.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> i do not have a special bond with my father.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> and if you find it hot where do you like them at ?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> 16+ i guess, because the more you wait, the harder it become for the first step
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> You most likely have friends, just not ones you hang out with or do things with outside of work.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> If your brain or heart can't tell, Wee Willy Winky will tellya!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> sometimes things bother me that doesn't bother him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> i don't want him to think i'm a freak, cause i'm not.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> hit him till he stops bothering you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Guys don't like to play these games because we are no good at it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> I HOPE U LIKE MY ANSWER!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> no because if you are only around for the sex where is the relationship?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Men can seperate sex from emotion alot of women can't.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> u shoould be able to read these signs.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> think insecure... they are trying to find out how much you care about their feelings.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> Scratch off lottery tickets, they're cheap and he can win money in the process!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> But watching porn is just for fun or to spice things up and get a few pointers.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Learn to cook, if she can't.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> I think she's still not having sex.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> I dont want to pay $6,000 to someone who does cheezy wedding photos...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> should I give them back or not?-(I broke up with him if you were wandering!)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> God is in you, matter of fact, he(or she) is you!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> finding someone you want to spend your life with would be love.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> how can i find a girlfrind in iran
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> Im hispanic... and I never wanted to scream something out in spanish... just made no damn sense to me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Try talking and you might get that romance once in a while.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> why is it that many people have a hard time being faithful and finding that special someone
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> mabey you shouldnt say it, maybe you should just go 4 it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> real love in the world is sex
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> One man and hes 5 years older than me!!!!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> you can talk and maybe you can salvage your friendship
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> My advice is get out more, turn the internet off, socialise!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> she is short and fine looking.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> how old r u and if i know i will go out with you?????????
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> when you're in love you can think about that person for hours at a time.belive me i know.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> most people just go for easy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> children are made to chose who to love more mom or dad and who they depend on.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> No - he isn't worth it and you are worth more.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_10> IF U DONT HEAR FROM UR BOYFRIEND OR GIRLFRIEND, THEN ITS BASICALLY THE GENERAL RULE THAT ITS OVER!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> I am not attracted to girls that don't shave.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> First part first: Because she's creamy and DOESN'T want you just then.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Do u look good in them?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> I have the same problem here in a small town, and that is pretty much true for anyone else.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> if he likes you back, well, need i say more.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> you just have to follow ur heart and see what hapends.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> There's no should here -- you're upset, it sounds like, and that's that.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> change da roles up n c how u'd feel if he did it 2 u.  blu/kev
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_35> what love words can i call my lover?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> depends on the woman and the man, it is more than a hair or no-hair question.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> And I not arrange marriage is not at all bad.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> used to live in long beach, ca, moved to texas in 1992 1993
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> If u don't know your name, then introduce yourself, tell her where u've seen her, etc.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> you can get hom only in the dreams
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> I am really shy and talking to girls is really hard for me.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_20> You need to dump that fool girl.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> THe worst he can say is no.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> to break up with my boyfriend for somthing he never did
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_40> If  so, give him a chance.
<NbChars_40> <LevSim_20> Im not huge but im bigger than average and ive never had a problem.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> THe worst he can say is no.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> If  so, give him a chance.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> Im not huge but im bigger than average and ive never had a problem.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Tell her you have a crush on her lol
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> Well girl, most of the time you don't!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> Where as some guys are just desprately looking for any girl to love him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Unless you're a super model, nobody want to be your sugar daddy.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> yeah wast jazzy girl said ^^^^^^^ i would fall 4 that
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> I think if your in love leave your husband and wife and be together
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> becuase i so dont believe in marraige!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> We were lucky cuz we could
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> Hope this helps, best of luck.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> And no way in hell would my child go to daycare if I could stay home.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> I dont know much about her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> but it seems to me ur looking for a way out of the relationship
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> no... unless you are stalking them, then it is bad
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> What Say the rest of You?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> Well sounds like from what you said, he is soooooo not over her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Is she someone you wish to spend the rest of your life with?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> dont let it bother you becuase it sounds like she has deep feelings for you.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> i've met a nice italian man who is fairly upfront lol not in a bad way i mean confident.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Those are the hottest things on my man!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> Like my  husband sets  around no matter what time he gets home he just watches tv, sleeps and reads.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> If you mean girls :) well, I think it depends upon the girl.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> MY DAUGHTER IS 26, AND NOT MARRIED,BUT BEAUTIFUL AND SMART.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> Give me your moms number and i'll make it so she's not single anymore.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> I just can't relax and enjoy sex.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> you deserve someone better to that man.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> cuz we are like that oh and learn how to spell (girls)
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> Talk on the phone like I suggested in your other post :}
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Don't    If you guys have a connection, He'll ask you first.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> just show her a good Sexperience.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Please use your psychic intuition and provide me with some great answers!!!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> If you're lucky, wifey won't find out.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_10> BACK HAIR.... CAN YOU SAY YUCKKKKK!!!!!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> I never once thought of leaving him, nor did he want to be without me.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> There are a couple of things at play here.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i don't believe there is a correct age.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> she needs to learn how to be an adult.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_15> YES YES YES YES YES YES YES IT SAYS IT IN THE BIBLE!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> long distance relationships usually don't last, but it is possible
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> nothing wrong with not just doing it to do it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> b'coz i thought thts gud for her and after tht our relationship is low..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> bet the guy to kiss you
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> if there is a break up, it hurts a lot more, because you gave up something special to him.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> And look at him right in the eyes.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> in your case i would say no.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> To me it sound like this guy want wat every guy wants from a chick TandA.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> I guess it wouldn't be so wrong as long as your like 16.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> i mean do really take that much
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> because it cant be a one way street.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> first ask youself if he is the right guy.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> still can she have a crush on me.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> Because she ate all of HIS food man!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> one was 30 the other 20. they were really nice & sweet.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> Yes... either tell him to get serious or get lost.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i am not sure when she will say it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> yes it is it just takes sime time.try it and you will see.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> cause people are stupid and think that all there is between guys and girls is love and sex
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> what will u do with all the data ??
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> Maybe some do, but it is probably some issues they have (like bad childhood, bad love life, etc.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> what is it help me plz??
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> and that they have no business messing with your marriage.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Well I think if you love her than age doesn't matter.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Because girls are more emotional and get alot of their think from early on.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> You can enjoy Him/Her in any way, any where, and any how!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> I work in a Junior High School, I can wait.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> if he won't like you for what you are, dangz it, he's not worth it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> just be a friend to her and sooner things might develop.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> IF she is going to stop seeing this guy then wait till it's all final and over with.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> I am a guy...I would say the first things the girls notice is the wallet!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Once a sl_t always a sl_t.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> meet a female to date for free
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> If you find him....don't let him go!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> I want, I need, I deserve a pretty girl.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> I don't think anything of it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> The Magic 8 Ball says: Ask again later...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> Just keep on loving him, but do it genuinely!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> doesn't matter the key fact is she's your wife!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> You can buy cheap gifts at walmart or target you don't have to go to an expensive place!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Here think of it this way...
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> to watch ur little one, and have some fun together.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Some women are easy to persuade, some aren't.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> If u like a girl and ur allowed to date go for it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> Get legal What a great advice!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> !i really need some backup on this one anyone?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> This irks me... Are girls really nice or are they really mean?
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> my first love was when i was 14!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Not a crazy word, just a crazy world.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Men like asian chicks because they are female.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> we fall in love becuse we are very very happy
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> My guess would be because men are lazy.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> i think holidays could give us a real rest
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> You fight a lot with someone you love.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> when u are in love and know that this is the right person
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> well since it wasnt a real relationship, id move on!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> hot guys that smell good and have a possitive attitude.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> of course its good, if u make it so.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> that he does'nt want to talk about.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> !I mean you'll never know wut will happen if u dont try right?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Im in love and it feels soooo good.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> YOU MADE YOUR OWN DECISIONS AND MISTAKES, NOW, AGREE OR DISAGREE, IT IS THEIR TURN TO DO THE SAME.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> But it doesn't mean they guy will last longer than a minute.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> find something unique to make it special.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> if u guys hook up and it doesnt work out then you'll both  lose a friend.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> but when you actually think you are... you really might not be.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> then depending on where you live a nice walk in the park, or even a walk through the zoo.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Do not try to date just yet.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> i want to know my future i want to know my marriage
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> a 4 letter word that has created havoc for years!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> espcially when you argue over dumb stuff
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> but make sure he feels the same for you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Should I send her a note N CC him?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> Its hard but your gonna have to let go
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> Buy one of those sex dolls instead.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> girls like older men who can hold it down
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> How old u r anyway does anybody agree w/ on this question!
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> if not in your area, then goto another area.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> girls you would say no to if they asked you out.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> That always (and I mean ALWAYS) works.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Like I would like it if you fill in the blank
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Probably he was makin' both of you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> WHEN HE/SHE IS WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THE TIME.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> tha other was a white guy in 6th grade.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> If you didn't love her and only wanted her for fun, that would be one thing.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> Just want to see what other people out there like.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> but talk to him first that is number one!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Hope I didn't confuse you too much.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> but nothing can come out of it cause they are best friends
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> but one has to make it that way.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> listen give him a break maybe hes going through something.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> So how do I start things off?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> ), there have been years of infidelity in one form or another, e.g.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> Well... you should just be your self!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> When she says no, she means no!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> god loves you if you love you.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> Well... Yeah, some women like nerds.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> if you like you could bring them to whatever sports your into.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Wait until you are sick of her.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_15> CHRISTAIN ARE PROPOSE TO GO BY THE NEW ONE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> If you want some diamonds for your birthday, just ask!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> This man would go celibate before ever thinking of screwing a man!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Rip his clothes off when he gets home!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> gal n guys are created to make sure that mankind don't become extint on the earth.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> when you hear their voice u melt.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> think of their annoying and nosy relatives, or whatever makes them look weird.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> It's so sad...we can pick our friends, but we can't pick our family.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Sorry, but I'm just not interested.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> play just sounds so much more fun!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> MOVE ON, THIS SOUNDS LIKE A ONE WAY STREET
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> oh and be ready to pay for the check!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Probably not...I don't want random germs!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Yet, he says he still loves me.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Or I have been lied to and I suck.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> You might even make some money talking about it on Jerry Springer!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Please be waiting for me baby when I come around.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> I hope I had at least saw her once and listened to her last words...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Honestly, you're just gonna have to deal.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> ...He sounds boring...VERY unlike men such as myself...Lol.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> He has liked me for soooooo long
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> My first time wasnt good at all.
<NbChars_310> <LevSim_25> be her friend and the rest will come
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> STICK TO THIS and start seeing other men!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> If he likes sports, buy him a skyblue basketball or something
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Have you tryed Porn, toys, in the park, on the beach,(if available),or, just do like i do.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> but is there any way to look at it?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> JENNA JAMESON all the way she is so hot my bf and I always argue over her
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> because women give men fake relationship so we have to cheat on them
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> but is there any way to look at it?
<NbChars_255> <LevSim_30> Work it out or end it sheesh
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> does he always seperate himself from the family?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> they only like to be tied up with a ring on their finger
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> We start to wonder if this guy likes us or whatever, start looking for signs, start thinking of possibilities...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i am not sure what to do or think.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> Let me know if this helps
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> it would be best if u asked a family member about that
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> If you both like it, Cool.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I met my son's stepfather at work :)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> so no need to worry,it gonna alright as long as you use the right method.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> you ask a married woman if she has a sister.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> are u both willing to take that chance?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> a true friend is someone you can talk to and someone u can trust.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I think you should tell here soon
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> in May a very gud friend of mine proposed 2 me and i said no!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> But you shouldn't trust my opinion, i just like lesbians :) lol
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> sounds like your man is an inconsiderate pig.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> you already have alot of doubt.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> Ha, don't listen to the others who say just date this jealous coward.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> he has a girl that lives far away though.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> you know, thugs, scrubs, mammas boys, women beaters the whole shabam.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> If that doesn't help you can always try the Yahoo!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> How do i win her back?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> wow, sorry to hear about your girl, thats sad.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> I told her and she is thinking about it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> If she does it again, start looking for a replacement...
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> ask his friends or better yet a sister or a brother.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> ur not sposed to make a boy interested.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Well it obviously turns her on, it's normal don't know where you are but keep warm lol.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> if it's casual it's not special .. unless what's special is happening in the environment that's casual ..
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> what you feel when you met the guy/girl of your dremas
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Don't wait for him to make the move!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> go out and have fun, explore and test your limits..... you'll be happy u did!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> chat with me and email me.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> take him somewhere energetic or make it a romatic night at home.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> you should wait until you are married if that is what you want.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> you need to get him checked out.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> this way you will always be having fun while your looking.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> Maybe she is sick or got kidnapped...be creative.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> then talk to him constantly, non stop, about anything, your day, you dog, tv, whats not on tv.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i can tap my feet for hours!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Why do Women cheat on Men?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> She might, but if you rush and ask her, it might not do so well.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> what has she always wanted to do?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> Now, who say age is just a mere number?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> it doesn't have to cost anything.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> check my answer to your previous question
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> it is just a moment where everything is racing in your head.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> then you can face him or away from him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> always go with you first mind.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Once she's gone, she's gone, unless... unless...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> if it looks 'cared for' i wouldnt worry too much
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> But now, it's like a dream come true.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> if he was chrisitan like he should have been (equally yolked?)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> I have learned this lesson the hard way- MIND YOUR BUSINESS!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> OMG I would just enjoy and say nothing.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> I'm not perfect nor will I ever be, but better :)
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> You aren't gonna want sex when you are 70, so what will you have left??
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> all he can do is say no.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> make them laugh..it's an orgasm you can give them anytime, anywhere...and nobody has to sleep in the wet spot..:-)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> i have been very selfless in the relationship and she would be the 1st one to tell u that.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> you cant stand to be apart and you do everything together.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> think of that little thing they do that's SO annoying.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> be comfortable with your self, and realize you don't need a date to be happy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> It's like this, it's practically a brother and sisters job to tease and annoy eachother.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> well maybe u should get back with ur ex instead od using someone else
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i would say if u really like the boy then dont be scared 2 admit it.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> it is a two way street.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> remember, a lot of guys are slobs who just want to have sex with you.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> I stay platonic friends with all my exs because Im just a nice guy.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> NO it will only lead to problems, Trust me I know!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> So when in doubt ask your girl what she wants out of her relationship.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Guys also love talking about themselves.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> I say, ask your wife to give you a pouncing and go from there!!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_10> WELL HONESTLY I THINK WHO EVER THIS PERSON IS,IS SO SELF ABSORBED.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> I know what you mean man.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> there is one out there for you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i dont have a problem with that.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> THEN AFTER YOU HAVE ENOUGH, GET LOVE.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> You have a complex, get over it!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> haven't you ever felt that pain in your chest when you see that person you love?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> even though everyone saw me give him my house key he says i was telling our business.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> be sweet, but don't overdo it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> If the two of you are apart now you should keep it that way.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> otherwise she may think that u only want to fulfill ur desires.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> Besides how old were u when u lost virginity and the tables turn on u now!!(lol)!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> not a really expensive one(unless u got the money), bit a nice one.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Easy to massage and I like that sleek look.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> when that certain person starts acting weird around you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> If your not already friens with them, get that first.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> I think guys want sex, women want security.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> But I could be wrong, this is just what I've heard.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Will this nice girl Amanda say yes if I ask her out on a date?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> do without hun cause otherwise you would be commiting adultry and that is wrong!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> he was just good to me and the kids.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> both man and woman enjoys sex
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> But make sure you get her permission first!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_80> going to the movies were it is quiet
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> and dont talk about porn or masterbating in front of her
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_90> Tell them you do not see them that way.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> he likes the colour skyblue & he likes chains
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> our lip when talking those words
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> a bf that she is about to dump?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> If u don't want the woman you're with just leave her...and her mom too!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> Is she willing to give it up for you?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> and that you want to try to work this out.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> being yourself and not something your not.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> get over it and just f--k her good...  answ3r3r
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> Sounds a bit funny to me.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> I would prefer a girl 20+ years younger....girls my age suck.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> They're hunters, so let him hunt!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Its sounds like your a bit angry!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> as long as the person WANTS to stay on the phone, hell yeah!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> just go, its better being single anyhow.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Once in a while bring her flowers.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> JUST WAIT THE RIGHT PERSON WILL COME IT JUST MIGHT TAKE A WHILE
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> If I felt the need to change something, it's time to move on!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> THEY HAVE MORE CLASS AND ARE  MORE> WHAT SHOULD I SAY?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Now think of this guy... Is he worth that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> i find that periced ears are not because lots of girls have that but other periceing it hot
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> Mmmm, sounds like you would either have to be really stupid, or crazy, or both.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> why didn't you think of all that before you did what you did?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> then i gave it to the lady.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> Your gonna have to hurt thier feelings regardless.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> so that they can make as many babies as possible.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> But here's what I would do...
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> you go with your bf on their meetings.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> So just think about what your getting into before you jump in.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> Duh when summer comes around again go back.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Especially the ones from Eastern Europe !
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> ASIAN WOMAN ARE WOW!GREAT TOO, BUT I ONLY COULD PICK ONE  :0(
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> maby one day your will come along
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> but everyday we hold hands and each other when its cold.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> I think it means they flirt with other people.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_50> how do i get him back?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> She only wants you to make the first move....TALK TO HER !!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> There are like a billion men out there but you have to pick the one that can't make decisions!?!?!?!!??!!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> Is it such a bad thing to be a virgin??
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Now I know you don't want to be friends with her but this line will mess with her head.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> I dont knww whether to go back and forth or up and down or what?!?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> What if you did that and you lost your friend?
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> sorry this doesnt really answer ur question, but i had to respond to it!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_20> chivalry is dead...and women killed it.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> well it depends........... do u really love her?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> yes but it can also be a good thing 2  depends on how it works out
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_10> NEVER THAT IS NOT EVEN RIGTH,THAT IS WHY I PREFER TO HAVE FRIENDS FROM THE OPPOSITE SEX
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Theres, this guy that I see all the time at school.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> say i love u and ur good at sports and ur hott
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> did he bring me breakfast in bed like i did for him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> And I might be boring him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> i don't want to be nasty to her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> If you love that person, you shouldn't wanna share them.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Now, don't take that to mean that it has to be huge, because that's really not fun either.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> and the manly answer is ... both at once!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> IF HE HURTS YOUR FEELING, HE DOSE NOT LIKE YOU
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> Oh wait- maybe that's just 'tired'.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> They are fun and everyone likes them.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> i need somewhere to hold on to
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_25> Why get involved with this type of guy?
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_15> THIS WAY YOU WILL HAVE BOTH.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> Do ur thing and have fun.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> ditch ya gurlfriend go fer morgan sounds nice dont get toooooo inta her c what im sayin
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> Depends on how old you two are.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_20> Any way you cut it, divorce sucks.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> At the homepage highlight SONGS and click FREE DOWNLOADS.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> tell him the two of them might need couseling.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> He is a gentleman, so he will not do anything unless you ask him to.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> This girl definately is interested in you.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_15> ARE YOU SURE HE IS NOT DOING HIM, DON'T BE DUMB!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> But that is only what I think.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> sorry im a decent  heterosexual man
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> Both of you dont really mind if you dont do it.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> Love that's how money starts ..........with love
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> Anyway the point is I am in love with my Lord, and He is in love with me!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> age doesn't matter....you can't help who you like or fall in love with
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> i registred in it and i gave away my email adress, now i regret it...
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> Do what the f%ck u wanna do
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> walk up start talking, and after a few of talking ask, hey, you think we could hang sometime?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Hope that helps and you don't take my advice in jest!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Once you are married you can have all you want!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> he will get it i've were intimate but he won't die, but its still an STd.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> Do what the f%ck u wanna do
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> walk up start talking, and after a few of talking ask, hey, you think we could hang sometime?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> Hope that helps and you don't take my advice in jest!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> Once you are married you can have all you want!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_20> he will get it i've were intimate but he won't die, but its still an STd.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> long hair, girls licking their ice cream cones
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> now technically if he was with her and cheating on her with you...he was cheating on both of you!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> if that isnt unconditional love I dont know what is...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> the eyes are the best part of a woman
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> NO THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THER JUST LIKE YOU.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_20> I met my boyfriend at my school!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> Ask if she likes this or that.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> When you do not have to sneak
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_30> Tell him I want you to kiss me.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> when u know the reality of real love.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> ask him wut his answer is.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Should i hang out with him?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> trogens r supposed to be good
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Not to small, but not too big.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> someone you would die for is love.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> this has happened to me before, it sucks but you know what?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> did you see the movie Trois
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> but statistically it is up to 2-3 times a week and 10 times a month
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> It does not.. Greek gods does have a small ones, believe me!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> getting back willmake him think you changed your mind.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> Although nice guys can whoop your ass too.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_15> BUT LIKE I SAID GOD IS WHAT YOU MAKE OUT OF HIM&#92;OR HER
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> I later found out she had been seeing yet another guy in my apartment building!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> but watever, i guess sense im not in that postition i dont understand.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> I totally agree try and spice thinngs up a little that always works
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> once alot of men hear they have a baby they tend to leave
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> you ever hear that saying No one loves you like you do?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Not to get nasty or anything but have you tried phone sex?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> he will cheat on you just as he cheated on her.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> maybe be friends with the opposite sex.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> In comes Joe Nathan in the 9th......
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> SOUNDS TIGHT, IF YOU FIND OUT LET ME KNOW TOO!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> Hey now the guy on 40 year old virgin wasn't that bad looking lol.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> But waht if I like it and want it to continue?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> Well, it was like reading her diary.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> have sex before and after studying
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Remember, if your spouse found out then it would not be too nice (well, in most cases anyways).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> oh yeah and he's going to me birthday party.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> I have an 18 months old..so i know!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> well didnt have one so no high and no low
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> Be a little mad but dont over do it cause u might lose someone you really care about.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Just my experience :)  Good luck!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> soulmate comes after love which come after friendship
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> dont do it if its not something you want.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_20> Just keep looking for em', she out there.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> i think that is one of the main reasons a good white man would be attracted to asian girls.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> as she stands there with her boyfriend.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_30> - Do you still want to be married to your spouse?
<NbChars_270> <LevSim_20> you have to make sacrifices for those you love
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> after maybe, cuz they tend to be lazy after eating and just wanna lie in bed.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> but i want to be with him.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Her and her boyfriend discussed everything...!!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> well it works for me although i can have it just about anytime of the day, i guess
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> You won't go to hell just for being a lesbian.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> make out when the ball drops!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> I just brok up with my bf... and I just told him straight up.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Just after you have flossed, brushed and garggled...oh, yeah...him too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> do unto others as you'd have them do to you...not do unto others as they do to you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> SHE HAS BEEN WITH GUYS, A COUPLE HEARTACHES, BUT LOVES HERSELF,WHATS THE HURRY HERE.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> only if it was a wrong number
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> If he is super cute you should go out with him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> umm, I don't think that;s gonna happen if you dont' have her 7 digits.but if u do..........DUH call her!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> OH GOD!, why would you ever do that?.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> SO ANYWAYS....so yes what a crush huh...I just think he is sooooooo CHARMING!!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> guys playing basketball with their shirts off and sweat on them running they look so hot.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> But I still love and miss her.. What the hells wrong with me?!?!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> and i mean, its just so much more fun when she feels like a victim afterwards... kisses!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> If ya wanna know more about me go to Cupid.com, find aipoilbo in the 12953 area.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> that would be something you would need to work out with her.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> If you are not ready... don't.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> But, if you sit there and think about it, there is not a single way, here on Y!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> and i can wait to go to school.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> Head games are for kids not adults...K
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> when they act shy around u and when they r really really nice.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> this kind of questions comes up qhen you are in doubt.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> well theres still plenty of years ahead of you, so dont worry!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> personally i wouldnt care either way.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> my motto is say what you mean, mean what you say.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> im 25 male ang good looking with a daughter
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> Should I tell her that and then dump her for her mom?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Next someone will want to marry a tree, o
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Guys to like conversing and they LOVE IT when girls approach them at all.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> It wil lblow her mind that you listened to her.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Real women want the good guy.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> Well theres this guy at my skool that is really hott and i really really like him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Hang out at the SNCO or O'Club.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> See what can go wrong in this picture?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> I wonder what exactly is on the east coast????
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> He is missing out, NOT YOU :)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> So no, soulmates do not exist.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> There must be some things that work and some things that don't.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> lying, other men, things we do or don't owe one another, wll not ease your pain.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> well... because... we are girls !!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Buy Him A Brand New Skyblue Car with Key Chains on it!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> But, it seems like lately we do nothing but fuss and disagree.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> make them look like there atleast ok at it if there better then u ry all u want.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Frankly even gay guys would dumb you in a heart beat!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> also,you KNOW it is wrong to get involved with someone else's husband.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Ask yourself these Questions..Am I happy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> just don't flirt too much and you may end up in bed that same night.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> i'm into a relationship & i want to impress my lady with little or no fault of mine.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> call the summer camp and con your way into getting her info.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> The girl and I never see each other at all now.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> u'll never go if u didn't become a lesbian
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> Guys or girls, what is the highest number and was it always fun times?
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> When you are mature - INTERDEPENDANCE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> But was his love for her love, period?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> *shrug* but love is beautiful if it's the real thing :)
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> he probaly just didn't find her yet
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> listen to bearhead, that'll do the trick.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> so gay that im going to quit talking now.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Ok question.......  Would you have sex right after eating 9,000 doughnuts?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_10> ?...USE PROTECTION REGARDLESS WHAT YOU DECIDE..
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> Looks shouldn't play a part in how much we like someone, but sometime you just can't help it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Of course its easier to run.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> the strong and silent stratigy has always worked 4 me
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> dont blame her blame her mom or dad.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> just be a man and ask her out.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> well dressed girls...and long hair ones..i love em'!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> it sounds like you're in love with this guy.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> --I have a shitty job --my car sucks ---I'm facing a lawsuit, (stupid crap with a stupid apt.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> just tell him why you dont like him and be nice but not prepy about it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> u go to school with these people called peer's get to know them.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> when i got home he was still there sleep.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> I don't mean that you've done anything wrong per se, you are a woman, and can't read his mind.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> It's like a big sign that says I'm easy!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> realistically have 3-5 times per week
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> what i mean is, ask someone out, but don't care about the answer.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Sooner or later he will want to have sex (assuming you haven't?)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> no; not unless you've already tried to be with this soulmate and things didnt work out
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> it dependes on what he likes.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> hello, ms jasmine,  first of all, does anyone know why he is doing that?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> THEY NEED MEDICATION MAKE THEM GO TO THE DOCTOR.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> most bestfriends that tried the relationship thing, arent bf at all anymore.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> ~~Pretty stupid that I asked it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> angelbaby you just can't go around saying this you have to ask seprate
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> during school i have two jobs and 15 credit hours.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> It drives you crazy, so it works.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> MEN TEND TO GET LAZY-- WHEN THAT HAPPENS THE BODY GETS LAZY TOO.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> shouldn't you be concentrating on school & doing your homework?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> your brother is going to be fine.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> give them a chinese burn...works every time
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> I guess I am just a guy and I can't help it that's why.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> But if it is assault, battery, etc.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> But it sure makes it fun!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> how long did they date and what was the nature of their relationship?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> whether they admit it or not girls love guys that are not afraid to show their true feelings!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> thats just fine as long she is 18 and above play on playa
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> Girl, it sounds to me like he only wants the booty.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> yes and no.........but they love it......
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> If there is one out there they are welcome to e-mail me a picture!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> I like to be with you....
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> I always tell my fiancee if its beautiful, then its beautiful...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> anyone with a suggestion please reply to me at earldbjr@yahoo.com
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> love can hurt, but u can learn from loves pain, and maybe the experience will make one stronger.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> If it is just for a night, just enjoy it :p
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> I can't seem to find a heterosexual straight guy anywhere...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> being friends with your ex is actually healthy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> well you would have to email me back @ fossil7998@yahoo.com and we can talk about that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> gee, i dont know ,how long u been datin her?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> probably, but so is everything else humans do on a daily basis.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> ;) just kidding, I personally prefer loose fitting underwear...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Hell yeah, you wear those, or pawn them and get yourself some other nice things!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> And, no..I'm not fat or a loser.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> I'll leave the rest up to you!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> love love is more powerful then money
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> If he doesn't...well, then, you are better off.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> if he really likes you he'll open up.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> i'd say whenever you get married.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> I don't mean a one nighter.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> or get with a prositute, if u a freak go for a porn star.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> They have hand-held video games now that don't cost a lot of money, even $1.00-$5.00 and up.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> but at this age you can't do more to get him and also you are not capable.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> Good Luck in Life and Love!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> what are your intentions with this person?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> and also why gripe about honest men?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> easily, but you should spend lot of time with otherwise you lose it!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> i told him, then we'd do what you have planned of course!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> they dont like it...they love it!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> love is a game no doctor can explain it tickels the and affeces the brain
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> what can i do to make him want me again
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> u dont.....unless u ask....(her out that is)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> ya,  they are everywhere you just have to know where to look.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Not some girl who frets and never tries asking.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> I really adore big girls... but i'm not infactuated by them..
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> very greasy and rude...if you like to get beat on on a regular basis...go ahead and date him
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> I found out the hard way...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Other than that I think it is GREAT!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> just make sure he is the one for you!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> (I'll send you pictures if you don't believe me).
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> well, if you guys are screwing already, get her a love swing, good times
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> I met her a while ago...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Don't listen to her, she's a dyke.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> just tell her forget about him if he beats u up tell him that you will call the cops
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> because nature is boy wit gurl.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Some like it, some love it, and some hate it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> And don't bring it up again.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> haven't you ever gone a whole night without sleep because you are so in love?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> If he didn't hear you ask, then bring it up again.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Some girls like it but I am willing to say that most do not.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> Well hottie do you spend time with your girlfriend?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> I'll mary u grrr, but what if u suck in bed??
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> That is the damn NATURE of a Women !
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> If he says no, then they are yours to keep.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> 6 months later he is still so egotistical.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> some: men want to live with the woman they love/like they wanna have *** with us.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> I wouldn't go near anybody like that, even with a schoolbus between us!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> people need there space why dont u call him at all be fair
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> (oh yeah, I love you and I want to marry you, really)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> I don't think it is wrong.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> Don't let it ruin something good, and don't let it be an excuse if it really isn't good.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> im 12 and i used to have a crush on my social studies teacher who is 27!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Most guys probably think that there si something better out there, but they want you too.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> If it does, then I am cheating way to much.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> the thing is that i did his homie and now i feel bad what do i do?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> If it does, then I am cheating way to much.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_10> CHEESE PEOPLE WOULD SAY THIS PERSON LIKES YOU BUT ITS JUST A BATTLE!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> I am single, rich, hott (very) and women love me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> then when you see she is enjoying your company, ask her out
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> yes love can hurt but then again it may not
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> by the way this flirting is not of the physical kind or the answer is NO!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> (we are best friends or should i say WERE best friends!)
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_5> SPEAK UP AND DON'T ASSUME ANYTHING!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> that's what marraige is all about.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_20> I WISH I CAN CHANGE THAT.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> if u like my addvice e-mail me at, tech_boy001@yahoo.com
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE YOUNG MEN, THEY'LL GET OLD TOO!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> i would like to get her number
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> But I dated a slew of women.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> WALK UP TO ONE AND SAY, KISS ME BIG BOY!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> Just get a girlfriend where you live.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> dont push her but dont act like u dont care.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> everyones i know says i was to young to b in love!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> I'm in love, and for once in my life, I am happy with a man.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> going on dates and disturbing girls
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> i really think you should leave your husband a.s.a.p.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> thats what attracts them to most women.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> 1- make her loves you , deeply .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Suck it up and take it in stride.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> sounds like alot of fun, but the whole both being married thing isnt cool.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> are there bigger issues at hand that he doesnt wantto discuss?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> Give yourself time to get over him.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_30> 1.don't shy 2.walk to her 3.look at her eyes 4.talk to her 5.say i like everything about you.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> Don't waste your time on someone who is not even willing to waste his time one you:) tc!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> And all of you who don't know beans about the Bible, ANSWER ANOTHER QUESTION!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Thanks for the compliment, but I'm not looking for any kind of relationship right now..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> diffrent people mature at diffrent ages and some never do.

<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> than he could feel how u r feeling.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> I don't think I want to.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> basically, if  we do do it we are just messing with you.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> I don't live in Ohio, got family there though.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> of course they both had girlfriends!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> People suck and sh** on others all the time it is human nature.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> You did forget the thong now, come on don't ya think a male thong is sexy?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> ok who r u lookin for where do they live and why r u lookin for them

<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> but about the whole marraige thing!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Hun, I feel for you, I have went through similiar myself, men see things differently than woman do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> But if you don't believe in God, I guess you won't care about this argument.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> cant force somebody to like you.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> my friends toll me its a sin to be gay and i wanna no is it ture
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> afternoon morning night   who cares it is sex
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> get a calling card at talkloop.com.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Because we don't want to give it up and be that weeks flavor!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> I think most girls like a taller guys than they are.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> but yet....if u know..u can aswer and give me a hint!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_20> Maybe let her win once or twice :) Tricky question this, in hindsight.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> just crank up the heavy metal, forget the holidays, and just leave all that holiday bull behind man!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Ive never had an ugly breakup and Ive never gone out with a girl twice.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> I know alot of guys that do.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> No way unless you are shelly on this message board
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> i love my grilfriend veary much
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> I rather us be friends then nothing at all.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Ooooh there's a whole bunch of stuff... 1.Attention whores (EX.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> Girls prefer both tall and short guys...
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> Just don't play too hard to get.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> do what's best for you and what you'r heart trule feels good luck.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> If you barely know here, maybe not.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> the eyes talk, hands talk, all the body shows it when a guy like a girl, and vice versa.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> WHY THEY TAKE WHAT YOU SAY,AND TWIST EVERYTHING AROUND.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> yes we do it on prepose, some women dont need men anymore
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> But my wife wont take out the garbage.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> i dont think i ever was.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> Some places NOT to meet a guy:  AA meetings, court system, marriage counselors office, hospital, etc.
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_35> ive had my best friend since i was 6 and im 16 now.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> we both realized that the break up was a lie and now i am in limbo?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> because no one has been down there before stretching her so thats why
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> in general has 3 time / week about how many time wants... i think 5 days from 7?
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> Nope cause it gives u  a break from everything
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_25> No Way Forget what the haters say.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> You should be more focused on their personality:)
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> stop trying so hard, you'll end up losing him that way.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> if there are sparks he's probably interested.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> one more your age girl, not a 56 YEAR OLD!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Anyone much younger that that wouldn't be ok, generally speaking.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> if he pay like he weighs sell em asap!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I'm actually a really good looking, well educated guy.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> for man 23 to 28 and for female 20 to 28
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> well it says in the bible but shit i don't know that shit is just dirty n nasty
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> if she is not attractive then who knows- once per week/month?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> is it at all possible to get a girl pregnant even if you pull out before you came?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> if your good looking, every guy you ever see wants to get with you, so dont sweat that part.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> I took a lady out and she drank way too much.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> THEN it is the WRONG time.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> If you haven't had a baby and are using protection then play on player.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> I talk to him more at school then my own boyfriend
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> Then just kick that useless wuss out.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> and: what kind of person pays for sex?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> i guess we never know until we ask him?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> yes i have a younger boyfriend and our relationship is fine
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Ok, guys dont lose anything after having sex and gals lose most.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> Now dont be mad, calm down.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> And forget the past- cannot return it back anyway!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> give him beers and let him get drunk.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Now when i see him, all we do is....just stare.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> truth hurts.....thats the way it is
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> how can i meet other 15 year olds
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Hey chopdown101 that site is brutal.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> yes , yes , yes, oh yes.....i think u get the picture!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> believe your mind first , then ur heart and take care not to make ur heart first
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> ask any way you want, but be sooooooooooooo careful with that step.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> say hello my name is & youre name is and go from there.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Depends on the guy, depends on the girl.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> If you are a guy, girls like brave guys.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> if ur the same age use the phone if ur not i would cut him off
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> they r showing that they like u like u not just the boyfriend type where they cheat on u.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Sounds to me like she certainly likes you!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Don't listen to ignorant people, girl.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Or you're the one paying the rent?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Barry White...anything, even just breathing, is sexy.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> but i think u had this thoughts before marriage also..if im not wrong.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you do it with him now you'll regret it later I promise!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> When you find love, you will definentily know it!- I promise!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> YOU KEEP ON THE WAY YOU ARE!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> everyone deserves a second chance!....but not a third!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> Don't hint around about something like that.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> tell him u want to kno wuts going on?and if he still loves you.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> she was a down to earth great person.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> No life can be replaced ever... Not yours, not mine.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> of course not.. unless u want a relationship only based on looks..
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> They don't have mind ... believe me ;)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> if u have to ask u have a problem
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> she is really scared of getting hurt once again.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> do you want a buddy or a girlfriend?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> yeah, i think its about time, just use protection.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Guys wouldn't date girls if they couldn't get any action at all.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> this my dear is totally unfair.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> sometimes we forget that we simply need to ask.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> the breasts, no matter how many times you play with them you never get bored
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> i dont think you can call  being gay a sin but it is nasty and freaky as hell.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> to her and she will love to do this with you because of her feelings for you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> it shouldnt be just about sex.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> seriously, if you have to ask, you are an idiot
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Be honest, and accepting... thats the christian way, huh?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> Do some checking out before you ask him again.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> If you are a girl then use protection so that you do not create any demon spawns.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Love is love have it your way.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> try this... ask very random people out, ones whom you don't really want to go out with.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> short answer, i guess i dont know...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Of course you girls give me your two cents worth too!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> The best thing to do is just be mature and bold about it and tell her.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> he has liked me on and off for a few years now but i never liked him.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> everybody wants to know this but nobody knows really!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> So hang in there man there is a girl looking for the nice guy.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> ask your mom and your blumber
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> i think true love only comes once.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> I like being called pet  But that's just me....:)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> No one uses drugs just for the fun of it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> i dont really think you can help him he's gonna have to make the desion on his own.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> I think tat's are sexy as hell.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> I WOULD PICK-> LATIN WOMAN,HANDS DOWN.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> Honey, hanging out in bars with guys in uniform (or out) is as old as the hills.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> There's some more, but it varies guy to guy...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> I dont know what to say sorry!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> A book or CD that she really wants but dosen't have
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Most of the kids asking about sex are cybercops, but I agree, you shouldn't be taking a chance.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> yes but cheat on him first
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> and it would conqure all if emotions were not involved.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> IF PEOPLE ONLY LISTEN TO THE OLD ONE THAN YOU ARE MORE OF A JEW THAN A CHRISTAN.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> Harder, softer.... every woman is different so you'd have to ask her exactly what she wants you to do.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> Seems to me like MR. X is playing the field.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_30> During sex...are you a top or bottom?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> I am in love (sort of) and need to know
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> its ok to have friends but dont take it no further than that.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> he says i tell our business but people around us already know.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> girrrrrrrrl just as long as its not expired and make sure its a latex condom
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> If you care about the boy then tell him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> You obviously got married for a reason.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> u had a baby and he's not ready to be a daddy!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> ok, who or what are you searching for?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> how to get even with a cheater
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> we haven't been intimate and i'm scared to tell him.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_20> Well, u can start with that.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> UR FEELINGS MAY STILL STAY IN UR HEART BUT THERE IS OTHER GIRLS OUT THERE.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> Have I lost my best life :( ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Especially when his head is shining.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i don't know what to think.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> women want their guy to know what they actually want.. without even saying!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> just be your self, dont try too hard it will happen
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> thats like being with your dad and thats just sick.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> My wife does not know, I don't want her to know.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> Not many men out there like a woman that dresses trashy or slutty.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> A lot of asian girls look like asian boys.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> Another trick is just get a boy toy to hang out with.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> moving his head back and forth like a chicken?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> I was going to ask this one too!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> why is he even having sex w/you if he's gay?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> It is still paid, if you want further info.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> AND ONCE YOUR CHILD IS AN ADULT, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO DICTATE THEIR ACTIONS, NO MATTER WHAT.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> if he dosent ell u, then that obvioysly means no.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> you could try asking a girl out to start.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> try to make her comfortable and assure her that you really love her
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> Plus you said it yourself, you guys are all just really close friends.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> no because your being a iddiot
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> ya just ask her and secretly go out wif dat person
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> Im gone tell you striaght up if he try to fight bang that fool.email me at kijudo40@yahoo.com
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Oh Yes Oh Oh Oh YES YES YES YES YES!!
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_35> if you can't talk about it yet, you're not ready.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> Even if using it with your hand.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> We love you guys and you let us do it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Not even sure what friendster is?
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> Trust GOD and you will know!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> I prefer darker asian gals with lovely eyes
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> home and cook something special for him.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> if you love your bf, you will trust him.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> and its too soon to jump into something with someone else, it wont last long.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Is that some sort of a miniture dog?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> do u even talk to her
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> My friend is real big and she has plently of guys wanting her.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> app $400.00 , and it's a lot more fun.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> its good for me but i prefer morning
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> go to a place where you are all a lone and then just ask her
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> It's too late dude, you're not going to get one.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> I like long haired guys too,  but really?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> listening to what they have to say.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> Lip to lip isn't french kissin....usin tongue is french kissin
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> But you have to mean it.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> wait till you are at least 30... twenties are too much fun.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> no, but if that happened,you just keep on going,no its not fair.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> I don't want to jump to conclusions...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Men like them young and some men like them a bit to young.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> HUNNY, ITS VALLED THE 1 WEEK RULE!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> Ask a guy who doesn't already have a g/f if he wants to go out with you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> find a friend that lives closer to you...sorry
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> so i can move down to l.a. and set up my own business, to become a wedding photograpger!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> I will not ever do it again!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> my husband still doesn't have a job.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Give me the real thing any day.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> what it sounds like is though is she is trying to let you know she is interested in you.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> you date as many as u want until u purse a serious relationship w/ one
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> No your guy friend is not a good person to discuss it with.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> you keep all men happy with that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> there is no reason why you can't date older chicks if girls date older men.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> IF IT A SEX HEADACHE, GET OVER IT ALREADY!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> DO YOU INTEND TO DISOWN ANY GRANDCHILDREN BORN FROM THIS UNION AS WELL?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> dont be shy and ask her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> My advice is to Stop looking...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> i dont know about toledo but if you came acroos a anser for ohio let me know pleas
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> none they're both just not me indians i guess, never seen a persian person before
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> If the both of you are into it why not I think it is great to explore new things
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> chances are if a guy has sex with you now he probably might only want sex.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> try to tell her what it is you don't like about him - thing he says?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Keep your mouth shut and do your job....  What other's do is none of your business!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> If you think they are the same then you have got bigger problems than cooking.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> bc its finds u not u find it
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> you cannot make someone want to have sex with him.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> if the time is right though.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> well where a uniform ha ha ha!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> HOW MANY TIMES AND HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL ASK THIS QUESTION?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> go a looooong time with out fighting.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> proposed in jan fought in march got forgiven in oct. married in nov.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> the sooner you do, the faster you can get on with your life.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> Or ask when it's a good time
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> i mean hes going to be gone for 3-6 years.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> wait until 15 to allow that, then mini golf with an adult escort.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> try base.google.com, if you are seraching for a person
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> U don't need him theres better guys out there that will take care of u and your baby!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> i am a girl and i LOVE boys.especially cute ones
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> be yourself, take him somewhere that u like.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> tu es mui bonita or tu es caliente!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> well its your choice its about time you experience true pleasure
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_35> Not because he wants you to.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> That doesn't necessarily mean that she is enjoying it.If you know what I mean.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Depends who you ask...some might find that hot.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Fly over there and knock door to door.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> yes i think only once in a lifetime if its true then theres no one else.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> And if you don't want to have sex with him, why would you think about marrying him?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Go and speak with his homie.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> why would you not of picked that as your best answer?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> thats so how bad things happen to ppl
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> Now I know what your thinking.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> will you do me the honor of marrying me??
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> So in answer to your question.............yes.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> no tats, no piercings, thick hair but clean cut.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> Also, can you just move out?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Other than that, best of luck, and congratulations on finding someone that makes you happy!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Just tell her how much she has added to your life and then ask her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Dating should be fun and not always trying to work problems out.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> she is bit shy away and introward.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> Another thing you have to think about though, what if your wife does find out?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> 18+ because than your on your own
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> I think u guys need to talk---seriously!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> I am in love with her so much and she is in love with me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> hello this isn't some type of sex site but if u want to know then u r sick!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> give a nice smile and there ya go
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Then u can ask her out on a friendly get together.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> If your looking for love wait on sex, you'll thank me later...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> if it does then i'm cheating waaaaay too much.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> if it doesnt hurt, then its not love at all.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> Do mind not bieng #1 on her list.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> You will have a great shot at it!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> Just take it slow..and don't jam your tongue in the other person's mouth...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> He just doesn't want you with anyone else.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I cant w8 to go back to school to see my best friend and my boyfriend
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> yes it does.its about 2 -21/2 inches in on the top if she laying down on her back!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> if she's attractive then once/day is normal.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> im college trying to get my degree in photograpghy!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> Didn't quite work out cause i lost both of them
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> well i think there is one out there for everyone!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> If by a certain action many would be happy then do it :) hope it helps
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> dude 3 months and snuggs has given her answer already...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> because he's a man - only deals with important things.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> he already cheated with me, he was still with the ex during the first few months of our relationship.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_15> WHEN SOMEONE PLAYS W/ UR ANGUS
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> always remember why you broke up.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> why would she all of the sudden do this?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Well,do you like the boy who really likes you?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> no and the sad truth when you get married it is not unconditional either.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> run like the wind and don't look back
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Pick yourself up, dust yourself off & start all over again.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> The Gods are telling me NO...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> and just like prettyricky say AGE AIN'T NOTHING BUT A #
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> its not worth it, if its meant to be it will be, until then move on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> just sit down and talk to him and if he doesnt wanna talk make him understand
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> If a girl loves me there is nothing that I cannot like about her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> If you are, you just know.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> well your not suppose to say it just do it when u feel its rite.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> it really depends on her past time frame
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> And it sound like he wants to control you girl
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> Later in life once the Bad Boys don't want to settle down women come looking for MR. Nice Guy.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_20> printed, colored, white....it doesnt matter :)
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> My girlfriend is older than me, (only like half a year though) and I have a crush on her!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> Don't beat yourself up about it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> wait till you think your in love then determian that question.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> i think the guy should spend  his money just on his GF so shes probebly not crazy
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> hmmm all goes back to what you want to believe....
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> You just might need to take it slower.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Keep them and don't look back.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> no answer just i want to collect 2 points ;)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> I am not saying that is right.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> My personal favorite right now is Angel Eyes!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> You won't lose it until u die.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> whats good I need a gurl to talk to
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> What do guys do to show that they like a girl
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> i guess that it depends on the girl ur with
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> if u really love her go on and marry her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> or u can have a friend ask her 4 u.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> If you get a good answer,  let me know.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> someone that you want to please is love.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> he says he's tired and depressed cause of work and that makes him not in the mood.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> say bye and don't look back
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> (And that was almost 4 years ago!!!)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> well theres no real good way.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> some ppl are just into really kinky things
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> The first thing I so don't want to forget........his words.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> just tell him how you feel.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> faith honesty beauty femininity  what lies inside
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> this is a trust issue in that you will always wonder if she will cheat on you.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> They always say wat they don't know wont hurt
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> its hard to remember when you're with the next chick
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> i will still be working..no holidays for me :(
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Good friends don't care if you can't call them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> They both always had a crush on one another... but nothing ever came of it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> IF IT IS A REAL HEADACHE TELL HIM AND WHEN YOU FEEL OK, MAKE IT UP TO HIM.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> if you like areal men men come chris_rou2000@yahoo.gr
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> after 2 years if e still cant take you home to mommy then he aint that serious.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Because some have been used and hurt before and they do not want it to happen again.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> YOU WILL HAVE A NICE LIFE, IF YOU MAKE IT THAT WAY.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> Or, he just doesn't find you interesting.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> If u are not happy in a relationship whatever the reason then u should leave.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> i was the first one to ask this question.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Some never, some sometimes & some all the time...it all depends.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> For me short guys are guys who are under or around 5'7''...but Umm.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> pretty gals can make guys extreme excited.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> She did spend all wk with u but told u that she would spend friday with u.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> so somebody backing them like u may help them if they really have a desire.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> SHAME ON YOU IF YOU DO!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> You can't turn it on and off.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> This is driving me crazy, what should I do!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> But, that doesn't mean that is has to be huge.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Don't do it just to make him happy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Is he the one you want to be with for the rest of your life?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> First of all, you shouldn't do it over the phone.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> I'm going to tell it to ya straight.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> in the first i said to you hi my honey.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> If I'm not working and just lifting weights, I bone her every day.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> girls in short shorts and no bra not to sound bad but that is awsome.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Maybe women are just more vocal, like they are in day-to-day life.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> be patient keep things more distant but let her know nicely you are not going anywhere.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> ask this question in december and i'll tell ya.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> But know this, men lie it's like second nature.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> cuz im not exactly mister perfect or even decent but she at least likes me as a friend
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> He's such a good person and is very emabarrassed about his weight (doesn't bother me, just so the 'thing'works!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> he don't like going dancing, being were theres a lot of people around etc...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> He's trying to close this one out!!!!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> just go out with another person.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> is the thing that worth running all life after and die for...
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> don't give up on us baby.
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_25> you gotta get out there and talk to them.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_10> THE ONE WITH THE BIGGER BOOBS.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_20> yes yes and yes.... if ur flexable
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> I found out that if I talked to guy friends of mine.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Well, if your the one who wanted to break up, no.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> many men aren't this way at all.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> If u don't have a hard work afternoon or a date ... so carry on twice and triple
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> the trouble is if i go home i know i'm not going to came back to washington.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_45> do  let him go or hang on?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> men have habits, if he cheated once, he will most likely do it again!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> Now that gay and gay marriage has become law.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> or the way that wood make is SOOOOOOO MUCH EASIER is just asking her if shes interested!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Neither they both smell like curry
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> How old are the 2 of you?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> and if you do have a girlfriend that is cheating on you... its not very hard to see why.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> I agree with ans 1 & 3. just enjoy while u can.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> you can never be to young to be inlove enjoy it
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> guys tend to be not so emotionally excited as females are.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> How old are the 2 of you?
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> and if you do have a girlfriend that is cheating on you... its not very hard to see why.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> I agree with ans 1 & 3. just enjoy while u can.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> you can never be to young to be inlove enjoy it
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> guys tend to be not so emotionally excited as females are.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_10> WHAT IF MEN COULDNT SCREW WOMEN....WOULD THEY RESORT TO MEN??
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> she helped out more seh was not only concerned with her appearance
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_25> If it's okay with her, why not?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> I like men tall, dark and sexy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Maybe you should ask HIM that... (there is not a handbook or manual for relationships)
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_25> Just come out and say it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> go literotica.com  i send my hubby stories from there.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he will not talk to me on the phone.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> well.. i say it directly  n quite frequently!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> When my sister was nine she wanted one soo bad.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> if he will not listen then leave.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> not at all the past is the past and it should stay in the past...........................
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> but you are not for sure it could just be in your HEAD.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> weve had ups and downs but weve always pulled through everything.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> 11 and a virgin at that??!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> NO NEVER U SHOULD NEVER KILL URSELF B/C OF A BOY ALTHOUGH IT HURTS NEVER!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> yes, depending on a person's life experience.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> No God is VERY VERY special!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_45> Where's ur faith, and ur mountain???
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> but a man is always a man.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> He says he allows it cuz it's gonna help his buisness in the long run.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> 2 grrrs, one, overzealous sexually, refuses to comitt & still sees other guys.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> ), but i guess it all depends on what specific reasons and if its against your morals or not.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> I say atleast 3 times a week----
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> You don't want it to fester.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> !but look into your soul and find the right answer!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> is he always living in my dreamland?~~
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> Just curious, cause I've heard arguments on both sides
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> well...first thing I would want to know is if you are a boy or girl?
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_20> 18-25 - have fun, carpe diem.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> i had them sign the setlist.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> are u a database designer ?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> it depends how they were in bed
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> tell him to stop jealous or ur life will be as hell
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> Easy...go to a place filled with hippies
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> should i stop being her friend?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> just try spending more time with your family.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> Get busy without him and watch him come running!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> dont spend your time with a man that doesnt appreciate you!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> u should be mad but don't over do it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> there is a girl for you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> to young...wait 2 more years at least :-)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If I only had one head I would cry.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> can anyone tell me how to flirt?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> If these don't work, give it up, there's some other problem
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> I only like germs from people I know.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> as soon as you see his eyes start to wonder its already too late.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> LOOK JUST DONT TALK TO OTHER BOYS AND HE WONT GET MAD DOUG!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> yep that would be the quickist way to fin out.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> it is just a number as long as u r healthy and happy.

<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> take a coin, relate one side of it to the ex, the other side to the current.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> Time will tell... she may never appear
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> why not go ahead but he might not think of it so you should go ahead and locate him
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> biggest low was when my exgf lied about being pregnant so she could get money out of me.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> roll naked in honey, then get into a cage w/ a starved african honey badger.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Did you ever just love an animal like a cat or dog?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> No worries though, there are so many men out there who would never do that.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> If you love him and give him the best sex in the world!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> well if you ain't in love with them then thay just ain't the right person.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> he will get annoy and you then can tell him to go away.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> I know it's crazy 4 wives in 20 years.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> we are not together at this time
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> 110% - I have experienced this first hand ;)  By the way... Great answer Pregunton!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> love is meant with sincerity and compassion and hate is with deciete and lies
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> UNLESS DEATH WAS NOT NATURAL AND UNDER INVESTIGATION
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> trust me there are nice guys, I'm one of them.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> if he likes sports, then a jersey with his favorite team on it...

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> no one likes to be hurt.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> or did he go out of his way to see if i needed something like i did for him.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> mosty she leaves space for me next to her so that i can sit there but we dont talk.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> When you're a teen-ager maybe, but not after you are in your 20's.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> but we want to feel wanted to
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> No guys ever say that to a girl, so she now thinks your different which is good.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Depends on what are u comparing it too.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> trust your instincts they are usualy right.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> HA HA ... ive heard that joke before
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> i THINK YOU STRONG AND WISE FOR THAT DESICION
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Do you think that I have a chance with him??
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> YOU CAN'T STOP SMILING, THE PHONE RINGS AND YOU JUMP TO ANSWER HOPING IT'S THEM.

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Hope you will find your love soon :)
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> well most women do not need a man.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> second, i know its hard (cause i'm single too) be PATIENT!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> did you see the movie Trois
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> I love a fuzzy chest but please no fuzzy a$$ or backs.Eeww!!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_20> Try asking her if she's trying to tell you something with this.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Most do not, but some do.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Enjoy the fantasy if you want, but forget making it a reality.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> 2 years will not matter unless you are really young
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> no matter which way we answer... we can't win....  CAN WE ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> that person could really like you
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_30> anything, man, that you know she is into!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_50> Lust at first sight...love at first conversation.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Im 25 and there is no way I could ever be a mooch like that!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> So is it possible, hell ya.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> how old are YOU in the first place?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> well try to tell them reply me if you can marvinndlovu@yahoo.com
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> but most of all, don't try to be someone you are not.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> She knows how to make men suffer !
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> Yes cheating is bad and people get hurt but it is not your place to tell.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> S&M = Sadism & Masochism  Definitions:  Sad•ism (sayd'-iz-em)  (1.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> Your friend really cares about the guy.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> there is a website called theclitoris.com.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> stroke you up (i forgot the artist)
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> If it where someone unrelated and whom you didn't care about you probably would'nt even have raised an eyebrow.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> you'd be surprise that sex might not be the only thing that you're having problems with.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Smile and let ur eyes smile too then tell him or her that she is different for u ...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> when he's constanly eyeing u and smiling.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> TOO MANY PEOPLE USE THAT EXCUSE.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_15> WE HAVE BEEN DATING 3 1/2 YRS.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> OK, FIRST YOU GOTTA GET SOME GAME...YOU KNOW HOW IT IS, SWEET TALK OR LIKE AN ADVERTISEMENT OF YOURSELF.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> SHE CAN BE A B--CH  FOR NO REASON.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> she was lucky i didnt press charges.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> would u want ur boyfriend 2 hang wit sum chick that liked him?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> i think  grandfathers always right in these matters
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> sure, i have lady friends that hang out with me.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> Much easier than it is to switch back, I'd imagine!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> all in the family aren't you, aybe you should see what her grand mother has to offer you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i think its changes things for the worse!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> First of all your already asking the wrong question.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> MIGHT AS WELL SAY HE LIVES WITH ME.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> there is a rule that say if u realy like a girl she likes u eather good luck
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_40> whats the worst that could happen.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> crush in an instant desire but in love you are ready to sacrifice everything u have.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> you can't help him unless you help him.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> if you want it go ahead but put your own rules on it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Kind of like trying to take a shower with your clothes on.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> That is a beautiful woman, something about her look does something to me!
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_15> TELL HIM TO LEAVE YOU ALONE, AND TO GO CLUCK HIM SELF.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Should I stay or should I go?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> I wouldn't wait for him, I would dump him and move on.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> loving each other for who they really are, inside and out, caring so bad it hurts.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> first u have to think about the consiquinces.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Um, I dunno,  maybe he likes her PERSONALITY?!?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Once I broke up, it was like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> they are married or have boyfriends.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> I hope this gives you a good start.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> YOU DON'T STOP BEING THEIR PARENT JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T AGREE WITH THEIR DECISIONS.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> If he says he's really  busy  .....He's just not that into you...... Have dignety and move on!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> heck ya its possible, want some help?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> if you had any sense you would find yourself a nice thirty year old guy.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> cuz a lot of men are a$$es and we feel we're better off alone.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> I'm a guy and it kind of gives me the creeps.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> Just take it one day at a time, and see what happens...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> he said he was just thinking of something.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_30> Go get a job, and a car!
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> thats the way it is and will always be, dont know why.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> I miss may family so much most importantly i miss my lil sis.
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_35> do you have food to eat?
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_20> and then again dont be to high !!!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> call your lover..your little ginger snap.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> But I don't remend being friends W/ benefits.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> The problem is that I always end up looking for the wrong girl.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> there isn't a day that i wake up without you being on my mind.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> Anyway she sounds like she meant a lot.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> But, if you're like 30, most people will consider that weird.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> think of this, take him to a resturaunt.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> see if he talks or follow u a lot.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> to try to get someone to like yourself.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> i get you bro im tired of that shit happening
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> but i dont see the point either!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> and how the old man can barely walk but still opens the car door for his wife!?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> differnt ppl determain this in diffrent ways.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_35> always willing to try new things,                                 cheez_it_lord
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> put it this way it dont feel pretty.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> How do you know that u ar in love wity someone,
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> 2-choose the right time { for a female } 3- words are very useful .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> do not ask a guy if he likes you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> men wanna hump every day..unless they are cheating or gay.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> If he doesn't like u, u'll know and can move on.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> she is not your girlfriend anymore.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> your wife has doubts, that given already.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> why would you want to stop missing your boyfriend?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> cuz i dont want my plans to get ruined!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_20> I have to tell ya, demonholloween, you have a tough problem.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_10> IF I ONLY COULD PICK JUST ONE!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> your wife has doubts, that given already.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> why would you want to stop missing your boyfriend?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> cuz i dont want my plans to get ruined!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I have to tell ya, demonholloween, you have a tough problem.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> IF I ONLY COULD PICK JUST ONE!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> BTW -- you guys are my 8-ball right now.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> If u are a christain, then its a sin.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> Next one you get, don't tell every little detail of your life to.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> yes you and your husband should move to texas and become an engineer
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> He will probably be embarassed, but he should get over it if he's a nice guy!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> a persons past isnt a persons future.the fact that she told you shows she is bein honest.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> Lol i think its retarded to have gay marriages.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> Then, think about this...  --I have food to eat.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> And no, it wouldn't kill him - men are supposed to be tough.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> i would just tell the guys that are freaking you out to back off.thats what i do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> boy you are in love just go with your heart and make sure that you dont get it broke
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> i dont remember the first only the last min.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> get the book, you won't regret it!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Maybe you are a good person and you just dont get it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Usually right after you've booted Kitty Puss Puss across the room when you thought she wasn't looking!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> If she was worth it then, she's worth it now!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> when he is comfortable, ask him if he's been seeing anyone else?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> Same answer for a gift for mom: 1.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> you wont have to ask this question
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> your not fat sweetheart your sexy!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_10> SHE'LL FELL MORE SECURE ABOUT BEING WITH YOU AND YOU WONT EXPERIENCE THAT UNPLEASANT SCENE ANYMORE!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> ALL YOU CAN REALLY DO IS LEED BY EXAMPLE, BE HIS POSITIVE FRIEND, AND PRAY.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> it is a dumb way to mess up yours and your frens lives forever.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> What did u get ur self into?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> if he drinks every day than thats to much.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> Okay here is my lil input.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> I WOULD CALL THE POLICE, JUST TO PROTECT THE CHILD.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> 17. i was a skinny dork in school and looked like a boy...no hips, butt, boobs, it was awful.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> i've found that it usually means that they are inexperienced.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> he probaly does if you are attractive and have a good personality
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> if i should leave what would be my first step to become independant of him?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> What if one day they did that s*** to you!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> I don't like too many muscles.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> The smell will turn her so bad she would not care about seeing you ever again.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> They don't think with the right head!!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Why can't i get over this one person?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> my daughter is going out with a grade-lower boy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> its fun and its helps u move on.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> And when his marriage ends so will being nice to U.He's only waitiing for U cuz HE'S MARRIED!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> its the same in both cases but there are some dudes who prefer big women
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> u can never be a better person u can only try to become a better person.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> Well I thought I was in love at 16, then again at 17.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> but earrings wouldnt be to bad a choice as long as they do not have gems.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> If you hit her..even better, just don’t knock her out.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> But some guys are just so good at cheating that you cant tell.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> you say it for as long as you actually love her.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> 3 weeks i told her that i was falling for her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> get your devorse because you don't love your husband any more.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Most certainly...the hardest part is keeping things going long distance...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> IT'S UNDESCRIBABLE BUT YOU WILL KNOW WHEN THE TIME COMES.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> how can u tell if he is the love of your life?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> did you make actual plans or did you just ask him to come over.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> it's the thought that counts, really, it is.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> like i said they are all jerks and assholes
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> if anyone abuses you in any way.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> no - it won't matter anyway ;-)  if it is what you both want then go for it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> i am a christian so i want a christian respones.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> well i found out they were seeing each other for almost a year.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> been going out for 5 years...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> by being pretending a resposible / busy / gentle man.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> i reckon if you do, you do
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> i gave u some addresses where u can meet gays without paying.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> that should tell you she is honest and adventurous
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> Woah, that was an easy question :)
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> I'm 17 and still haven't had a date yet :(
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> When ever you both are in the mood for some lovin'
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> It's only wrong if you say APRIL FOOL afterwards.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> If you don't see each other!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> I BETTER ANSWER THE LAST QUESTIONS!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> but a could meet this fat girl that would die for you .
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> all i want is to make out and tell them to ask me out!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> Let me say this as calmly as I can.....ABSOLUTELY!!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> DO NOT EVER EVEN THINK ABOUT getting physically abusive just because you are angry.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> lol try it... or do sumthing huge!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> i read this book called Mama Gena's Guide...it is your answer!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> guys are alot more likely to cheat on women, than women cheating on men.. but women do it also..
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Good luck ask your lawyer !
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> i mean seriously would you get mad if your bf/gf went to the movies with his/her friends.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> I guess it depends why its broken...some things you just dont get over easily.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> Even if you just had their first child?
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_35> Me 7&da other guy were in luv also cuz he was my 1st and my 1st luv!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> serve me is the idea i see.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> If U only saw him once,hes NOT your boyfriend.Therefore he aint cheating.Dont waste your time.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> Guys/ Girls love to talk also.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> and he has to put me before video games.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> I am going after my partner not the person they were with.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Did he ask you to marry him?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> And yes it works the other way around.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> too much detail than asked for.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> be balanced ,control ur heart with ur mind then ur in the process of becomming better person
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> Sleep in my bed and see what happens :-)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> do u want to speand the rest of your life with me?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> a good friend that will listen will help more than u can imagine
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> cook and clean for him :)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> Well, first I am going to put this out there.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> you might meet this beauitful woman and she could be the biggest b@tch there is.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> it's easy for me but for her it's too big deal
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> you have to be strong and move on!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> I didn't even gotten married during Christmas season.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_40> But Merry Christmas to you too!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> the morning after a nightlong beer drinking taste testing contest
<NbChars_470> <LevSim_20> if so why and if not why?
<NbChars_325> <LevSim_20> But easy may not be a good thing!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> nope and nope and definately nope.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> jus showin up would be a suprise for her and she would be very happy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> you would not like to do it always right.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> I hope you find good news....
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> Know your own mind first & then consider what actions you want to take...my best advice...  Good luck!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> You'll know it, no doubt about it!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Well, it's like wen U want to buy cars, U wld like d best shape n models.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> isnt it illegal if ur under 18?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> i'm breathing now ... so i'll never stop saying I love you till my breath stop
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_15> DO YOU REALLY WANT HER BACK?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> kiss him goodnight and whisper i love you..
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> A woman who orgasms will want to have sex more than one s that don't.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> because laws very from state to state.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> i wouldn't try to talk to her.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> If you arn't poly, just date one of them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Then decide if its actually worth your time to date her.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> SO GOOD BLESSINGS WITH U & ALL-
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> if that's the only reason that you are brecking up with her than you are SO SHALLOW!
<NbChars_355> <LevSim_20> If he's that affectionate otherwise i doubt he'd mind.
<NbChars_355> <LevSim_20> time will show and actions will prove!
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_35> One: Why did you get married to him anyways?
<NbChars_315> <LevSim_20> A lady in the st., but a freak in the bed
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_25> if you dont, it wont be as good... for any of you.
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_25> plus relationships now adays end up in divorce so why waste your time.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_10> SORRY I DON'T WANT TO SAY THE NAME OF THAT GUY COZ IT IS NOT THAAT NECESSARY!!!!!
<NbChars_275> <LevSim_20> Who matters more, Mom or Her?
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> ;) Or did you mean, on an average, how long does a girl wait until she kisses a guy?
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> but if you were really stupid, you might have to do more stuff, depends what you did!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> cuz i love somebody i dont even know at all
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> And, I tried to make her see/feel/know how much I love her.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> one last advice: you have to want it as much as your partner.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> all can see is there face  & there voice sends cills down your back .
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> think of where her favorite places are- public or private?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> its girth not length that matters anyway.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> if after 4 years he's still wishy washy, he'll never realy be yours %100.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> maybe women aren't your thing.... :)    ;)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> first, wait for your sack to drop.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> because guys are really weird and they like looking at girls boobs ad buts.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> There are people who think they're too fat, too skinny, too ugly, too dorky, too... whatever.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> if you sacrifice too much of yourself then you wont be you anymore.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_35> If you even have to ask, he's not the one!
<NbChars_255> <LevSim_10> IF I COULD REARRAGE THE ALPHABET I WOULF PUT U, AND I TOGETHER.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> He seems like a wise dude.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> why dont you go a bit slower.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_10> LET THIS CHILD BE A CHILD.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> Start by just talking  say you know?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> if your man goes to work and comes hom to give you attention, why cheat?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> I think it means she doesn't like kids who spell it luv.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> depends on what type of violence.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> all i can say is tell him how u fill and u mite be 2gether after that
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> they are quiet because they like the girl
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> You are not over the relationship with this guy.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Just have to show that u want it.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> No Las Vegas style weddings, either.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_10> !UR LOSER IF DONT DO SOMETHING POSITIVE K?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> But, I learn and I have fun.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> Whatever you decide, buy it with your heart to let her know you care about her.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> i'll call you when i wake up, i promise.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> i still think u'l get a better reaction in person!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> stranger of the night i'll always love u
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> See how things go after that.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> me i will keep talking to him and calling his phone when she is around.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Hope yahoo puts some link through which I can thank u all without using a different id !
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> to me it sends the wrong signal.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Have you ever known a guy who didn't cheat?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Love... ...is friendship that has caught on fire.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> I love her and i want all whit my girlfriend, my life.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> If the answers are no to all the question then I run!
<NbChars_340> <LevSim_20> you need to get a new man.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_30> I want to bless (i.e., cause good) my kids.
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_10> IT'S WHEN YOU FEEL BUTTERFLIES IN YOUR STOMACH AND FEEL LIKE YOUR FLYING IN MID AIR.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_25> Never ask any questions - Always tell or do
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_30> i think from 19-25 by then you are fully mature.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> Hey, <name of girl>, would you like to <do X thing> <Y night>?
<NbChars_275> <LevSim_25> she wont be much else to you..
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> good answer....not so much from the heart.......but a good answer from the books of knowledge.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_30> No but I went to school there.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_40> well..why is she mad at you?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> I broke up with my boyfriend so I am single !!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Even if she came back would you honestly be able to trust her?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> Girls always wait for the guys to call.Bc they dont want to seem clingy.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> Maybe I just liked my BF to much.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> I always had a blast just playing games and laughing.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_25> But I am over girls !!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> does he touch u alot make comments toward how u look...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> well if they have a good personallity, is a good christian, loves to laugh.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> I really think it depends on you two..
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> having a girlfriend is not that big of a deal you are still young and have lots of time.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> ive found someone but it took alot of patience and time.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> There might be some but where they are I do not know.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> He will eventually get the hint thatyou like him and break up with her sincce he doesnt like her!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> and y shud u break up if he really likes u ???
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Friends and husband who clain to love you wouldnt do that!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> the previous night she asked about moving in with me.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> be the bigger woman in this.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Just continue to be her friend tell her later that you care about her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> there is someone so much better for you out there who will never dream of doing wrong like this!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> (He didn't do that, did he?)
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> and the rejection hotline is always good too lol
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> ii think the age is 16
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> when youre are in love you just know but the most comun thing are the buterflies in the stomache
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> I waited for him to make the move (which was excruciating) but now we are married with two children!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> ok let me answer u straight to the point!
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> ask to borrow his credit cards.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> you can say if there was no trust, these would not have existed.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_50> Hope you are the one with tons of experience.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> What makes you so worried that he would cheat?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> How about a nice card that says something like This coupon entitles you to two massages or something...
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> just consider if you think that it's worth it.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_30> no, cuz i love going down on him and he says its better then his moms cooking
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_30> Start having fun with them and making friends.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_25> def not a sign of appreciation.is that why u do?
<NbChars_250> <LevSim_20> see if homeschooling works for him.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> Obviously you need him to love you!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Not that we ever finish the movie anyway.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> If you applyed as much thought to that you would probly make all A's
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> if hes not cooroperting try social services.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> well you know what they say right treat them rough u get the muff
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Was any wrote up when you got married?
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> Are you really really sure you want him back?
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> do what i did: pack his shit in one box,sit it by his car.
<NbChars_270> <LevSim_30> It depends on your mom... Are you close to her?
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_25> date a leftover, lose a friend.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Not sure what new boyfriends are going for nowadays but I wouldnt pay too much for one    =o)
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> But all in all, it can be a great start to great things!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> these are not people who care about you or your child.
<NbChars_285> <LevSim_20> If I had to pick one though it would be...loveless sex.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_30> Ok bro, first of all you should never read body language to see if she is ready for sex.
<NbChars_270> <LevSim_30> Guys are like a rubber band.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_35> I guess that makes them horney!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> boys looking for a better sex.... girls looking for a lot more than just a sex....
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> also, does he confide in you as much as he always does, if he does that sort of thing?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> be a man and just ask.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_10> i'm interested in a nice guy with some sort of decency!!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> what your just dieing to do right now mmmmmm and as that fire!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> start by telling him that you guys wont be home.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> this might not work if hes determined to do drugs.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> I would marry him because he is so good looking.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_10> PROBABLY HATES YOU, BUT IN SOME CASES THEY LIKE YOU
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> If they flip you off take it as a NO, and go away
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> I waited until I was married...one of the smartest things I've ever done in my life!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> So you start to think about being with her in that mmmmmm way you know?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> But hey try not to worry so much, a relationship is supposed to be fun....mostly.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> DO NOT BE THE ONLY GUY.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> (she so needs to know this!)
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> its cheap and it wont mean anything to her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> If you have to ask, you aren't.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> do you two have many problems?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> and willing to take responciblty for him for the next 10 years if it doesn't work out.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Little things like bestfriends, boyfriends ex....blah..blah...blah doesn't really matter.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> someone to love, and love them back.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> u dont program urself to certain levels it just happens!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> What does he say when you ask him about it?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> You would be very busy and taken care of !!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> and if you dont see that then i suggest you find a new mirror.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> If that doesnt disturb your daily routine or schedule, its no way BAD.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> if only it were that easy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> no girl deserves to be cheated on and then lied to on top of it.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> heres an easy one ASK HIM!!
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_25> leave your husband, and dump your friend, thats sad
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_25> I don't about dumbest but definitely the worst.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> yup...go search your name..i found there to be several pages...:)
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_30> before  they pulled the plug  2 months ago
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_25> That or be sick for the day.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> And there are loads of chatrooms on the web, just be so very careful!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> but once they start they cant stop.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> I'm sure you'll be fine :)
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> Tell him you love surprises so much you can have'em everday!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> I don't remember who it was from???
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> SO DONT LOOSE FAITH GOOD THINGS COME TO THOSE WHO WAIT JUST BE PATIENT HE WILL COME.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> buy a green hat chicks dig green hats
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> If he doesn't like her, why is he with her?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> I can't say this stuff again b/c i enjoy spending time w/her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> if you love him enough and if you believe he is worthy of your love then stay!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> Just give it all you've got.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Some guys find there same gender attractive o.O
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> yes because she probably is about to dump you because you never tell her what you think of her
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> just because your partner didnt feel like telling you?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> u usually a friend of a friend of a friend is friends with ur ex.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> and last but not least: be patient with yourself, but don't let it get worst.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> it's strictly for fun and i expect no serious involvement.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Ugh, that's tough to hear guys say that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If they are crazy crazy don't go.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> Well, I guess you could try to find a skank and just f**k.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> could she be scared that i want a serious relationship and she can't handle one, should i move on?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> what men don't understand is women (most women) want to be treated like a lady.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Tell me what you make of this
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Well most guys I know don't really have any feelings.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> she says i dont love u anymore and she doesnt say the reason.......
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> U should probably just show up.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> do him a favor not sex if u dont want but just get him happy
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> shure i dont see why not .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> guys are broutht up to think if you feel your not a man.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> That way you will surely get over it.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_15> THE RIGHT AGE WILL BE IF ANY GIRL ASKS YOU FOR THAT...
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> they want control and the only way they can get it is through u.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> Look at you waiting for him!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> there are many many gods (supposedly).
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> It might work, but probably not if you get married.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> THE RIGHT AGE WILL BE IF ANY GIRL ASKS YOU FOR THAT...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> they want control and the only way they can get it is through u.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Look at you waiting for him!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> there are many many gods (supposedly).
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> It might work, but probably not if you get married.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Either you are gay or you're not.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> However, that guy you were with is a real jerk!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> girl u should go and see a doctor...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> now-a-day's it's mostly looks that we want.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> I am very happy person-whats that tell ya.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> REMEMBER THIS  EVERYBODY HAS SOMEBODY UNTILL THEY FIND SOMEBODY BETTER!!!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Any way I have only had sex with a girl twice so I hope you dont care about that.
<NbChars_275> <LevSim_25> You CAN be sexy - try it!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Name a star after the two of you at International Star....hmmmm..I could go on and on.....so sweet!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> yes i do it/cz then i enjoy more
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> I for one do not do that!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> Girls like to flirt, though, I'll give you that.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> but trust me, dont ever go back to him.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> like many have said talk w/ your girl.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> Show her you realize you were a bonehead idiot.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> i dont think you really ever know.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> i am now 8 mos pregnant.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Let me guess your either in High School or Junior High.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> try adamandeve.com they have rubber coated vibrating ones.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> This is SamE's fiancee speaking: Easy tell him you're not going to have sex until you're married...and then don't.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> !...THERE ARE GOOD MEN..WE JUST HAVE TO WEED THEM OUT...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Now, if he didn't hide it, I wouldn't be as angry.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> you don't need a girlfriend to be happy.....
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> you dont need gods love, learn to love yourself and all else will follow
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> on the other hand you can see also some women who are cheating on men .
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_35> That's one of the best ways to pick up a woman I ever used.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> PS - talk to JUDITH FINEBLIT, jewelryexpert.com (603 624-8672)  SHE's awesome and I trust her.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_30> in the morning...right after you wake up.

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I found a couple here...I hope this helps.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> Only if you like beautiful beaches and nice weather.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_20> IT WILL BE YOUR LAST KISS.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> just thought of the song when this question came up.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_25> :)  That's a good one though.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> Dont be a assaholic and say stuff like ha your stupid
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> just keep thinking about how nasty the other girls mouth is.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> I have a boyfriend sence 3yrs ago.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> hey i know you will find someone but you have to love yourself first.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> Maybe you don't get out enough.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> :) Give him a massage and then a hot bath, gently washing his hair and toweling him off afterward.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> find a way to join in a thing where she goes.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> because they used to masturbate in young-age
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_35> If there's grass on the field, PLAY BALL!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> She will think you hung the Moon!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_20> But do you really want a cheater back??
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> it even has the part in the book that talks about your issue.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> Don't act like a slug...get active...get into it!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> If you boyfriend is getting tons of sexy text from some male name, that might be a girl.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Knight Rider doesn't look so bad now does it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> But a lot of guys don't see it that way.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> Its not in the penis...its if you know how to use it!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> try it chat or somewhere else.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> I was just wondering because a lot of my friends do that..
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> BUY HER $10 ROSES AND HER OCCASIONAL WINE, AND GIVE HER A LOT OF LOVE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Don't just say it to say it.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> just ask her how to please her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> And believe me, you would LOVE it !
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> you did not mention what is your relationship with her.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> I guess by spelling horny properly ?
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_30> Girls never love a guy,,they love his pant,,shirt,,money,,fame,,bike,,house,,any damn thing but never HE HE AND ONLY HE,,OK????
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_35> yes she can get pregnant cause it's not very safe.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> I am so sorry about this Question !!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> you had better get down there and explore and go where only real men go....and then you'll know.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_35> That would depend on if he loved you before he or she went to jail.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> If this is what you really want and he loves you then he should be willing to wait too.
<NbChars_270> <LevSim_30> Wow, I feel sorry for you!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_25> So don't worry about embarassing your self.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> You couldnt see that from where your at though.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> crawl up a chickens a** and wait
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> for months i wont think about it, then i see her in the store i just break down.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> So when I am wih girls I dont care.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> You'd think a man that age would have finally grown up, but I guess not.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> If you are afraid of him yelling April Fool!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> you need to tell him you want to try it again and quit pretending to just be friends!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> but when it comes to cheating... never.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> just look for the gay men.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> Talk to her, see wat she likes, wat shes into.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> I mean, where they with their bfs or were they single?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> Or, actually is it weird nowadays to think about sex all the time?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> (i would've cheated on you anyway)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> I know it seems too casual -- but the relationship is so new!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> dont get something for the girl.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> If he wants to stay with her, let him!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> don't go to bars or clubs.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> (If you look good and he is still preforming sexually with you, who cares?)
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> listen to the blink 182 song stay together for the kids.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> the best decision i ever came up with was to let him be.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> you can writte in spanish too
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> That depends: my first time around what?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> i try to get her to relize that im not interested.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> teenagers can have sex from the age of 18
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> ( Sorry for my english, i can speak very well )
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> U think a girlfriend can make you happy?
<NbChars_250> <LevSim_25> Wait until you are at least 22!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> if you have a boyfriend and he cheats an you would'nt you cheat an him back?
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_30> ex girlfriend says i love u to my boyfriend
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> you have to ask to go to the bathroom and you have a lot of restrictions.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> you have not lost anything in the ex or the friend/fam member.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> think of which one u would wanna be with forever.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> And a lot of men have become use to getting over on women.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> he may be just playing a game.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> ur gonna loose ur friend, maybe a tooth or two
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_10> FROM YOUR MOTHER OR FATHER= ANYTIME.
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_10> OTHERS U COULD TELL CUZ THEY ACT DIFFERENT!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> can anybody help me figure out what im suppose to do to marry my girlfriend?
<NbChars_250> <LevSim_30> stay with the one you love and have sex with the other one
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_30> i feel really guilty about it.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> I don't think it matters if you act like it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> well how do you know her?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> snookie here and thanks i do that.. and i see your looking for asian another man thing huh/?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> back to me again i am 21 and have never had a serious relationship with a chick.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> I love fat girls.. and there r lot out there who prefer a curvy woman over a thin girl.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Is your girl an ax murderer?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> Well if you love him and are over 16/17 then yes...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> And girls that are still virgins (speaking from experience btw) are alot more comfortable with guys that are too.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> Put favorite tunes on the radio or play favorite CD's.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> I would not tell even with the gurantee - you or him!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> what if we want to be left alone?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_10> HOME PLATE IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BASEBALL.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> if   STERLING & REAL LOVE then Commune
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_5> 'WHY IS THIS GROWN MAN HANGING AROUND CHILDREN?'
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> there is no way you can unless he tells you!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> Oh and one more thing once and drug addict always and addict.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> u have 2 choose good luck
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> puhlease... borrow sugar once but after that she's on to you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> You should be friends with yourself first.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> i really like him but dont know how he feels.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> If you can't get enough...you love her.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> You are just saying MERRY CHRISTMAS.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_15> I CAN DEFINITELY TELL YOU HE'LL CALL THE NEXT DAY.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> NAKED FOR SURE,WE LOVE LINGERIE  ALSO, BECAUSE WE KNOW WHATS UNDER IT.HAY!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> He won't admit he cheated because he still cares.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> If you hit it off woth someone right away great!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> I don't know if i'm in love or if it's just lust.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Chances are they've done all the things that your doing now.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> count your blessings girls if u have a sex crazy guy that is focused on u!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> If after two years go by, and he still hasn't asked you out, then he wasn't flirting
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> Yes, and no...it depends on the man, just like out in the real world.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> not if you don't know what to do with it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Most of them have hormonal problems, some were abused and others just dont like it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> is it wrong seeing your roommate thru window while she dresses, plays with her self.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> Wait until you have a wedding ring on your finger!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> change you adress and leave him alone.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> talk about what you both like and be her friend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> there are lots of nice guys out there.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> just go with what you've pictured in your mind, i'm sure she'll love it!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> If you were so pissed then why didn't you say anything?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Either she does or she doesn't.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> maybe they aren't getting what they want
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Lingerie just comes off quickley anyway!
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> Just do what ur deepest soul says.Good luck
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> Not until your 21 if you ask me (but I'm old fashioned like that).
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> But i guess it really depends on the person.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> How can I get over this ASAP?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> 1:he should love me 2:he should love me more then yesterday 3:he should love me less then tomorrow
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> You go girl, you freak cheater, break a man's heart, just do it with a nice fellow like me!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> it doesnt work and will only end up hurting you!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Im just wondering if thats normal?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> I feel like a total fool.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Might as well just get her a ring!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> Not all men are SO sex crazy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> get dolled up and watch that suckers tongue hang out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> try to hang out with your friends so you dont have that much time to feelllike crap -Steve
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Alot of people dont like sex.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> ill ask my mom when she comes home if i can see you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> If you just jump into telling her you love her you might chase her away.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> Okay... you just have to know that not everyones out to get you.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> So here's your holiday  Hope you enjoy it this time.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> be as ur nature is , smile and speak by ur eyes
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> second, that depends on what type of person your mom is.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> Damn,   I thought I was the only one...
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> and to make yourself feel better, eat choclate or cheese(trust me it works!)
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> the wat to tell if you feel like they are hidding somting.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_40> well...you can always try a dating site.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_45> You either trust her or you don't.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> Over the age of 18 and when you get married!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> I used to hang all over my girl friend.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> My bf told me  beat him up
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> Face it girlfriend...men only do this when they are dating us.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> my husband had been cheating on me since we had a baby.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> sure we have all thought of it.
<NbChars_260> <LevSim_30> And this is just brutal honest.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_25> patience my friend is the secret..
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_20> dont just stay home doing nothing cuz then you'll really be depressed.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> I haven't had that problem that god!!
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_25> Women can get laid anytime, jut hit a local biker bar!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> And I don't swear like you!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> If you show him that you trust him (don't over do it), chances are he won't cheat on you.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> it depends on what of your's you showed me
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> If I am mad I will not put out or have sex.
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_20> like, when he calls, say, i am so busy!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> She wanted 'our' day to be 'OUR' day.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> What I think is that the age does not matter i¿f god says that its OK.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> Tell him you wont tolerate his lies.......
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> depends on how long you have been with her but i think be love
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> Don't know Do you come on strong?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> R E S P E C T  just like the song says
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Sometimes it can scare the guy off, if he is committment phobic...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Then if you dont you'll live a miserable life!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Then you find yourself in a REAL quandary!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> is when u think about dat person more than u do urself
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Why not a proposal to go then too?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> well most of the time, this kind of action means that he does not want the relationship again.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> Guys want to have sex much more than girls.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> You got three options 1) tell him you need to see him more !
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> first of all, why haven't u talked to your mom in nine yrs?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> but if u do answer below :D thanks!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> in fact ; alot of men cheat on women but not all of them.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> guys always leave certain tales when they are cheating.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Would you honestly not care seeing another girl with your man?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> that's the only surefire way, and with some guys, even THAT isn't enough!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> How comfortable am I with this guy?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> dont care what will be the resolt just beleive in urself and follow ur heart!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> 18 SO THAT IF YOUR PARENTS FIND OUT, YOU'LL BE OLD ENOUGH TO MOVE OUT OF THEIR HOUSE.........
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> Trust me, I was 20 and I screwed crap up.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> because it is a hard thing to explain and show those things thats why kids just learn evantually
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> No - men are useless at remembering dates.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> Something you do or don't do, he doesn't like.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Women like that make lots of other women look bad.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> God hates divorce hang in there....
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> embaress ur self in front of a WHOLE bunch of ppl!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> If they go first.....it's pretty much over.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> games- it's fun or easier, and they like wining.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> Don't tell him you love him, and try going out with him for a while.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> If you get one easily is she really worth it?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> Obviously this guys wife is not.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Of course I would be mad.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Ever thought about what'll happen after boot camp?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> You can't force people to like you if they just don't.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_15> A PERSON HAS TO WANT TO CHANGE!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Talks about himself...about how he needs to improve his looks...etc...
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> See if there is something (or several somethings) that are sexy and that YOU KNOW SHE LIKES.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> but if he doesnt know how to use it then it better be big.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> I don't know but if you find out please let me know LOL
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> i'll do everything i can to see you tomorrow.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> Just flirt...bat your beautiful eyes, look and act inacennt, and look adorable!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> all men react differently but you just know if he is trying to pull the wool over your eyes.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> as women get older, and even more if they have kids, are not willing to fool around.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> i left and it was the best move i ever made, while pregnant.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> if he says yes then ask him why he does it to you!?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> If you are a guy, you need to find the hottest girls who are having the most fun.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> So, try to hang out with him when she's not around, but don't make a move.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> either you are gay or you are straight - true you can be both (bi).
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> Marry the one with the big b**bs.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> i think it is wrong to say that to someone if you dont mean it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> i like the name sia and manav
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> 1.MONEY 2.HUSBAND 3.and a child  And finally  bla bla
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> SO GIVE HIM A PAIR OF GLASSES THEN HE WILL SEE THE BIG PICTURE.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> if hes for real he'll ask u to marry him =)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> If it's true you love him, then love him!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> just turning up after 9 years without contact may freak her out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> any way i suggest u to work on ur personality so that u can enjoy life with ease.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> I just saw your avatar.. now... here's mine!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> looks, personality, inteligence, sense of humor
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> asian woman are known for that huh?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> tell him that you love him
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> If your doing it right youll know
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> It's probably just boys being boys.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> If you got anymore questions hit me up at eidal3@yahoo.com
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> look first try getting your self-esteem up do things you would never do.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> SOME PEOPLE YOU CAN'T TELL CUZ THEY CAN HIDE IT VERY GOOD!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> I found out later, and much too late, that she had never read a book in her life!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> you have to smell good too, but dont over due it then it will smell bad.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> There are different kinds of love mum -> son love.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> You are not still a Slut....you're an ex-slut.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> dont worry about gettign over, worry about getting on with things.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> sorry GIRLS it isn't our FAULT !
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> Hope this has been helpful  ;)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> No, seriously, guys aren't like women at all, so it's not complicated.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> that is the best thing you have to do!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> leaving the place , or better , the country !
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> he will not look at you in the eyes.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> chloroform and zipties.. late night mall parking garages..
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> If he's not interested he's not.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> and you must start it, well because you admitted that it was ur fault.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> I dunno... tap his leg twice, or something.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> after you have define what psycho really means for you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> maybe he had already got it from someone else and thats why he was not in the mood?
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> most of all, don't loose yourself in the hate and anger.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_25> look him in the eye and ask him that.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> Tell him you are pregnant and I would be willing to bet he will run for the hills!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_45> necklace or a braclet but not a ring.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_10> ABOUT YOUR LOVERS , WHICH YOU CANT WITH YOUR LOVER.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> of course it is good for you!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> my husband is wants me to try new things in bed.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> Do what is best for you.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> some ppl do that to get attention by getting mad.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> i depend on him for everything and couldnt financially make it with out him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> so you shouldnt beat around the bush and either be with your guy or dont.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> because they dont have girls to fuck.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i dont see anything weird here.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> Do what your gut tells you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> break up with your boyfriend and go out with the other guy.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> A nice candlelit dinner and then give him a massage following dinner....he'll like that a lot : )
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> If they are virgin its better.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> Having their dad around, ignoring you?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> If you want her to like you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> they have been friends for 3 years and are both christions.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> untill the one you love gets pissed at you because of some stupid thing u did
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> I was an insecure little kid back then.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> She married me and now I hardly touch her at all.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Not if you're a man in the cell with him and he says it to you!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> ur child may not be gay...he may just be going through a faze
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> i think u should rephase that.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> (If worse comes to worse, use anything but cologne)
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> i've got slightly above average looks, and am pretty smart and cool
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> there was a girl that i was talking to in august.

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> In love we do it  to express how much we love.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> if i dont give her any attention she makes me feel bad by the way she acts.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> They will say:  I will never do this again.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> Most guys will be totally flattered that they are being asked.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Am a female myself i think she is afraid you won't like her no more.

<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> just talk 2 her she'll understand
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_25> i have been married for 6 years and have 2 kids.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> unexpectable persons mostly are amazing and unique
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Samart and pretty but naughty does help
<NbChars_285> <LevSim_30> I would try a pawn shop
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> I know emails and other things are private, and people don't want them spammed and stuff...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> why would a girl stop loving a guy who realy loves her more than anything???
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> I KNOW that I'm in love though!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> yeah it does, just like girls.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> BE SURE,GOD LOVES EVERYONE OF US INCLUDING YOU.YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND GOD IN YOURSELF.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> If you're the type that says, Are you ok?
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> that will in turn make the girl happy and you win.
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_30> If you are married u can still be friends.
<NbChars_310> <LevSim_25> i am in love with *&$%&!!!
<NbChars_285> <LevSim_25> what do u mean by that?
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_30> tell her its not that i dont like u but we airt ment for each other
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> Anyway either way you will know.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> girl, kick him out the door.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> even if she never finds out i will never be able to do enought to make it up.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> Problems cant be solve if dont have the GOTS!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> you play a little immiture game, like hey, who do you like, lol.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> Always always always.....clever wit (which is a true sign of intelligence).
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> its a charcteristic that make you who you are and also the next person will love you for it!
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_35> if she does it everytime you have love, she's faking it.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> chances are he likes you if u r cute , sweet,cool and intelligent which i think you certainly are..
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> Like some nice jeans and a small, white t-shirt.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> people cheat because they need approval that they are wanted and needed!!!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> What to Wear  So just what sort of clothes turn girls on?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> WHAT DO I DO AND HOW DO I TELL HIM?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> THEY SHOULD BE WHITE - WITH A SUBTLE OPALESENCE THAT CATCHES IN THE SUN.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Last year my brother stole me a winter coat.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> Maybe you should ask her that way.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> I don't want to see you anymore.)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Im talking about love and relatenships....men wanting that blonde bombshell when the right one might be Ms. Average person
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> - she just may feel the same way!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> u definetly shouldn't have done that hoodie thing.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> verbal abuse is just as bad.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Then, listen and follw her advice!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> he just does little suttle things he never did
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i have tried to get over it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> YOU ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWER DON'T YOU?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> ill say yes or no when he ask me.if you asked me ill say yes
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> Has not done ANYTHING... anything means anything... so can you be Gay?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> Dirt scums looks more macho and are carefree...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> just tell her how you feel and if it dont work out move on
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> When he's away, you wonder if he's cheating.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> she could have a lot of STDs
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> You just climb on board and holler, YEEHAW!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> in the end your gut is usually right .
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> no i dont having kids is not easy mmm and u must be thanxfulll for that
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> anyway, good luck and merry christmas!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> Is it what they buy you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> It does not matter you should buy the person a gift if your they BF or GF
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> If you don't beleive me take a chance.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> !--GUYS DONT CARE AS LONG AS U HAVE A HEART BEAT THEY WILL GO FOR IT.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Because they do not love the person that they are cheating on.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> because there are other easy women out there
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> Some of the guys I know are mean.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> Guys with no guy friends are huge turn-off for women (until they start dating you, lol).
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Women don't deserve men who treat us like trash.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> Walk up to him and say, I like you, can we be friends?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> Yes there are girls that are not worth dating.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> Call him and say it's over.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_10> GET A HAIRCUT OR NEW CLOTHES.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> How else would you not be able to figure it out?!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> AND RELIGION DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING IN THIS CASE.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> when u just say it and dont wait for a best time to come
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> THE ANSWER IS B'CUZ YOU FEEL GOOD HAVING THAT PERSON WITH YOU.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> if you are a young person that is thinking of having sex, i encourage you to wait!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> No matter what anybody says gays are wrong.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> and then she will be like umm...
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> What in the hell are you doing with a married man???
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> If she moves in a little, than kiss her.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> I say get an education and then worry about that!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> No there's nothing wrong with you!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> If they are in love with you, great.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> But this i know is just the want for sex and nothing else.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> OR SEXUAL INTERCOURSE IF YOU'RE AN ADOLESCENT.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> being hurt is hard, but you need to move on.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> its too bad women are not more easily aroused.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> you shouldn't be with them because you deserve better.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> Plus they get the best of both worlds by not admitting to it!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> I see you on here alot.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_90> u r looking in the wrong place.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> ALWAYS GO WITH YOUR FIRST FEELING CAUSE IT TRUELY WILL NEVER STEER YOU WRONG.BELIEVE ME BEEN THERE
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> you and this friend or just yourself are experincing lust, and lust is not better then love.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> with friends like that you don't very well need enemies, now do you.
<NbChars_260> <LevSim_25> it will make the kid happy, and you double win.
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_25> at least not in the wrong anyways
<NbChars_250> <LevSim_10> LOVE IS NOT THE QUESTION IN LOVE IS THE QUESTION.
<NbChars_265> <LevSim_30> trade her a pack of twinkies if she breaks up wiht you
<NbChars_355> <LevSim_20> o and hes a sensitive guy
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_30> but think of what the future holds.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> So you asked, what is god's name?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> PLAYER To EX- PLAYER True game is just what it sounds like.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_30> Try to be tolerant (and TRUST ME I know you probably feel like you have been).
<NbChars_315> <LevSim_30> If you like her, then tell her.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> start a web site called young girls then hire all you want with the proceeds from the site
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> and then think of something they both can enjoy.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> just go ahead and follow your heart.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> If u want a peace full life dont behind money.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> i think if i did that so the gift will not be a gift
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> Infatuation... ...says, We must get married right away.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> And no, you wouldn't see me with dirt scums either they would either be police officers or military.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> If you find yourself thinking that she is one in a million, then go for LOVE.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Just remember it is WOMEN they are cheating with!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> that means not calling him just a friend or someone you know!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> has your sex life diminished any?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_20> Dude-- only YOU can answer that question!!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> It means that his love so deep for that he would do anything for you.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> Thanks everyone for ur reply !!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> just because a woman is fat or ugle does not make them a bad person.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_25> And also someone to do the heavy work (ha!ha!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> no you are not fat and yes you can get good looking man
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> And who knows love better than books eh??
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> What Do You Smell Like ?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> Just between you and her,IF u can do that.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> If you do this, B is already implied if youd do bothe A and C.
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_25> I mean the girlfriend not the crush.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_35> men think it is easy to make someone happy that is already happy.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_35> bots just anoy us while we are chatting
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_30> If I was a girl I'd be gay.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_30> wouldn't it depend on number of people invited?
<NbChars_320> <LevSim_20> Once and ex leave them an ex.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> The man takes this as why didn't you call?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> girls have no clue what love is.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> if your desperate than make the move!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> And Not trying to impress her..........2 Much!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> i don't think he'll do it voluntarily.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> but i love him to death.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> LET THEM SEE YOU AT YOUR BEST.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> u better treat him 2 date...
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> the average  penis size is 5.5 inches hard
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> That way you can get used to it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> Depending on how u look at it and mean.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Honey, if anyone knows anything about being a little hoochie mama it's me.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> Hmmm... Vin Diesel b/c he's a hottie.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> there are some who are looking for that and personallity but most are looking for mostly good looks.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Unfortunately, all of em cheat so not good guys.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> They haven't been togeather for very long!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> i knew her, and he always said they were just friends.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> he/she might be the one you are in love with :D!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> haha that is a good question, girls like a flirt but not a hoe!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> I don't think you wanna be Tina again.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> You like someone because of and you love them in spite of.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> because guys are just interested in looks.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> And NEVER let a man do that to you again.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> Sounds to me, you went after a high maintence girl.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> I HAVE ALWAYS SAID THERE'S 4 THINGS THAT MAKE A MARRIAGE WORK LOVE, COMMUNICATION, UNDERSTANDING AND TRUST.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> 2 types of Love: Love 'the verb' & Love 'the feeling'.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> Right i just said it to you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> because being mean for them is to find themselves and being happy
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Then all you have to say is I L-O-V-E Y-O-U
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> Yes, but why would she want to?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> They had a bad first-experience C. They think guys are only after sex.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> *wink*)   Good luck......I'll be rooting for ya!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> you are creating bad karma for yourself....and kidding yourself if you think it will go no further.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> `coz she was a virgin before you
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> If you're a hottie and not a bimbo and he doesn't call back, HIS LOSS!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> SOMETIMES THEY DON'T SEE IT LOOKING AT THEM.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> don't worry , she will forget him when she will get 18
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> Little shy girl, I see you have posted a lot of questions.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> does he not want to see me?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> He may go to jail too.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> a partridge in a pear tree....damn it someone else thought of it first!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Or ask yourself:  Am I ready for a kid?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> i think the most men if like each other , they would don't care what woman looks like physically.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> at a special restaurant, or if you're outdoorsy, at a pretty lookout place.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> i wouldnt cheat on u if u were nice
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> i'm sure that any girl would be happy to hear it :)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> I honestly believe that most people are bent on what other folks are doing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> how can u identify true love?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> because maybe you can try me 4 size.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> Maybe you're just not this person's type....
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> you wouldn't sleep the first three days , but later things , will go better !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> yes you should because that very bad to forget someone birthday or christmas too you
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> I am gonna wish people Happy 2006!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> no my wife wnt give oral sex i know how you feel call back
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> May I take you out to dinner?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> so why dont u fight for it!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> I don't know why but I just can't help it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> and it's toolate to turn back.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> Just make sure the person your havin sex with doesn't have an std
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> we just think about us because we are scared to get hurt,and relationship come and goes.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> So b cool n U r going to b allright !
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i found the profile under there.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Listen dont look for love because if its right it will find you!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> well if you really like him you could give him a little more time.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> if he comes over on saturday say oh well we wont be home tomorrow and probably not monday either.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> Do women do this to men?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> is it really fair to love one more than the other?
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_10> PLEASE HELP ME I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> you have to think of everything..
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> I think you should hang out with him more and fide out if you like him back
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> i dont think the money was everything in your situation.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> just want to know 'bout general thinking
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> heres what the recording will say.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> and everytime i tell him its over, he wont leave me alone
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> The internet does have nice people on it, just set your limits up front.and patiently wait...........
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> she is living with him now in adultery.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> Not about how nice a guy is.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> no its not if you realy care about someone!!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> or else, go to a city and pick up some not-so-good-looking girl off the streets.
<NbChars_350> <LevSim_15> be original.don't copy someone else's idea.
<NbChars_415> <LevSim_20> its hard to tell with men am i right?
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_20> probably 20 percent of married people.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_35> 4 the  way to react well just say ie to me agian  i dare you  love, dev
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> if not, i wouldnt have him in your bed doing anything exept holding for your reputations sake
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> when you are willing to risk something to be with that someone
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> you wouldn't want to have a child and never know about it, would you?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> If you are just having a tough time...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> he has made no advance in a sexual way and they have gotten abstinance rings.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> The movie line, don't say anything
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> No, i wouldn't pack up and leave.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> guys prefer girls that know when to be naughty and when to be nice.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> But that does not mean that career and money are not important.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> However, if you still got some freak off in ya, you might wanna try some threesome action.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> because good girls are gullible and bad girls want it too....hehe
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> but i'll never go back, never.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Or maybe, men are afraid to hurt girl's feelings about it.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> learn...grow...enjoy your baby, i doubt they will.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_10> THE MONEY DOESN'T MATTER, THE LOVE DOES.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> BY HOW YOU PRECIEVE HOW HE TREATES YOU
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> and at night... kiss her like none other!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> Us Guy Need to think with are BIG HEAD NOT with ARE Lil Head.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> go to aol.com and find chat then find that room.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_10> EITHER IGNOR HIM OR TELL HIM OFF
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> it will make her mad as hell
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Get rid of both of them.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> But good luck, and happy gaming.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> YES SOME DAY THE PERFECT MATCH WILL COME ALONG
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> if u do this it is very very weird i still think its weird to this day
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> If he did it to you ... you know the rest.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> some people dont even have the money to buy things.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> If he does have it(which I doubt), just break it to him easy.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> 1. good human being 2. help other peoples 3. fill my life with love n happiness
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Maybe one day ask her to the movies or something.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_40> ignore the exs, go for the new girl and be open with her
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Would you ****WILLINGLY**** spend your life with her until you die?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> You wont believe this anyway ..But age 52
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> I've liked this girl since i was 19 y/o.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> hey your name is great....becase its the name of my best friend in chandigarh too....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Look around her room or apartment to see the kind of things she likes.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> is there any girl from punjab.i want to make her my good friend
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> you don't always get the response you want and the truth isn't always flattering for us.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> diamonds always show how much your wife means that you are willing to spend it on her.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> If not, try to give him little hints.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_15> I HOPE IT ALL WORKS OUT.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> names, does the child have his father's last name or yours?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> bE OPEN AND HONEST ABOUT IT AND DONT BE SURPRISED IF PPL LAUGH.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> i'm tired of all those ghetto @ss guys trying to be pimps.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> But don't be a wuss either!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> well i can't tell you what it would be like cause i lived with mine my whole life.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> wait until you have been dating AT LEAST 1 year!!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> u must choose one of them regardless all the difficulties
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> Except, you could start flirting with her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> If you get started today...you MIGHT have something in hand by xmas.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Not tonight honey I have a headache
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> See if she wants to have a go at it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Why don't you ask him to invite one of his boy friend ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> THATS THE EASIEST THING TO DO!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> If you think he is not, then dump him!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> its 6:34 on new years eve and im all alone.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> IMO you DONT love your boyfriend.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> j/sayin this happened to me last week.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> cause they are pretty and sexy, soemthing between the ears would be helpful.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> If she is not screaming it, try asking.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> What's mom trying to tell you?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> might have something to do with thier childhood.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> there are some lines that just shouldn't be crossed, know what i mean?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> i don't think u'll find easly .... girls always think themslves rare
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> or try to find my true love?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> for some reason we always want what u can't have.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> u have to choose between the two as to whome u love the most.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> It sucks realizing love never existed where I thought it did, but was a life lesson that I've experienced.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> Don't let egos to come in.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> or were you pisst because you didn't go?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> I'm 15, too but I don't worry about it at all.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> if you think hes attracted to you then go for it!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> Do yourself a HUGE favor and get the heck out of there!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> go and tell her, that u miss her
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> or is it just a physical attraction?
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_35> Once a cheater, always a cheater.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> lol dont know what type of girl u are....i hope i helped
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> I LOVE CHICKS WHO DIG VIDIO GAMES
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> just say srry and go off with some other ppl.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_30> (i mean what u going to do w/ a guy who's mama got to take u everywhere)lol
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> Ditch him you can do better
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> well u never will intell u stand up and talk to them
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> i had the most fun day ever!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> oh yes, just don't subtitute, use the real ones.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> I probably first told mine when I was a little kid...
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_30> Hi,your name here..... Then she will respond.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_30> Two: Why did you get divorced anyways?
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> (Rarely works, if it does be careful)  Where else...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Why not just get a man?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Dont trust... **** her forget her
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> If he didn't care he wouldn't have a problem admitting that he cheated.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> There are men out there that can focus on multiple relationships....I mean friends, family and especially YOU!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I dont know what it is, but im dead serious.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> yes i think some guys will love for who u are not how you look.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> You are generalizing right now......so why do women cheat on guys.......What is cheating?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> FOR BETTER OR WORSE REMEMBER SHE LEFT YOU WHEN YOU WERE DOWN I WOULDNT WANT HER BACK.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> Three: Track him down with a PI, like Inspector Claseau.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> would you be alright if you tried it and ended up hating eachother?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> !just go directly to what ur weaknesses and redirect it!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> How would U like it if U were married and UR husband cheated on U?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> commitment, Sense of humor, Love And some money too won't hurt
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> no sista, i don tink so.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I don't want to eat here.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> a feeling that can never be explained
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Do you always look your best?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> ask her out to something neutral, movie with a group, dinner with friends whatever just make it casual.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> we split up because he had to move.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_20> True love stories don't have endings!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Love is when you like someone alot.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> if it hadn't been her, it would have just been someone else.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_20> i always start my love letters with,  HELLO BEAUTIFUL, OR HELLO SEXY
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_25> if she's mad 4 a dumb reason.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_35> age aint notin but a numba.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> !anyway just always remember we are all humans!!
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_30> If you truly like this guy then be his friend.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> If you really like the girl.. you know what makes her happy.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> Where you always not so interested in sex?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> 3rd, keep your legs shut until at least the 3rd date.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> we say that we love you sometimes just b/c you say it first.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> And then I would think about 35 more years....
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> just watch football and take your laptop with you!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> wow....have u talked to her since?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> it's fun doing it and watching it to
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> maybe even a guy who isnt in juvinile.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> How do you know love is in you??
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> if you have gay intensions then try it - see if you like it.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> hey im fat to and ive thought of killing myself but i thought of the poeple i would leave.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> WELL WELL WELL WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE?

<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> or u cud txt... or msn... just dont do it rite in his face.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> there was a man in my life.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_45> if he did something bad then no if he didnt then yes
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> If you work with them think about getting a new job.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Even the savege & covetous nature of man leads his eyes to the things he wants.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> find your self a good man that wont just use u find a real person like your self.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> get her plastic earrings from clair's.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> GO TO THE DOCTOR AND HAVE A LIST OF YOUR SEXUAL PARTNERS.. SOMETHANG AIN'T RIGHT
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> you wont have to ask yourself that question if he or she is the one.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> You have to remember that what you children see...they become!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> Ask him, if you did it would it make him uneasy!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> 'Hi, I am blah blah) then say can I join you for a drink?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> You know, guys are not sure what to say or how to say it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> please send any help info that is available.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> How About   Hola  Just wanting to let you know that I can't stop thinking about you...............................     Hope this helps.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_70> no wonder your avatar looks so sad.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> I was just curious cause I wanna try with my boyfriend.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> depends.....if u dont care for ur current boyfriend...then go for it....otherwise, stay clear.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_10> HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THE SAYING THAT THERE IS SOMEONE FOR EVERYBODY?
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> I like nice music dim lights and mmmmm well I won't when I am angry :)
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_25> looks dont really matter to girl.Be funny.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> DO NOT attempt to do this with someone you know.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> If there are more girls than guys hanging out, opt out, at least for a while.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> its not a very good relationship if he only wonts sex... write a letter and neva see him again.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> someone to make them feel secure and treat them right...a best friend for ever and always :)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Thirty, because you know what you want and who you want it with by that time.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> well...it actually depends on the guy..... but if u ask me its a stupid reason to break up!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Dude its like asking what can i do to grow.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> Get over it, something like that would be a good enough cause for a break up.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> but he didnt tell me that he was moving his cosin did .
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> the body language... she will laugh at everything.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Only if he makes less money than you do.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> BUT BEFORE YOU DO THIS...go through your wife's closet and look at what styles she likes.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Oh, belive this one, if he don't want you to go or know where he's going, there you go.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> now i am working retail and i like what i do.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> NO if you hear that they are wrong or lying.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> if he is single tell him that you like him in that extra special way and see what happens.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> dump him..dont get used..u will mess up ur life and u will have big problem in future..
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> have you tried stalking, that tends to work.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> if he hit you once, he might do it again.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> You don't really have to ask her out persay.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> YES I WOULD HAVE A LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP IF THE GIRL WAS MY PRFECT MATCH.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> So here's your holiday  Hope you enjoy it this time.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> 6 to 6 and a half inches.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> both have the same level of perseption!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> i have a freind and i could tell him any thing and trust him with my life.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> You shouldn't ask out a 14 year old, that's too young!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> then you can look for weighted or heaver duty ones.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_40> Im so tired of him... it;s not even funny.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> There are men who are not like that.
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_30> If you want romance, give it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> and please dont let yourself develop a hard or bitter heart!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> well, 1st of all, most of us men do seem sex crazy to women.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Yes, even if he's in jail.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> They say its great to not have to worry about all the bs some guys bring with them.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> not very hard, if you're hott
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> if u r looking 4 a 1 night sex, i would say that person u meet is worthless
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> If you don't really care about her, then go for the career.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> Uhh, if you're a man it sure does.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_65> I don't want my son to know because he is only 8.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Try to find someone who is better and ....do not hang on to the past.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> I love ya so much I wanna have sex with you and so much more.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> )if he refuses/ he's not with you anyway.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> if your boyfriend needs space, give it to him before he cheats on you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> not only your body matures with age, also your mind and character.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_35> Girls worry about their skin like crazy and she'll run a mile before getting close to a spotty face!
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_35> :) much love to you in this hard time.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_25> Cuddle, kiss, makeout, and then help him get some relief.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_25> when you don't have to ask anybody if you are or not.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> it applies to guys and gals both.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> how to approch them and ask them?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> Damn, I want that for Christmas!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> just think about all the bad, that can go with the good :)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> you just have to learn to trust people.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Ipod with her favourite nos 2.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Part of it says:  Kids Can't Cause Divorce!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> we just got back from a trip that lasted 10 days meeting his parents and such.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> romance is the ultimate key... rose petals...music.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> work it out or move on and quit playing with your heart!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> here comes the train of the obvious question answerer and next stop is you!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> yes sweetie if u r  still comfortable with him u shud!!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_15> Bring her flowers...flowers are good.. remember that!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> But...I have a 'friend' that put a note on my car with his name and phone #.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> As I said before - Greed
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Yup that should about cover it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Wait until your late 20's early 30's.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> i would cut ties with so-called fam member/friend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Hi Sweety, I used to be bio.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> if you really care about your friend, find someone else.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> I mean, I like 3 different boys and I think that I may be in love with them all.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> If your girlfriend too aproches him then you should seprate from them...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> any more questions e-mail me at allarcon88@yahoo.com
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Homie you need to check your self, you need to only one and stick with it!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> The one thing that women need to learn is NEVER TRY TO CHANGE A MAN.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> THAT DEPENDS ON WHO I'M WITH.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_35> Youve lost that loving feeling....  affair
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> im 19 and married to the father of my 2 yr old child.
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_30> : I was straight until my 15 b-day, bisexual from 15 - 21,I am gay now.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> ok.. there is this girl that is absesed of me.
<NbChars_265> <LevSim_30> In a relationship, romance and talk, is a 2 way street, not a one way :)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> ;)  But do talk more when you're around with crowds.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> screw the roller coaster of emotions and living lies, i'll take the good guy!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> Any ideas as to what I should do and what I could get her?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> If he says anything negative about girls asking guys, then maybe he isn't worth it...!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> no u want to stay friends w/ this person right?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> just a thought...things that make you go hmmmm
<NbChars_415> <LevSim_15> So they like us naughty and nice for sure.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_25> (This is when she wants casual relationship with him.)
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> well if you want to remain friends after the break up then no unless you have marriage in mind
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_30> and you need this 3 things mature enough to enjoy sex.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> They both have very good points...and DO NOT HAVE SEX BEFORE MARRIAGE!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> I take it that you are a Christian.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> You won't believe how many girls hate sex because either  A.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> It is not just men, women are like that too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> likewise, don't get him anything similar.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> for all ur question u have to depends on the girl's reaction and response then her movements
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> try to sneak around and get an idea of what she likes first!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> well, lucky you if you only met such guys.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> Ask what turns a guy off instead.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> after u see that there all gay shoot them
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_25> To keep you for himself - not many guys want to date a p/g woman.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> i'm still looking for an answer
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> my fiance and i are going to have two weddings.
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_30> Just hang out with him, and act like you like him.
<NbChars_270> <LevSim_25> If he is a sports fan...he will be thrilled if you are too!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> I never hung around gay people being raised.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Girls that just sleep around don't care if you tell them you love them, they just want to fuck.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> keep your lips relaxed, at first you dont even have to use tongue.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> the last one i was in i married the guy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> BECAUSE MEN ARE GREEDY AND THINK THAT THERE IS MORE THAT WHAT THEY CAN SEE.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> i saw u said that u have been with only two guys and u r 21.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> You find the right guy someday.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> I dunno, even if she like you, and then she'll prob.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Because they think in the same way like us.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Let me tell you that really does hurt
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> just waiting for him to make up his mind
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> yours was not one of them.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> Like me in lots of ways 3.  mentally there, but doesnt need to show it 4.  likes math
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> because we can beat off to them when we cant hump a hore
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> you'll be ok, i left my ex over a year ago, and i still feel for him.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_55> No, I dont think your wrong.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> so try to become a better person at least u may end as good person.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> and the next day say srry again.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> but never stoop to his level by trying to get revenge!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> women can take the man out ,but don't make it a habit....lol
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> But once you are in the friend zone it is really hard to get out!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> THEYRE NOT FULL OF CRAP...EVER HEARD OF A STATE CALLED NERVOUSNESS???
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> i actually had the same problem with another chick.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> Women go for men with money even if they're total jerks and abusive, not for REAL Love.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> good sex is.... not all sex is good.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> she is ready to be kissed.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> Hang in there DON'T GIVE UP MAN.....
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> not in love but in like
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Thanks for playing I hope I got this rite (jk!)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> Well I used to call it cuddling with my girlfriend,you call it hanging.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> i mean it might sound good now but trust me- DON'T RUSH INTO IT!!
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_30> Don't believe anyone who says there is!
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_30> you should be flirty with one person and not every woman in the room... not a good idea
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_10> A FREND IS A FREND AND A LOVER SOMETHING DIFFERENT, CERTAIN THINGS YOU CAN DISCUSS WITH YOUR FRENDS, I.E.
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_25> I can not imagine life without kids.
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_30> If the juices are still flowing then GREAT!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> leave your husband and find a new best friend
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> If a guy becomes involved with a girl, does he have to cheat?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> give me an instance....yes i am single go figure.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> What did your best friend do?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> trust me girl, it is damn near impossible to stay mad at somebody taht you truly care about.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Please, Write what you think Ok ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> girls like jewelery, flowers and expensive things

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> My world is brighter because you walk in it...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> wow that was hard, mentally retarded or just fantasizing about him too much?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> why would a girl stop loving a guy who realy loves her more than anything???
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> jennifer lopez is the right one 4 me......... ;)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Maybe you are dirt scum, and the 95% to which you speak are good guys??
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> have you tried beer and pizza??
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> a lot of gurl will deny it and say oh i only like personality but we realy do.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> it kinda blew up in my face.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> Just checking this out,because i was curiuos when i found it.=)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Not all girls care about money.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> its called revenge girl and believe me, it is worth it to be rid of that untrustworthy jerk!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> Flirt with eachother the whole day and night... And whatever you do, PUT HER FIRST.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Both girl and boy are living happily ever after!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> get it tattooed on your chest.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> he's hot and funny and hot and sort of smart
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Best shape n models to d eyes of anyone doesn't gaurantee d best !
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> make her a basket of personal favorites
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> I don't want him to go else where.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> Bring her around ur mom more.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> yeah u can its weird but then again the way love works is strange itself
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> if so then just show up and see what happens.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> if not just turn her down and tell her how much you apreciate your friend.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> i am 23 and i have 2 kids with my husband.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Yes, men do need attention, but women need it too!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> You said it beautifully already, now just say it to her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> they care about no one except their self.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> yes, but they can never get divorsed so, but you can
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> we will probably get married one day and have talked about it recently.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> think about it i mean seriously what do u think it feels good
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> But remember, pretty n sexy gals also like handsome n macho man !
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> however, spending time with people you enjoy and who like to listen to gripes helps a lot as well.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> his answer is good enough for me...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> perfume...not too expensive, but it shows thought and care...good luck.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> yea the r and t are right next to each other on the keyboard lol
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> believe me i'm there i'm like that with my ex boyfriend and we are only friends now.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> they're probably little kids who think it's funny.
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_25> it worked 4 me i don't kno if it will 4 u tho... srry this is like a novel
<NbChars_265> <LevSim_10> NOT ALL SOME OF PEOPLE IN THIS GENARATION...
<NbChars_255> <LevSim_30> I used to go from partner to partner, with friends and anyone, even girly friends...
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> And girls do go for a good aftershave - that means the expensive stuff!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> Some pretty n sexy gals n handsome hunks stinks !
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> IM AFRAID I WILL LOOK STUPID!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> dress up nasty and do unsual sexual things ;)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> Sure, head off to the alter!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> umm i wouldnt get jewlery for a female friend.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> By the he looks at u
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> Go to her favorite store, go shopping together, make it a fun day.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> then, flirt him back to you!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> Sex is not that big of a deal.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Being a full time mom IS a job!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> forgive and let go, but don't forget; just use it as a learning experience.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> Focus on finding a mate, NOT getting a girl.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> WHO BIG OF A BABE ARE YOU?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> imagine all the kids that look up to me what good would i be to them.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> We want a FAIRYTALE at least i do.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> Tell them you are in love with them and experience the best sex you ever had !
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Maybe you really don't want a girl friend.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> they would never do anything to hurt me eather
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> Concentrate on school, where there are probably some nice boys you could be friends with.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> usually those don't last too long, but they're probably the easiest.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> usually if she's talking to you she likes you
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> But some people say that i shouldnt get to serious because im at such a young age.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> Someone who I can be totally myself, good and bad.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> well maybe u r too young or u just want to keep your free life.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> of course not,  go ahead and goodluck
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> I wouldn't have cared so much if he would have at least told me before-hand.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> Sometimes girl dont wanna start to talk the thing that can make her really sad.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> so that's what she might be doing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Don't expect him to pull this off, it's up to you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> do somthing really sweet thats says can't stop thinking about u.  sent flowers and tell her how you feel
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> First, it really sucks that you are homeless!!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> look at what she wears and get her something similar!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> He had been sick but now it is crazy.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> if so that might be his way of asking if you didnt deni it.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> If you know like I do, you need to wait.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> BUT IF HE OR SHE IS THEY ARE NOT WORTH IT!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> what should we do when we se a sexy girl?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> my dads wedding was for free cuz he knew the preach they grow up to gether.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_20> Hope it helps Most Excellent One  ;)  Gary
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> Once a snake, always a snake.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> 2) BE OPEN  TO EACH  OTHER  SO THAT BOTH BE COMMON THING AND MAKE SURE NO ONE REFUSE .
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> Anyway, I can’t think of more right now but good luck.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Yup :) I met my first boyfriend online, as well as my husband.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> You don't want to hear *anything* about her ex-boyfriends or stuff like that.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> But most of them are the rude kinds, make fun of you etc.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> after you said yes, no you are not wrong.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> You can't unless you are the one that filed it/
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_25> And if he or she didn't tell you, well.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> just kind of gently suck on his lip... dont try and eat his face... just nice and gentle.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> im thinking on seeing my mom but should i call her first or just show up
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> She is too young - he is a grown man.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> Got any hints from her or ideas?...use those.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> Does he take a shower the second that he gets home?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> maybe thats why u dont want to have a gf.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> It can't be some guy or chick on TV or romantic guy off of a soap.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> i dont have any money to spend on this.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_15> ALWAYS KEEP THE GUY WANTING MORE, DON'T GIVE IT ALL THE FIRST NIGHT.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> Thats when things went down hill.
<NbChars_250> <LevSim_20> get out of your mothers basement.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> the bigger the man, the bigger the ego which is a turn off.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> we aren't psychics..but if you have to ask..chances are you don't have much faith in the relationship..
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_30> I've never heard it before....but I like it!
<NbChars_260> <LevSim_25> try ur query using google.u can find many and if u find any good do plz tell me :)
<NbChars_280> <LevSim_30> and dont go with sexy in your name.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> Not at all - in fact it is a Very good thing if you hold yourself till your marriage.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> sometimes people cheat because they find no other way out!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> I know, this sounds horrible, but guys like to believe they can get any woman any time.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> You should just try out some fun hot sex with a guy and see if it feels right.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_25> no i didnt love my husband and left-kids are fine
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> I have the same kind of relationship so i say YES!!!!!!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> Ask her best friend for ideas  Vince C, Orlando, FL
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> just become rich they will like you then
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> depends if you want to or not
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> follow his eyes and connect them with his moves and reactions then u'll find it out
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> I FAILED TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION.PEACE OUT!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Because there not a real man.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> Just dont try to make yourself grow up to fast.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> But i perfer not to talk about that with the person im with.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> I know this one, honestly, I do.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> (Material- I know, but I don't know him to say anything else about him but his looks)
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> i think they have too much time on their hands.
<NbChars_250> <LevSim_30> Well, if he just FORGOT, that is not a good excuse.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> i dont have the haurt to tell her to go away.
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_25> She wanna talk about it, but she cant.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> or you want something really bad because you cant get it!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> As for you, don't ask for your gifts, that's pretty lame.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> for now at least, don't talk to him, keep your distance until you cool down a bit.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Have you ever heard the saying,BOYS WILL BE BOYS?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> Go ahead and leave her becuase she deserves someone better that a loser like you!!!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> If you love her, tell her.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> I have twins and I get sooo many matching outfits.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> are you sure he's working out at the gym?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> If not, and you still want her back, don't file either.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> If you like her, start flirting with her.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Making out with guys is really gross.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> If not, you should not worry...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> told her as of right now i'm rash free; would you be my girl ?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> why dont you just ask him?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> not if its importantif you just rung to say hi several times in one hour, that would be annoying
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> plus if you have children and things don't work out, where will the children end up?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Don't waste your time on the low-life looser!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> your perfect obidience in every way.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> SOME women tell lies...SOME men tell lies.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> If you chunky or not it doesnt matter its whats on the inside that DOES matter!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> you two only see each other for the time.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> if the boy tries to keep it secret, its still gonna get around
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> But I never let my family know.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> One more thing...don't use the word awesome at least around young women.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> Tongue   her til she gets off.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Go and have a good time dont worry about them.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> keep looking for that person who will love you, and isnt taken!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Don't think it is a waste of money, atleast its a way to find your mate
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> HE IS CURRENTLY IN BASTROP COUNTY JAIL AND WANTS TO GET MARRIED WHILE HE IS LOCKED UP.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> If you do, I guess you do (5 years!!!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> By the time I realized she wasn't kidding, she shruged her shoulders and walked away---Strange but True
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> Tell him to mature and start reading up on pregnancy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_5> CHUCK THIS RELATIONSHIP INTO THE CAN....CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE A RELATIONSHIP ANY LONGER.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> THIS MIGHT TEACH HIM A LESSON,IF THEY LIKE EACH OTHER HE WILL COME BACK,BUT WITH A DIFRIENT ATTITUDE.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> are men or women more persuadeable to cheat?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> If she doesnt notice you im here!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> So, I'm kinda sittin' and ridin' this question with ya, seeing what I can learn.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> When is it a good time to give out your phone #?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> I hope this helps a bit.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> The thing is she wasn't bad looking at all and I think she really ment it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> what does your gut instincts say ??
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> Don't walk around thinking Well golly gee I'm not at all attractive so how will anyone ever like meee.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> most women wont lie you just havnt found one that is going to be honest.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> wouldnt call it dating but hey if you can create all the necessary backstory why not.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_15> I'VE DATED A LITTLE SINCE BUT I REALLY LOVED HIM AND I GUESS I COMPARE EVERYONE ELSE.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_10> OH AND I M VERY OPEN MINDED I HAVE DATED WOMEN BEFORE.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> aww i love what ineedlotsofhelp118 said!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> THEY DON'T WANT TO BE PREGNANT
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> Nope...but I think it would be hilarious if it happened LOL
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> i guess when he starts to like men
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Why are some guys more horny than others?????
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> becasue women already have all the answers
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_30> even if its just a sentence.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_30> I don't feel right around them.
<NbChars_295> <LevSim_20> God, then Mom, maybe ur grrr if'n ur lucky.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_30> money is good but i don't go on looks.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_25> by her doing that says a ton of stuff about her.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> gone so young by amber pacific is amazing
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> did u say a joke then she thinks u are funny.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> i m not a virgin.. but i dont regret it.
<NbChars_260> <LevSim_35> simple is boring, complicated is not...
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_40> I like Craigslist and OK Cupid.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> What do u think I should tell them?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> She jumped him but he got up.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> Once a guy said, Nice to see you.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> Tell her to mind her own business and if she don't like the way you do things to bad.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> and i  want to call him again but would it bother him?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> five minutes sounds kinda wimpy if its a usual time thing and not a quickie with the kids downstairs.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> the first on,if this some extra baggag isn`t very extra:)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> he only said hey to me once.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> If you believe lesbos are cool then say so and if not then why?Me personnaly well I am one!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> why isn't he moving in with you that is the real question here!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> im also very loyal to my girlfriend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> No flower, no candies nothing like that.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> do not beleve if they say love is a feeling!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> If not, your just wasting your time.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> (dudes, and others, this is my cousin asking this, not me, lol, I dont swing that way.)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> BECAUSE THE GRASS IS ALWYS GREENER ON THE OTHER SIDE.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> because she is insecure and doesnt want to be alone, it is called co-dependency!
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> Help, I don't know what to do!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> well first, is there any way you can tell if he's been active on this account or not?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> If you try to find love, it's so easy to see things that aren't there.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> I do not do the bar seen because I do not drink, so what do you do?
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> or try to laugh it off.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> well there is actually alot of different points to this question.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> i've actually met four people i chatted with in online dating sites.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> You obviously dont love her if you gave up when you should be there for her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> no he is not a cheater.. the rings not on the finger yet.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> TELL YOUR SPOUSE TO SEND A POST CARD ABOUT IT FROM THEIR NEW ADDRESS!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> so we secretly ganged up on him!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> he really liked me, so i pretended to like him, and we dated!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> any tips to at least hide it?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Do you really think he is a bad guy?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Wait, I forgot a good nap is up there, too!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> ask her what she likes and doesnt like.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> So I thought I'd ask you.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> however he shouldnt be leading you on with pillow talk.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> i find it kind of new and interesting when a girl says that they like me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> FIRST, STOP GIVING HIM MIXED SIGNALS BECAUSE YOU DON'T WANT TO HURT HIM, HE WILL INTERPRET THEM AS LOVE.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> If it is, nobody never cheats.
<NbChars_280> <LevSim_20> if she says no forget her
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> If u will look at my photo .... maybe u will wish to have 3rd bf !!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> i personaly go for the guys with blue eyes and blond hair.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> And what if things do not work out?
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> coz i had it with a person ... who is my best friend
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> Gifts dont always mean he love you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I honestly don't agree with most people here.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> Was there someone that cheated on you, that made you upset at girls?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I never get enough kisses and hugs.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> people ask me that for my last question
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> Infidelity, I say never get married, marriage is the #1 cause of Divorce!!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> i've always been the type of person who falls for my best friend.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_35> but if he does it to you again.
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_20> It's just not worth the safety risk.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> not saying youre a bad lover but some women take a really long time to get off.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> you don't know you have to trust him
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> pls help me out here truthfully.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_5> MY BOYFRIEND JUST PROPOSED ON CHRISTMAS AND I DONT KNOW WHERE TO START.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> Ask, but never hide your feelings.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> if u like mt advice e-mail me at tech_boy001@yahoo.com
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> They are out there, we just have to start acting like one.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> folk got nothing better to do and will read anything case in point..........
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> Surf P O R N online, or MAS TUR BATE.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> If you just told her a funny joke then it is a good thing.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> money is good if your thinking about the future or just a suga daddy.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> suggest that you date others for awhile.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> I met my fiancee on the internet!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> Not all girls are like that.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> wait till he is ready if you really love him you wil wait till he is ready good luck
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> !even if i start to do dating by net!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> i agree, start seeing other women.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> You haven't found a good guy because you've been too busy with this loser.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> they don't give up the sex  answ3r3r
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> That is what women like, real guys, not fake guys
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> or ask him if he still likes you.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> make sure its okay wit your cousin first.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> i will make a bloody love story for our p.e.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> Because if he LOVED you he wouldn't put you down or cheat on you.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> First of all, don't just bust out with I LOVE YOU!
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_25> looking past the text..ask your buddy (best friend) what he thinks...never know..might work out
<NbChars_315> <LevSim_20> Life is to short for the what if's
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> Cuddling with my husband and reading a good book!
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> well that you will find out more later...
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_35> If he says he loves you but is not in Love with you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Maybe its because some girls have something the other gurl doesn't have!!!!!!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> I have already asked this guy out once but on a message and he didnt call back.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> i hope some body answer me becuase this thing really cause a proplem for me????
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> Good Luck and try to do better next time, God loves you!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> instead of focusing all ur attention on ur partner, you just think about other things.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> tell them the same thing i do .
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS DON'T EVER LET HIM MAKE U THINK ITS YOUR FAULT.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> There, I said what you want to say to her!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> instead just tell him you had a massage with someone and unexpectedly you had an orgasm.

<NbChars_215> <LevSim_30> cuz this one girl is confusing me
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_25> if u do search for it u may ot with a false one.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_25> men nvr understand girls...  ....its ok we nvr will
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> You know it is like a marriage.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> ask her for the DVD version, vhs tape will not last!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> show confidence and treat her well!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> I make great friends on here.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> He is kind of redneck type of guy, in good sense of words ;-)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> designpro has it dont ever give money or pay bills for someone you are dating.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> What should I do to flirt with her?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> And he continues.......  ......the next day you see it again.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> God blessed me with that special someone, i'm 31 yrs.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> or you could think about all the things he could of done behind your back.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> First, if you love him I don't see how you could even care about his looks at all.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Luckily I haven't had to start a fight.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> I clapped my hands and my face shows it too!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> BEAUTIFUL FACE WITH SOME EXTRA BAGGAGE.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> because guys are turn on by sight.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> you just have to do the research and ask around to a couple places.
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_30> its a nice question when u look at it.
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_25> Basically... dont dwell on the past
<NbChars_285> <LevSim_15> Then again-who says a girl couldn't have both:)
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_25> maybe that is the motivation he needs.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_30> And the other guy goes to the college in the next town over.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> People read everything they just don't always answer.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> TO GET LUCKY PLEASE GO RETHINK THAT QUESTION BEFORE YOU POST IT ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> A peice of shit that hangs from your ass hairs.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> lemmi know ..  as soon as u find 1!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> They like a guy who listens.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> hold her hand and snuggle, give her lots of kisses and hug her real tight.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_45> lol I am going to take a stab at guessing here and say 12 times in a week.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Women have it so tough these days.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> well.. just sit back and think... who would you give the world for?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Don't look for a problem that isn't there.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> Not until both of yall start going out will he like just you.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> So how and the heck am i too meet a partner if i cant talk to strangers!!?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> definately a liar.. and possibly a cheater.. my ex boyfriend did the exact same thing
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> uhmmmm how about looking for a job.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> take it from me its not worth it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> he's keeping his options open incase you guys don't work out
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> after breaks you should go to bathroom to do sssssssssss&sisisisisisiisiiisii....................
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> Oh, I wouldn't be happy with that at all.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> forget her and them then u'll find them follow u ... believe me
<NbChars_255> <LevSim_25> take it from me its not worth it
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_25> he's keeping his options open incase you guys don't work out
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> after breaks you should go to bathroom to do sssssssssss&sisisisisisiisiiisii....................
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> Oh, I wouldn't be happy with that at all.
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_25> forget her and them then u'll find them follow u ... believe me
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> if you are thinking about sexual things about that person, then it is.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> If you plan on getting married I really hope it's for LOVE - Good Luck & Happy Holidays!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> they are only uncomfortable if you wear em on your head.....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> You just have to be willing to take that risk.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I guess you don't:) just kidding, try your best and see what happens.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> apparently, this guy has issues... with himself.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Its not gonna be a quick fix and it takes time.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> That's what I heard once, & thought it was cute...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> My ex-boyfriend's sister and i used to be really close.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> And what would that do to your self confidence if it didnt?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> have fun untill the ride stops, then get off and get another.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> my husband made me a pair of half caret diamond studs!
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> How should I become a ladies' man?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> But what if it doesn't work out?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> But one time I asked a girl for a date, and she accepted!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> when you don't talk do u miss him?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> what r the things to talk about.and how do u do it inorder not to piss him off.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> O.K., those are my quirky turnoffs!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> no we actually do listen but you guys can give such silly answers?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> its not that big a deal,then from there youll be able to see where his heads at..
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> He cried, but wasn't really hurt...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> mn_sassygal you can lie to me any time whooooa what a dish
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> does this kind of love last for ever?
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> maybe not now, or soon, but one day she will cheat.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> :) Not so bad is it?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> u could always try just talking 2 him and see what happens
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> mabie he wants you to leave.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> if you dont ask you will never know.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> write & i'll tell u more  By the way - u r appreciated for your help on yahoo answers.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> SO EVEN THOUGH I KNOW IT'S REALLY OVER HOW CAN I GET THESE FEELINGS TO STOP?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> See if you can get her to hang out with you as a friend first.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> If you try to be sth you aren't you'll just look silly and girls sense this kinds of things.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> id ask her and if she says yes she cheating then yeah she has to go.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> it's just something you feel deep down
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Eats lunch with them 3 days a week.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Lately I have been feelin guilty for bein wit my man, but, thinkin about this other guy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> stealth setting are like the ignore buttom?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> MOSTLY HIS CHOICE.I JUST CAN'T SEEM TO GET HIM OUT OF MY MIND.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> WE HAD DIFFERENCES W/MY KIDS AND OTHER THINGS SO I TELL MYSELF IT WOULD NEVER WORK.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> when i realize that some one like you cares to ask me that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Most people don't even get that.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> Take a left when you get to hell.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> That way you know what you're getting into.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Because you're thinking he's not okay.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> - To a man = mon chéri, pronounced [mo(n) shay ree].
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> Hey, that's a cool necklace you have there!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> I didn't like the French way, it felt too dirty.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Not very good, since it looks like a whole bunch of people already did!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> If you cared about those days at all you won't want to carry on the really bad ones now.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> nowadays women should take the hand of control all the wedding side
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> she will also think of it as kinda dirty that she did someone her best friend did.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> You can't... that ship has sailed.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> about four to five times a week.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> never try to be bitchy, doing so wud only make matters worse.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> i think that means that she only interested in in only boys .
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> it depends but most girls ive met like mature guys with a good sense of humor.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> hmmm,i dont know why...but when im in a crowd i feel crowded...know why ?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> u know those things that a woman does that sends off warning sugnals in ur head?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> Wow, orgasms from just getting a foot massage, man are you horny!!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Never use a pick upline on somebody no matter how funny it sounds.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> U should only have sex if you are married.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> IM is a good way if you don't care too much about him
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> i would definitely go for true love!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> But that didn't stop me from the best one nite stand i have ever had.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> Yes ... and farted too ... but not during the same episode.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_25> you just have to find us.
<NbChars_270> <LevSim_25> We're all gay...it's all about what u prefer
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_30> If she just want to have casual sex with you, just enjoy it.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_30> Just say I LOVE YOU 2.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> a walk in a park,feed some greese,something like that.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> When was this golden age anyway?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> i think a kiss is harmless, so any age.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> Worst is, she will not answer her phone or e-mails to explain.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> I guess because nobody cares about others deep down and they would rather sit there in self pity.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> it will find u thts the only way
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> but i'm oldschool and think thats appropriate-maybe i am a dinosaur.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> lets vote and put it to rest
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> WHY DO MEN CHEAT ON A WHEN THERE IN A GOOD RELATIONSHIP????
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> And do it before the other guy does!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> Because we are just attracted to the opposit sex.Thats just how it goes.Try It!
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> this may sound hard but best way is: to start dateing again.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Like, I met one guy today for lunch...he was very nice, but I also chat with other guys too.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> Maybe you just ain't cool enough.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_60> be confident dont think negative make ur mind positive.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> Choose the restaurant......but say, I chose this because I want the best for you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> If she is not interested then she wont care abt you or what you say.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> Dumped her sorry butt and found me a good woman.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Because they get the male species hot!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> A thong is more like...underwear, swimsuit...  A G-string is flimsy, for lingerie wear  They are BOTH butt floss, though.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> maybe he had it on there and forgot about it?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> yeah they would , yes i image so if thats what they want
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> i woke up with him on top of me and his***** inserted in my cl*t
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> He's a jerk - get rid of him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> I found the person i was destined to be a little 2 late.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> i still call up one of those women  every once in a while to go out for a beer.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> most gays wont admit that they are.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> But the point is......you need to tell him!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> usally it means the cat/dog needs to go for the night before going to bed
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> you wouldnt buy a pair of shoes without trying them on... why should sex be any different.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> if you aren't happy move on.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> A friend of mine told me this is normal...im hoping she is right!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> now, if it was an artist that did modeling on the side, i'd be in like flynn.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> I gave up looking for the one and once I stopped looking, he just kinda showed up.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> let him watch some adults movies :)))) kidding...  ask him what does it make him stop?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> NO please do not feel bad - instead feel good!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> who goes to death by his own will!!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> If I were you I would question it and be worried...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> 2. don't ask do you love me if you can't reciprocate.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> Or, in plain english, ask her if it's ok... :)  -w
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> right now she is the backup plan if you don't come back,dosn't sound like love to me
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> )and if u don't u will feel having lost out on a important and beautiful relationship.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> dont harp on the issue as that will only drive him away from you  (guys see it as nagging).
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> because what you are doing is wrong and it woun't last well.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_30> Avoid it like the fiery pit of you know where!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> They aren't you just gotta learn thier language.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> Oh, and I like a good cup of coffee and sunny days.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> coz I am not a native speaker of english.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> I don't want any drama, i just want my dress back.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> are there not enough problems with this world?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> Hm, let me think about that....NO!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Don't ask her if it's OK.  Just do it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> hey my dear friend dont worry man.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> My answer... most men don't (from what I observed).
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> THE SAME WAY A SINGLE MOM DOES!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> i think its hot when a girl is a virgin... most guys do.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> that's tough, its an unusual setup.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> watch 40 yr old virgin that movie is kik ass funny and it will give you some tips
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> SECOND, IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER WHAT YOU DO BECAUSE HE WILL END UP GETTING HURT NO MATTER WHAT.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Ask your ex-boyfriend this question:  Is it ok for me to date other men, while im with you?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> and how sweet, and kind you can be!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> old and we have been together going on 4 yrs.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> there will be drunk nights where hooking up is all too easy.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> and explain to them that they should be happy that you have found someone to make you very happy!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> put down the magazines and go out of your house.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Did I just cheat on him?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> you might also wanna talk to him and see if he likes u how u like him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> next time you get jiggy with it ask her if you can use the vibrator on her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> and she is wonderful.. now it's a parttime job you don't like?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Some guy just want to have fun, other guys want something more serious..etc.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> How do I know so much????
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> its hard to forget things that were between you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> if its pass then let it go.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Well hun if u decide to meet the guy that is when it becomes dangerous.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> No sweetie, this is not cheating.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> just try to remember its their loss not yours.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> both men n women..  well..difference is that.. men r more desperate for sex..while for  women.. commitment is also important!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> In 10 years, when he has that big old beer gut, look back at him a laugh!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> (uggggllllyy)  anyways, there are some out there, but they are few and far between.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> just wondering cuz of the holiday season
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> honey i would drop her like a rock....she is not worth it!!!!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> if your happy but it's other people that are not happy i.e.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Not at all, you just want that special feeling you get from it.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_25> Love is MORE THAN THAT its that you just like to be with,work with and trust your life with.
<NbChars_250> <LevSim_30> Most men could care less if they married or not.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> ?may be on the street !
<NbChars_275> <LevSim_25> you already know what you should do.
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_30> Do you not wanna help him?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> see if she is your tipe
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> call her and tell that you love her
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> DO U THINK HE MIGHT NOT FEEL THE SAME WAY?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Casablanca  (can't believe I'm the 1st to tag this one)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> That isn't fair, and wouldn't you hate it if someone did that to you?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> It literally almost broke me down because he said our love was neverending and I loved him so much.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> because you're dating the wrong people
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> I am sooooooooo lucky to have him :-)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> However, don't worry, there are still guys like me out here.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> In my experience, love always seems to come my way when I least expect it or want it.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> then get out quickly/cleanly, take the children!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Good luck and just so you know i would think it was pushing it to.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> i like the look of jennifer love hewit and jessica alba but hey thats why its a fantasy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> Get over your self and let him go with someone who thinks more of him that you ever did!!!!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> OR  you could try casually starting a conversation about diamonds......that would work too
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> some thing is lets get in bed
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_40> should i ask him what he meant by this or should i wait until he says something.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> show her your sausage and if she smiles then she likes you
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> If you are really worried you might just want to get a paternity test!!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> how old is ever1 on here
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> Tell her that you need some privacy, a little time off, alone time:)... stuff like that.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> ya never know until you try it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> but dont forget she is your sis and no man is worth it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> outdoor wedding..lots of colorful flowers, jewel tone fabrics.no silk florals
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> it could be anything and he's just to scared to tell you
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> entice him by showing him some skin........ a sure fire success.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> After they'll b relaxed, feeling great & ready to thank you!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> 49-52 is a small group, you should be looking at the 40-60 age group.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> it's not as scary as it seems.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> you better give her a dinner date.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> breakups are hard but youll find the person that is love of your life.
<NbChars_285> <LevSim_25> Problem is, I still love her.
<NbChars_275> <LevSim_25> you need to leave him right now, its only getting worse from here.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> don't let her bat her eyelashes and convince you its not.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> What should I do now ?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> only guys here the the secretaryy is like super ugly and about 25 years older than i am.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> It really depends if the guy really likes the girl or not.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> not.it is not cheating you just  start or trying to cheating
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you should start your life a new.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> OMG so ask him to go study with you in libary!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> a 10 dollar gift card for a thrift store.. LOL
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Everytime I look into my girlfriend's eyes, I can see the beach.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> u dont have love without a lover!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> Is he SURE he is OK with that?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> u just have to be ur self.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I don't belive in the lifestyle!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Take a breather, (I'm sure he is feeling a little bad too) and go cuddle with him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> I dont care about the diamonds or the cost of my wedding ring.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> yahoo personals is number 1.   match.com is number 2.  you'll have better luck at yahoo.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> No it is not bad at all.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> So, don't look here and there ..... just stick to the first bf.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Easy... ask yourself if you would take a bullet for him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> But then I wanna be with my kids and husband.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Alright, so you and she have the same taste in guys.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> DON'T MAKE A FAST MOVE, BUT USE THAT GOD GIVEN INTRUMENT - UR MOUTH.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> ppl read anything they can get to.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> 1 of my friends cheated on somebody and they HATE her.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_45> but falling for everyone is not right.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_25> ok, if you ask nicely I will.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> Remember: Men are from Mars women are from Venus
<NbChars_255> <LevSim_20> cus you guys are a handful.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> Do you want to get married??
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_30> Hell, you've known him for five years!
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_30> The wilder the better, I don't want someone who just lays there.
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_25> (Interestingly none of them would dare date a black guy!)
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_10> YOU GO GIRL AND STAND UP FOR YOURSELF YOU HERD ME!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> guys don't care about telling them romantic things.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Whatever Jason says will lead to a war and will not be effective...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Barefoot on the beach with just family and a few close friends.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_10> YOU NEED TO DO SOME INVESTIGATING BEFORE YOU ASSUME THAT SHE IS CHEATING.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> So should I give him an ultimatum?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> fool me once shame on you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> should i hang on and wait.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> yes there is I have a best friend relationship
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> and if he says YEA, kick him in the crotch.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Anything less than that, forget it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> talking sexually or intimatly with anoyone other than your spouse is cheating.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> we're [the girls] just starting what they [the guys] did years ago.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> evrybody does it... try it, its great
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> whoever you are dating now put in on hold until you are though with your divorce
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> i'm yet to discover the same!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> Especially if you're not the girlie type.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> there are so many things think about first.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> The female brain is far too complicated for that!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> I know it sounds superficial, but wow....wear good shoes!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> But on the other hand (u woman - ya'll r sneaky and devias sometimes.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> (psst, it's the 6th string on the guitar)
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> so suck it up and ask him directly already.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> instead wait for the true love to find u.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> have a nice life.then find another.believe me there are plenty out there
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> if he does move in with these girls make it a point to be around.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> and try to do things for little money to begin with.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> if he's your ex, don't get him anything!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> love is not about the size... is about the all the rest toghether...
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_25> Never give up or stop trying, its too important
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> so you should really take time to think it over.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> if you are just chatting about normal things with no intention of sex, then no, it's fine!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> so that guy who u like is also a gay?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> if you have to ask that question, just walk away
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> honestly if they did u think they'd be so amaze with the fact that we have em too
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> She didn't want to quit doing it.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_25> My boyfriend and I just don't have much fun.
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_25> i think if u ask any woman though respect should be #1 on everyones list.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_30> not having much fun just now, are you???
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_20> u and the friend need to keep quiet
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> !but i don,t know wether it is my fault or society fault?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> cuzzz they are women they have pussy and butt that why.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Couldn't stop thinking about the other man until the one I luv came home.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> but sex is a bigger issue.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> go to one who realy knows what love is and then ask: Does love change?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> Some girls jsut don't know how to say no, same as guys.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> well girls and boys do the same thing.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> if theres a second date, thats a good sign
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> how i can enjoy her sexually
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_25> slower is better than faster except for the occasional quickie...lol
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> I bet you she will want you then!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> look for a guy who does not attract you.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> if their happines means more that your own.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> I'm a married guy that loves shemale porn.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> If you don't think that that is cheating then NO you did not.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> If they cant stand it or get used to it maybe you shoud move.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> maybe your not enough or good enough for her that she has to use it
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> email call drop a note yeah its okay to ask.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> she's drunk passed out laying there isnt she ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> its right next to your heart.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> k what he told u ask it to him back
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> Ask yourself if you only fall in love with forbidden fruit...?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Is it so you don't get caught looking?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> he told me he is tryin to wait it out with her.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> they should go to dinner and a movie.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> Sure, people do it on line every day.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_35> Cheap Trick, If you want my love  Now give me a 10, thanks.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> or if you really fear the rejection then tell one of his friends that you like him.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> You sure you know what you're talking about?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> DON'T TALK TO HIM ABOUT GUYS YOU LIKE OR ARE DATING, THAT WILL ONLY HURT HIM MORE.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> boys like girls personality  and their looks.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> It doesn't matter how much sex you've had, I wouldn't use that as a consideration at all!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> a guy that takes the lead and stay in control
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> so you can please her better so she can forget about that vibrator!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> sounds like you are just interested in appearence, check myspace groups
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> maybe he's after that green card
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> I say go for it and enjoy it !!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> ?,,,nuttin to worry bout in my opion
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> That's how men think, we're a simple people!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> because some people do not like other people.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> yes  and by the way - where have you been asking that question for the last 10 years?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> sorry im at work with no messenger.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> because no one told them not to lie.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> Just always remember ur family does love u and always will.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> you leave everything in a mess, and expect us to pick up the pieces
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> tell him the bitter reallity slowly with hand in hand.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> If you need to dissmiss him, then do that too.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> no i met my baby online and we've been together for 4 years now
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> I gave him a note, but he didnt reply yet.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> if u realy luvs him, juz go ask him whether he or not?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Not French ... the language of love ... the most beautiful sounding language ...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> WOW I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> But it would be wrong if you actually did it.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> if she's just messing, flirting around then a quite talk wud do.
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_30> You don't trust him or you wouldn't be asking.
<NbChars_275> <LevSim_25> But trust me not all women are flirts.
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_30> forget her with a little spit - even she don't diserve that
<NbChars_310> <LevSim_25> He or she isn't worth it.
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_30> the day she doesn't like having it, maybe after a few hundreds or can she count after that!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> i tried to call him but he is either not home or nobody picks up the phone.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> but you cannot make him want you in his life.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> HE RAPED YOU!THAT'S RAPE IF HE DIN'T HAVE YOUR CONSENT.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> if u are a cheater yourself u are certain to get a cheater.this is divine rule.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> How do I get a bf?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> it is always appropriate to tell someone you love them, even if you don't.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> true love...money will fade away but true love wont.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> dont get involved and ruin a marriage.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> If you have to start counting on your toes...
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> After u will say hi to her try to show what a person u r (im about personality).
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> give to her a flower today and a present on christmas
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> an ideal wedding spot would be near the beach on a sunset setting.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> oh ya there is always some body out there for everyone.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> for share our thoughts & love
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> to qoute sir mix alot I like Big buts and I can not Lie you other brothers can't deny.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> show her that you really care.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> But i do belive in love online!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Don't be afraid to take a chance.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> NO BUT... IM COMIONG FOR YOU I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_35> it kinda backfired but it was worth it!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> give him flowers.give a good bye kiss.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> sounds like were in the same boat.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> i would go with the artist
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> The word friend itself reveales the story--FRY-END,, SO DO I NEED TO EXPLAIN ANY THING MORE????
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> I tell him I don't like him he say's he doesn't like me either!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> Come on girl, get up and get your baby and leave the fool.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> and i was in graduation final year.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Did he ever give you reason to be?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_5> Being happy IS THE RIGHT THING!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> NO UNLESS YOU TRUST HIM WITH ALL YOUR HEART
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> And no other guys in the picture to be jealous of.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_40> if not then find someone else.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> i like to let my 2 boys and the big tree hang loose every now and then.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> Dun u have specific quetions than open ones??
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_5> MARRIAGE WONT CHANGE A THING EITHER WAY!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> there's  a big difference between a crush and love.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> hes a d!ck you dont want to associate with players   like him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Mom always told me not to talk to strangers!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> If you are like me...once you love, you always love.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> All men find something in women that they love and eyes arn't always it.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> (trust me this works 4 most of the time)Good Luck :)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> I'm going to bring my family with me i'm not that stupid.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> put the computer away and go for the real thing that is right at home waiting for you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> if not talk to him about it if he loves you he will understand
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> Do you know what your saying?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> GURL GO ON LATINO SITES U CAN MEET PEOPLE THAT WAY.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> they want all of your time
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> he's just not that into you.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> If he persist, then get 'ghetto' with it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> cz they too will think the same way about us.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> because it taste like banana cream pie!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Since you have raise the point,I realize that too!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> i wouldnt advice eyeing another person's gf.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> im asuming you are a woman.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Now back away from the computer dude...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> also compare them with a list of what you like/hate about this person.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> you should ask yourself if he loves you so much why isn't he leaving?
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_25> I had a crush on a guy for 3 yrs.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> I once told a gay friend to be careful or he would get AIDS.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> there's a lot so i'll try to narrow it down to 3 things.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_10> BE HONEST TO HUSBAND,LOVE HIS FAMILY,DON'T SAY EVERYTHINGTO HUBBY,
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> IF he gives you a bad time about accidentally losing it...RED FLAG.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> do what your heart tells you to do it is the best thing right now
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> Now, now...there are great dating sites out there.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> SHE DEFINITELY WANTS YOU TO !!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> no chance at all..i've read it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> for me i dont know how to lie and i dont want to know either.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> This is like asking, how do you know if your straight..
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> So stop looking, and just hang out with your friends and have fun.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> or do u believe in love online?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> You know, maybe they'll invite you over for trist!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> Be careful w/ the company you keep.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Brunette for sure...who said Blondes have more fun?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> If you're an idiot keep posting stupid things alright?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> WELL MY ADVISE IS FOR YOU TO TELL HIM HOW U FEEL.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> he wont be worth your time.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> there is no way u can be together?
<NbChars_305> <LevSim_25> Brunette for sure...who said Blondes have more fun?
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> If you're an idiot keep posting stupid things alright?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_15> WELL MY ADVISE IS FOR YOU TO TELL HIM HOW U FEEL.
<NbChars_350> <LevSim_20> he wont be worth your time.
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_25> there is no way u can be together?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> eventually, reality sets in though but you are still always happy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> a nice dinner a movie and a soft kiss :x
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I never miss an opportunity to tell her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> Does that excite you, guys ?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Just another way of spicing up thier sex lives.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> just tell them that you dont want a marrige right now.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> and what  tune  to  talk  to  him  in ?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> It goes back to the cave man days babe.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_10> GOOD LUCK AND REMEMBER IT'S NEVER YOUR FAULT.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> because thay fell something inside of them and thay want to have you know what
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> its beautiful, might be hard to come by though.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_30> when she says no dont be a stalker it will just annoy her and get you in trouble.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_30> I guess, she just missed her son.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> 1. for no one every to get sick and die only die from old age .
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> i was wondering if you wanted to go see a movie with me on friday?
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> its beautiful, might be hard to come by though.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> when she says no dont be a stalker it will just annoy her and get you in trouble.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> I guess, she just missed her son.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> i was wondering if you wanted to go see a movie with me on friday?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> if it does work, there are trust issues at hand.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> i want a beautiful girl with good attitude and a down to earth personality may be its you>>>>>>>>
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> I was going to simply asnwer 'about what?'
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> It F** annoying when I don't feel like talking(communicating) ............
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Warm cocoa makes peeople feel in love, you know!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> you should set things straight with her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> try to be your self and just start a conversation with one and hope for the best
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> dunno what else willt ake ur own judgement
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> she cheated on me but I still love her because of her courage.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> I told him i didn't like that and I wanted to kiss him but with no tongue.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> You won't know unless you try though!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> but if ever that happens to me, i wouldn't be able to get over it right away.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> sorry man - do u live in theran ?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> They would not love you if they did not care of your well being...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> NO but farted did i say that lol
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> she tends to giggle and become sort of shy when your around.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> show her the man you really are!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> Mmm...before you decided to left him?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> so what mental hopital do you go to agian?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> i don't think many are very smart because they've used their looks to get away with many things.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> It is definitely blond!Blondes have this special angel look going on.But they gotta be naughty angels!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> Just don't call like every 5 mins.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> Then give her that stuff and LEAVE.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> but half of them were  bad in bed so i wasted a lot of time on the losers!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> let her know you trust her judgment on everything and that it is all about her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> You are just hanging out in the wrong places.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> things that most guys do to hurt your feelings..let me know..
<NbChars_280> <LevSim_25> If you dont wanna lose here, just trust her.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_40> they also think that they want a listening hubby.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> I think it's more accepted that men cheat.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> first of all she shouldnt do that.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> gifts are not perimeter of true love
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> She just seems the kind of person you could just sit down and talk to!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> IF HE SHOWED UP AT MY DOOR I WOULD PROBABLY REALLY WANT HIM BACK, BUT I KNOW I SHOULDN'T.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> well that is jus my opinion but it is what you truly think
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> so in other words just be yourself and if she doesn't like you then she's not right for you!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Because women think alot of things that don't make sense.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Girls hardly ever use an obvious pick up line with men.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> (ok I also giggled.....but wow....horrid date!)
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> he may of had it on there before seeking for a gf.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Have a couple of beers first...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> don't tell him you had a massage with a guy cuase i think it will make him feel bad.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> if sex is very good to men do they wanna keep coming back to you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> WE MALES HAVE BEEN IN PRACTICE FOR YEARS   BEFORE WE LOSE IT.WE ARE READY BY THEN.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> if it is the past then it shouldnt concern u except getting tested but yeah u should just talk.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> It keeps everyone wondering where you are going and who you are going with!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> You should be asking a lot of questions.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> He needs to show you he wants you!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> Alot of money would be nice, won't lie.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> I pick it up and just stare at it.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> reality is that you are not gonna get such a girl.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> would apreciate helpl with this difficult problem
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> There is NOTHING to make up!!
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_25> call on the phone and ask her out
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> cuz love dose not hurt you!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> If you have at least 1, then your set!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> THEN EVERY ONE ELSE HAS TO UNDERSTAND.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> she will always think you two still have something going on.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> I going to wait 5 or 6 yrs after I get engaged .
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_10> LET HIM GO, SOON HE'LL REALIZE WHAT HE HAD!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> Since you already called him once, donot call him again.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> whta is the right words that i should say to this kind of man?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> i would have to say yes,i would not say that unless i liked the girl
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> the guy above please note that its grammar and not grammer.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> its a good place to lay were head on and because they dont have boobs.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> as long as you are good to her, and its ok with her, then yes, stay with her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I was a good looking guy to begin with but I was just shy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Sitting at the beach, watching my kids play.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Shell think that ur way 2 serious to start.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> Oh I so have the same problem.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> whch ever ones work out more (depends)
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> theres some things that need to change or i'll leave and i can't even get him to listen
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> GIMME 10 POINTS PLEASE  AND  CALL FOR VOTING
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> Having one girl that you really care about can be very satisfing.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> I wasn't doing it for the money but because I loved him.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> HAVE YOUR FRIEND FIND OUT IF SHE LIKES YOU AND THEN GO FROM THERE
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> Then proceed to have cyber sex cam to cam!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> Or do what the other guy said, large members work too.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> But don't just go in at the speed of light!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> you shouldn't have to try to get a boyfriend, it should just happen.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> Us guys only think one way and thats the easiest way to get punani.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Just be yourself, treat her nice, give her a date she'll never forget
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> And boy was that a mistake!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> oooo girls like to be complimented.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Try to flirt and then be cold.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> But even then... you best bet would be child support.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Some guy liked me when i was in 6th grade and it wasn't sincere.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> give her a red bull and she'll fly away just like in the commertial
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> YES, your baby's father is your husband only
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> If you are sexually attracted to the same sex then you are GAY!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> no, date who u want to date, it will be ur girlfriend so ull want to like her
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> C'mon man, if you really love this woman, you won't cheat on her.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> if woman has royal blood she better not get married cuz that blood is not sposed to mix
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> honey, if it's taken him this long, probably not
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> Isn't that trying to gow up a little too fast?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> (There's more questions coming about her.....HELP ME OUT HERE PLS)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> we dont wanna be thought of as 'easy'.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> dude, if u think she likes u, go for it, if u think she doesn't, look for someone else!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> Her ex-husband cheated on her, so she cheated on him to get back at him and then left him.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Lets refraise ur Q: why do Weird guys confess to me?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_20> Oh my gosh, your on cloud 9.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> it is not all about the sex.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> I had butterflies in my stomach b/c he scared me.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> I know u heard this b4.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> if you don't tell her, then nothing will ever really happen.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> HOW DO I DEAL WITH IT?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> neither ill just keep dating my girlfriend
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> thing and tie yourself to just one person...you should be getting to know all sorts of guys.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> the cougars are out there...and they will find you.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> maybe his is a virgin, or possibly waiting til he's married, maybe he has a std or small penis.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> if you guys are friends i think it is best to just stay that way.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> She said she is gonna call me and let me know.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> What is wrong in it, if she likes another guy and have friendship with him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> a ring is just a ring
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> i wouldn't put up with it if he says he wants to marry me, because marriage is permanent.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> SURELY YOU ARENT THAT DESPERATE THAT YOU HAVE TO GO ON AN ADULT SITE.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Only if the girls are sexy though.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> Just that the girl is straight(not a lesbian) and somewhat immature.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> You just sort of have to help it become perfect.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> The situation i'm in now, my guy has to go threw catholism classes.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> there is no future in it
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> sometimes the boys that dont talk that much pay more attention to their girlfriends when they get 1
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Maybe he wont mind if you werent even there
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> shell flirt with you and be nice to you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> I'd be a rich mofo right now.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> The only thing I regret is that I married the wrong person...lol!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> If he is a geek or nerd  thinkgeek.com
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> some place that is not full of noise !
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> And please, don't ever get married simply for that reason.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> yes it is because then she would have to cheat and that would not be good
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> think of things to say to him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> jst say tht he's the best thing tht ever happnd to u in ur life...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> There are a lot of stupid questions on here... like who emailed me last!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Every girl wants to be asked out!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> but if she doesn't like you back that way she will feel akward around you after that
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> well.. when u feel that that the person u like..gets on the top of ur priority list!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> dont  ask sexual or questions that pertain to the crap that she usually gets at a club!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> 2, and u now wat 1 of them barely even talkz 2 me and treatz me like crap!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Girls like to play hard to get... not knowing the age here..
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> how u  can be sure   that    the   wife too is not cheating the husband.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> A lot of guys want that too.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> well do you want to marry me then sence its so urgert to you that i am.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> Listen & listen & listen & listen & then talk.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> HE WAS PROBABLY THE ONLY MAN I EVER TRULY LOVED.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> and what i should do to overcome this proplem???
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> that would win me over in a heart beat!
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_40> money, cheating, in laws, no time spent together
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> u had to ask : does the exist love??
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_55> Milk In La Frigerator or My Ignorant Little Friend
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> His girl hitting on another guy right in front of him.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> it's either your appreciated or funny or you got something on your face
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> also, ask yourself, do you feel bad after doing it?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> ask her if you can buy her something to drink and sit and chat for a bit!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> not interested in rekindling the love you once had.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> tell him that there is a a sports ilusttrated swim suit model out side waiting for him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If you are the same age go with friends and check it out
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> do you really mean that because i think it is really bad to date online
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> You ask him to stop and he wont hes bisexual.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> well, first off she put boys instead of men.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_30> But, if you would risk your own life to defend his...  then you are in love!!
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_25> sometimes i feel i should because he dont see her anymore.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> The best advice my mother ever gave me was Marry your best friend!
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_10> YOU DONT NEED THAT IN YOUR LIFE.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> AND WHY DO WOMEN CHEAT WHEN THEY HAVE SOMETHING REAL GOOD????????????
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> The guy's got issues he needs to work out.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> i am 26 years old and untill now i don,t have girl friend?i know nobody believe that !!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> flirting is healthy...cyber sex is cheating....
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> I am in my mid 50's.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> if u meet nice boi then they would like 4 just doing u.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> maybe he is a christian and he beleives that u should not have sex untill after u are married.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> As for your answer.......I wish I were an 8 ball......a prophetic soul.......but I'm not.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Damn... now if only I could take my own advice, lol!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> thats what i did and it worked.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> You just have a high sex drive.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> bECAUSE GUY ARE SICK PERVERTS WHO MAKE US THINK THAT!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Of course you shouldn't go out with him!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> like they all said very slim!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> Try to meet real woman off-line...that's the hard thing, huh?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> But I also cherish my female friends because they are awesome, too!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> If you do what this then keep doing what your doing.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> Dear, You are friend even now.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> maybe he actully did lose your phone number and he likes you back.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_30> ask her about her and seem interested in what she says!
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_10> THIS WILL BE HARD IF YOUR REALLY REALLY SERIOUS.
<NbChars_260> <LevSim_10> TREAT HER LIKE IT WAS THE FIRST MOMENT THAT YOU FELL IN LOVE WITH HER.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> what if it was a part-time job you didn't even like anyway?
<NbChars_270> <LevSim_25> well if u can amange a long future with them then your in love
<NbChars_285> <LevSim_25> have a talk about it with her dont yell or get in a fight.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> maybe he thinks that ur trying to break up wit him or tell him sumthing that he won't like...maybe!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> tell him you're pregnant and see what happens
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> what would a woman do that would make u faithful to her and eat from her palms?
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_25> most women are pretty shy about voicing what gets them off.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> listen this happend to me alot.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> am i going to believe in him?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Couple here    Not often enough, cause of the Kids!!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> I KNOW YOU LOVE YOUR FAMILY, BUT THIS IS YOUR CHOICE AND YOUR FUTURE CHOOSE IT WISELY.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Dont take it seriously I dont mean it in a bad way.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> find a girl that you like and treat her nicely and just be your self.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> if U wanna have a relationship online, just keep it at that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> My fvorite aunt is dying, I can not take anymore deaths!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Myself, I always stick with the can't go wrong routine.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> Get on the net on a webcam.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> go to a nice restraunt and eat n talk
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> then again, if its not from before you guys got together then yes, he is a cheater.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> men w/ men is not beneficial to anything, man with woman makes life!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> Once they start looking, we girls can get whatever we want from them :P
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> I told him to call me and he had not.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> guys are more about what you do -action based expressions.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> well, if you really like her...I don't think I would ask her out...have you heard the term rebound...?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Why can't you ask him out?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> If he loves you... he loves you!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> i joined her in her english coaching class.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> always smile and be energetic.girls dont fall for money u can have cute gals around u with ur humor.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> And, how do you determine, if you like the them, once you meet?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> neither are what you would want him to think if it's not true.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> be clean and neat, smile, self confidence, self-confidence, no real woman wants a weak scared man!!!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> well girls have a tendency to think they are acting different when they actually are not acting any different.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> you know she wont be obsesive or anything like that.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> yes and i have done so in the past.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> this guy choose the option of not reciving instant msg
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Hmmm...well, wait to see what happens with the guy and his girlfriend.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Well if you're not just trying to pick her up you have nothing to worry about.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> all women love it but most guys are to stupid to realize it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> I agree with NOT just offering her unsolicited advice...what a turn-off!!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Best of luck to you Jolly Roger!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> be yourself after all thats what your best at so take my advice go with yourself
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> Go to my 360 and check a few pics i have listed.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> Girl, if you view your Grandmother as fabulous and fun, Go!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> as one of her interests in an online profile?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> Guys think about sex all the time too...probably more than you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> For my wife and I (30 yrs) on my birthday.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> Well I don't have a Britney Spears, but I do have a beautiful wife.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I dont live anywhere near that place...
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_25> NO....dump him and find another one
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Regardless of what anyone else thinks.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> Why do YOU HaVe-To have This gal???
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> Bang his best friend, have someone videotape it(or tape it yourself) and then make him watch it!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> I almost always have to initialize the quick pecks during the day!!
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_35> No once a cheat always a cheat.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> I think it is not sufficient to give one's views...u should specify details
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> And her cousin, and her neighbors.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Just pick the one you like
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> I didn't die or even explode.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> but that would be too direct.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> WELL,EVERY WOMAN/MAN WOUL LIKE LOVE BETTER,EVEN IF THEY DON'T ADMITTED.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> just tell htem that you havent found the one yet.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Or you lived in the gay part of Hollywood and the gayness just sucked you in!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> U NEVER NEVER KNOW WHAT SHE FEELS.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> Take him a beer and say sorry about that stupid argument.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Also, don't EVER give a girl money.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> Cuddling on the couch and watching tv with my family!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> most of the tim eits for sex
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> everyone knows what is the love,but no one can explain what is it
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> you can get close to them by either dating them or to have sex
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> Of course I don't live in NYC.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> we are not complicated is just that we are too cute to get what we want
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> There's one nice thing about having a car without auto-locks...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> Then go ahead and stay with him/her if you want.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> When in Rome, you know the rest.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> :-)  Sorry, did you mean something else?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> 1-200 box , for this month rent .
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> pay a random girl to spread a rumor that u r great in bed and have a huge member
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> Coz My Partner is a Good Player!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> There are a lot of handsome guys.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_15> WE SPLIT OVER A YEAR AGO.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> I wear thongs because they are sexy and they turn on men!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> And no, I do not regret it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> We have a 1 year old lil girl together.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> he si the most coolest guy in school.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_45> 3- a toy for my baby .
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> i start believe that girls like only rich guy with muscular body and nice hair style??
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> most guys i know with looks are absolutely pig-headed, don't have a personality, or are completely stupid.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> a lot i can't count.lol.no seriously i think about 25...gee!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> well, i play the drumset, but i'm not hot!
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_25> just ask someone u like out
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> How well should I know a guy, before meeting him in person?
<NbChars_260> <LevSim_5> B/C MARRIAGE CHANGES EVERYTHING IN THE RELATIONSHIP!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> if they keep callin you AFTER..you tell them to quit callin.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_30> Hi, you like me, do you think i like you too???
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> At present I don't have money for day care, maids etc.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> just tell him youd like to go out sometime?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> they are just afraid to be alone!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> but he is a real nice guy.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> Even now i am 39 years old.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> i think you should think about this.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Start there and she will lead the way to the rest.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> first you cant allow or unallow him to do anything.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> if they cant believe you and get passed that then they arent your true friends.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> There is not just one answer as their are also sex addictions, mid life crisis etc.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> just ask her or comment on what ever she is looking at or doing and then go from there
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> remember the grass is always greener on the other side, until you get there.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> macsteed/blondegyrl2004:  the long and short of it.

<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> maybe she is telling you that you please her so you wont feel bad.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> i'll agree that you just need to tell her how you feel.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> Sometimes I love something or someone so much that when they let me down.......I HATE IT!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> They like mature guys because they want someone who know what he's doing and not trying...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> now thats a quesion worth answering

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If its not right then way waste anymore time thinking about it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> im not sure that it is nagging.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> it's all biologicial and dont let anyone tell you different.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> yourself is a best gift for your lover,trust me
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> if you dont you will never will find the person.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> It depends on who dumped who.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> (member of a) body men specially picked and trained for carrying out raids and making assaults

<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> 0% unless you are a computer you read it while writing it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> no why should u suffer .
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> do you trust people online ?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> But DO NOT LET HIM USE THIS AS AN EXCUSE.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> thats wat i want a rock hotty but not a sex freak
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> I would invest any time you have in learning about attraction......  Hope this helps....
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Seeing each other is not dating it can be that yall are just friends.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> Then let me give u a little advise on how to get her to go out with u.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Read his book - UltraMarathon Runner
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> Can all u girls help me out with this>
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> just tell him to back off.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> because if she likes him there might be problems in ur relationship.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> Good god, leave the skimpy underware to the girls!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> They know the laws here too, I think its if they marry for 2yrs.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> cocky guys or guys with the playboy mentality are BIG turn offs.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> If you already done the best you could?
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> because if she likes him there might be problems in ur relationship.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> Good god, leave the skimpy underware to the girls!
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_30> They know the laws here too, I think its if they marry for 2yrs.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> cocky guys or guys with the playboy mentality are BIG turn offs.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> If you already done the best you could?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Also, in top ten is: i'm a lesbian, but i'll make an exception with you...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> depends the age honey....really, no timje is the best time...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> show her that you like her by asking her out to the movies and going places with her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> and a ring cannot influence that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> if you like her enough to risk that friendship just be honest with her.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> The rest look at men for sex.
<NbChars_295> <LevSim_25> and its either to feel sexy or to not have a panty line
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> I hope I am a big help b/c I have a 13 year old guy friend, too!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> *looks in the mirror*   There she is!!!!
<NbChars_250> <LevSim_25> you should never speak to him again
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Before she slaps you and think you are a complete perv… and the world goes to hell...  :)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> I'd rather not have a slender girl.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Buy a ring, get down on one knee...women are allowed to propose too, you know!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Bummer... Really don't drag that cross around ....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> 6 at school...once after and once on the phone...i think im winning (in the non-married catagory)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> you feel you love him but he makes it hard for you not to like him!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> you could try to think about all the bad things he's done.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> My wife has no idea that I do this.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Good Luck to both of you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Gotta have trust in a marriage.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> know what your lover want best and get it if you can affort it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> tell them to mind there own business.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> i like this girl but i think she doesnt like me back what do i do?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> If he is worth marrying he will wait and you should wait.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> You can also try the Yahoo!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> I wonder how would *you* help her out?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> If it CAN happen, it WILL happen  :)  Cheers!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> But don't act like this didn't happen.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> well, i am a 30 years old guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> tell him your true feelings and you might be suprised.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> fool me twice shame on me.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> Well i just want to try and get him to like me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i like the blonde, but i love the dark red.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> All the while watching her go through guy after guy.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_30> So when I don't get it enough, I go searchin for the boy to give it to me!
<NbChars_330> <LevSim_20> Rule 2: If she's wrong, reread rule 1 :)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> and what purpose does it serve other than fulfilling two confused peoples lust for one another!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> LIfe is complicated and its just the way it is.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> That joke about the baby was funny.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> If not, break up with your girlfriend and do what you want.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> what do girls want from a guy?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> guys dont play games only girls do
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> if you would have asked us earlier, you could have got a YES long back!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> he used to be really sweet and do things for me.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> Good luck with your shopping :)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Adam... and ask him... why man have you made this stupid mistake... :P
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> yes they do like to be held and cuddled alot
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> if u know u guys got something and u trust her then ask her about it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> he says he loves me and wants to marry me, but had his photo on match.com
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> I would get rid of her ASAP.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> Adam... and ask him... why man have you made this stupid mistake... :P
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> yes they do like to be held and cuddled alot
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> if u know u guys got something and u trust her then ask her about it.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> he says he loves me and wants to marry me, but had his photo on match.com
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_30> I would get rid of her ASAP.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> If it does not smell right, run!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_20> Mistake #1 - cheating on him.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> simply tell him u don't like him and if that doesn't work find a new guy
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> you need to work on your english... spellings and grammar.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> What the heck do 13 yearold guy's want?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> Girls like guys that act like jerks.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> i want to get to know her but what should i say?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> it might be infactuation, not love
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> What does it mean when a girl puts that she likes 'Boys!'
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> yeah porno stores most nimphs advertise what thay want hope ya size up.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_30> its like two for the price of one.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> it's perfectly fine, there's someone out there for you.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> I go for the beautiful face...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> AND IF DONT TELL HIM, YOU'LL NEVER KNOW IF HE WAS THE ONE.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> Seriously though, its gotta be quick.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> GOOD LUCK AND LET ME KNOW    ELIZA
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> So it will take the both of you...  Bless you both and best of all to you
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> and for his granny tell her to mind her own business!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> So guys growing up with a dad not showing them about chivalry.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> 'I'm going to go hang out with the boys.')
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> You don't want herpes, I'm pretty sure of that.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> having said that, i might not be so cavalier about it if i were a woman.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> do your duties in a perfect way rest will come to you, ok take care ,bye.....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> I also like playing games with her too.)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> AN UGLY  GIRL IS UGLY PERIOD.BUT A BEAUTIFUL GIRL,WITH EXTRA BAGGAGE CAN LOSS WEIGHT.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> !and how i will start with her?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Not relatives, someone whom you want t o pick their brain and ask what ever questions you desire.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Surfing P O R N, or mas tur bating, is a great way to relieve sexual stress.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> That might make it more useful for us who don't want to read through the kids stuff!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> this guy i met called me and i called him back but he didn't answer.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> in her purse, its the credit card
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> **** is a natural phenomena and it is a myth that **** is bad.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> foooooooooooooorget them u'll find them follow u
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> 2. for no one to be richer then the next guy  3. to end all wars
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> PS Divorce makes the money thing worse.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> a gift card nothing to personal
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Gee maybe he thinks passing notes is stupid?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Just put the situation like this... Would it bother you if your partner was doing what you are doing?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> If hes a cheater... hes a cheater!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> well if she is really hot then the answer is never....... ;)   only gay guys will ge annoyed....                                                ;)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> have peace in this if not anything else.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> He always wants sex ammm, you know,  Help Me
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> why worrie about it just call me
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> :-)  Relationships are like babies, they need a lot of care.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> Bang her mom, sister and best-friend.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> Have you ever been a victim of a bad/funny/or rediculous pick up line?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> Pull out a gun point it at him and laugh.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> if i told you... it wouldn't be secret.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> not me  not him ended up..both mad... any suggestions in how to get happy again?
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> if your not happy brake up.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> most of them will have their own chat there that they use.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> Tell him nicely to back the hell up.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> She just can't find a single solitary guy over there that likes her?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> If she considers it to be cheating, then it is cheating.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_10> WELL I DONT AGREE WITH ANYONE HERE!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> Or maybe she's just a sl*t.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> and dont go dutch but you can say lets go see a movie ill get tickets you get popcorn.
<NbChars_35> <LevSim_30> Um...wow,lmao.I guess they like to be around them,I really have no idea...wow.You've sen that?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> same reason women cheat on men.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_10> ANY WAY, ANYBODY THAT PLANS TO MARRY SHOULD CONSIDER WHAT THERE GETTING IN TO.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> unless you want an open sexuall relationship with her, get out now.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> He sounds a lil fruity to me....
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> he's heart broken, she says she's not ready for a relationship thats all
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> DIRTY WOMEN are as likely to cheat as DOGGISH MEN... Men just get caught more.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> but my friends don't want me to because they are scared that he will come kill them or something.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_10> DONT EVEN PAY THEM ANY ATTENTION AND BE YOU.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> Tell her to F**k of, just kidding.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_30> By all means ask him straight up if he is gay or bisexual.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> Anyone with self dignity would not go back to person who's like that.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> Just like anything else in life.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> Do things you wouldn't do before.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> the sirens only go off once every 2-3 years.
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_30> Anyway that sounds hot, I wouldn't drop her, but I don't know if I'd marry her.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> Have you tried kissing her yet?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> if the guy  hve  a  wife?
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_30> If not, then you just like him as a friend.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> It's just what I'm attracted to.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> for example there is a women a that we work in the same place,i am new there!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> But wit my baby its more of a mental thing!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> so good luck on what ever your decision may be.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Now, get out there and meet some women who area ladies and ain't slut_s!
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_30> if she cheated on him then she could just as easily cheat on you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Flowers are not cheap...depending on what kind you get.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> As for best friend... all my best friends are men and so am I and I'm straight (I think).
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> give her something about yourself the she can brag to her friends about
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_30> i did it to get closer to them, not for the sex or anything like that
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> how you gonna start a fight and get beat down.....LOL.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> why would he want to kill them is he like a murder
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> you need humor in your life to keep the relationship going.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> i think ur negative attitude is spoining ur time.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Ask yourself this, is she worth waiting for?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> trust ur self and be the king in ur sight
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> but even a little check like that would be worth $15.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Might be a little hard to find...but CHECK IT OUT!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> Just keep doing what your doing.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> this is how you avoid being creepy gym guy.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> if it bothers you much more, report it to people with more authority
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> i would want to stay friends, so no
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> reinforce that she is always right, no matter what the circumstance.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> the airport is a very public place with lots of security around.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> BUT IF HE STARTS THIS QUOTE GOD COMPLEX AGAIN,DROP HIM AND CONTINUE ON.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> 1 to 3 times a day.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> I stopped that by telling her if she don't like it stay your asss at home.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_20> How long does a quickie run?
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_10> I THOUGH THEY LOVE YOU A LONG TIME??
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> I let him go, it got kind of boring.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> well u have already posted your question and then too asking to us.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_30> u just have too see how he act i am one off then
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> (but make sure they feel the same way- otherwise you'll be kinda stalking them =))
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_15> hE COMES TO SEE ME VERY WEEKEND B/C WE ARE STILL YOUNG.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> I let him go, it got kind of boring.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> well u have already posted your question and then too asking to us.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> u just have too see how he act i am one off then
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> (but make sure they feel the same way- otherwise you'll be kinda stalking them =))
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> hE COMES TO SEE ME VERY WEEKEND B/C WE ARE STILL YOUNG.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> But let's be honest, does size matter?......
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Whatever you do do not cheat on him to get back at him.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> Better start saving these gals from ???
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Just be yourself, and have fun!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> YEAH BUT IF SHES A TEASE WELL DNT WHO WANTS TO DEAL WITH A TEASE
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> wow that is a good anticipation.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> short or none everywhere else...  it's my personal taste...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> TRY THE PHONE,AND DONT CALL FROM HOME OR WORK.GO SOMEWHERE HE WILL NOT FIND U.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> no matter how u tell him he is gonna hurt if he really love u like u said.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> If not think as its over and get over with your life.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> Not really a great option, eh?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> cant seem to get over this.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> i don't think ur boyfriend would like another man touching you.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> If it smells good it's go!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> He just might not be packaged the way YOU think!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> when it's totally bullcrap and the girl is totally innocent would you belive him.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> what would a woman do that would make u think forever?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_80> something like, will you go out with me?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> I don't know but I read it
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> if the boys cheat, then they are losers.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_15> DONT LET HER HURT YOU LIKE THAT
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> it potentialy could happen...and it sounds fun!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> I never got to tell him exactly how I felt.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Guess,  I know how yo feel.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> You could just approach her, tell her you've seen her here almost as often as you (!!!)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> be yourself...be nice kind...treat her like you want to be treated...it's easy once you get the hang of it....
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> (He might pick it up in a single ring!)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> u have something to lose both ways.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> because u didn't face the true love till now
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> all she cares about is spending time with you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> Never let em see ya sweat, at least this young.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> you got issues......go to a doctor, a psychiatrist!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> like i don't like to have fat bf or husband
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_50> match.com and if your jewish jdate.com
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> Women ( not men ) are the driving force in pressuring men to marry much less buy overpriced rings.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> (get a divorce/leave him first) Mistake #2 - calling him stupid.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_30> teenagers use the internet for homework plus it's winter break u know for christmas.
<NbChars_265> <LevSim_30> what about races of kid's grand-parents?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_20> they were boys (of course) lol
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> It looks like he is foaming at the mouth,(yuck) but I love him!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> !or have a detective organized u could be an detective tooo.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> by the rate ppl answer yer question, seems like all of us have read it.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> Then tell him your not going to shoot him , just break up with him.
<NbChars_275> <LevSim_25> I guess this just isn't the place for that.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> if she still goes all over him just let her know the peice of crap she is.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_35> but she will not want to fall in love with them.
<NbChars_320> <LevSim_20> I even feel like I sort of know you now even.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_30> Don't get in a serious relationship and just have fun.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> he's a 13 yearold guy what am I supposed to get him????
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_45> Dont go back just 2 go back cuz u love him!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> don't go out of your way looking for something or constantly hound him about it.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_10> WELL,FIRST FIND OUT WHY HER FIRST MARRAGE DINT WORK.WAS IT HER FAULT OR HIS.IF IT WAS HER FAULT!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> I have one thing 2 say, and one thing only.....HOMEWRECKER!!!!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> no you should not give up on a woman!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> tupac_lover_00@yahoo.com i am a girl and im single and looking e-mail me
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> of course hes cheating on you...are you on crack?
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> oh yeah btw we r both 12.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> He's and old man but hes only 20.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> But if it is a part time job you don't care about, then why not?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> And my buddy didn't kick my ass either because he was dating my sister.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> stop focusing on looks and quit looking altogether.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> tell him that and you will own him.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> SNAP OUT OF IT join the rest of the world.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> It was just what you envisioned.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> FIRST TRY TO BREAK UP WITH HIM BUT NOT IN PERSON.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> thats because most of them are pigs
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> people get married it is because they love each other very much.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> if you are lonely then you have friends that you can have fun with.
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_25> Then both of you can move on.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> considering there are only 49hrs left, most likely not.
<NbChars_275> <LevSim_25> where it can't really be anything more than jsut friends rofl
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_25> Of course, it does take two...
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_25> If he's not willing to try it then it's oretty much over...Sorry
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> Become rich, good looking, or famous.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> if you two are really meant to be, you will end up marrying him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> She looks like an awesome person to go out with, how do you ask her out?

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> But  just trust your heart and what it says.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> or they think that by telling you that it will turn you on.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_30> try to ask him with indirect way then trust ur self by doing the first step
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_25> Talk,get to know him and finaly ask him on a date!!
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_25> You seem like a sweet guy who only wants happiness.
<NbChars_280> <LevSim_25> Not if you were a smart cheater!
<NbChars_260> <LevSim_25> My boyfriend never gets me anything.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> and u dont want that now do u.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> Keep it all the way real!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> take your bucket of worms and just go fish in another pond.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Some are because they have issues with men I am assuming.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> that is just wrong plus shes older.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> well technically you have not penetrated so no.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Tell him you now a lesbian.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> if you want act sexy around him.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> and if he says NO, kick him in the crotch anyways.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> I ALWAYS KNEW THAT SOME WOMAN ARE SMARTER THAN MEN!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> You are just gettting surounded by a lot of jerks!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> You better keep your eyes open or Joe next store might steel your man...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> If a girl fancies a guy she rubs or touches her neck frequently.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_20> I could go on and on.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> if you ponder this question more then twice in your life you r probably gay
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> Tell them you want to have sex with another, then your not cheating your truthing!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> I get dumped for guys that won't do anything for a woman.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> maybe because you havent found the right guy to respect you
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> I'm still in love with my ex eventhough she's a dirty biatch......
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> buy a car and go where the wind takes you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Explain exactly what you want and what is going on.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> *also very easy 2 get drunk*
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> u just keep silent like u dont knows she is existing
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> Any just don't replace cologne with soap
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I dont think you should be worried.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> Man are you gonna be sick.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> and it won't cost you a dime.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> I already messed up (bawled at a dance), and my mind was already screwed up for two weeks.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> you get to watch two fully naked woman having sex instead of one which is always good.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> I have the same problem so if you get a good answer let me know uzedkarz2002@yahoo.com.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> is he old and yer young?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> Hope everything works out great for you!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> i wouldn't try to find the right woman (guy in my case) becuase it'll just happen when it happens
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> It's just one of things you know...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> and if its going to be a problem then just dont talk to him anymore.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> then pray to you favorite deity.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> it's tough... but you have to find it in yourself to go on.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> LOVE LEADS TO SEX ....   sex without love is like having sex with an animal !
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> the key is to show that you are different!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> LOVE YOURSELF AND DONT LET ANY MAN PUT U DOWN   ELIZA
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> It is a  cool thing to do!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> go up and start talking to her
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_30> 1st, that you both know, 2nd, she MAY know, and then third question you know she doesnt know.
<NbChars_260> <LevSim_25> If you really care about her, you will want her to be happy.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> He should not cheat on you and he should not care about your weight at all.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> and thought you should just introduce yourself!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> just tell your family to give her a chance you love her thats all that matters right
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> and he can't just kick you out anyway?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> I don't think he is totally straight if he enjoys watching stuff like that.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> pray about it and you will get your answer,watch
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> ;-)   Anyway,  lower back pain is a terrible thing.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_40> ask her out if she says no try to move on
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> I have recurring dreams of my ex almost weekly.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> I've known love from friends, guys, my moms,n family.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> then when you feel the time is right ask her out
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> Then one day the guy turns everything around and says he loves me?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> I waited until I was thirty, and guess what?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> Make if funny if she says no, and i asure you shell end up saying yes.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> and when they ask you if their ugly so no, tell them they are beautiful or something lol.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> There's like 20 million women right here!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Hi, I agree....there's sure a lot of youngin's on this thing!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> That means that u are on his mind all the time.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> yet every once in awhile i will get like a crush on another guy.usually someone im around alot.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> so try to do the second thing first, then if you can't do that first thing.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> everytime your with her (almost all the time) shell be happy or smiling.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_20> LOVE IS REALLY ALL THAT MATTERS.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> Just tell, her that you wanna take her just as friends and no pun intended.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> Ask ur wife to get on a webcam.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> Hope you're in that same boat.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Becareful in who you fall in love with!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> do u love this person deeply?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> But they DO things that say 'I fancy you'.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> try to get him/her out of your head.

<NbChars_160> <LevSim_20> Old but this is a golden saying!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> he probably isn't cheating on you.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> gay clubs or church but not both at the same time :)
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> Tell her she looks nice and that you love her.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_20> Yes, but not freaked out... okay, maybe a little.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> Al Pacino did why can't you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> I am 21 and I have only had sex with 2 people!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> but seriously i dont know what i would prefer
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Hey that is how I feel.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> then just tell him you dont like him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> you can not have your cake and eat it too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Shall I call her back ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> they should just cuddle infront of an movie or fireplace, relax it works for me

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> I never heard from him again until christmas day nearly 2 years later i learned that he had died.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> When we guys say we like u, it means that u r one of the 10 girls we like.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> otherwise y would b want to b alive, if we're alone?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> Your reward will come, just hang in there...

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> I don't know if he has girlfriend or what.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> and leaves plenty of opportunities to get close to one another, and talk!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> Well there you go clash said everything I was going to say lol
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> DOES YOUR HEAT SKIP A BEAT WHEN YOU SEE THIS PERSON?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> guyz that cheat are secretly gay
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> If not then you should ask him if he likes the company u keep..
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Find someone who really cares for you - someone is out there!

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> U had answred my Q: What a gul expect fr a boy when she get married?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> you can't make someone like you just because... you want to.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> I never really have, although truth be told I always really wanted one!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> but i prefer older or the same age as me.
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_25> She's an I-MaC and your A PC ...get my drift
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> 2) Get out and meet some girls.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> It wouldn't hurt to dress nice and fix your hair!!

<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> pep rally at high school 15 years later we are still together

<NbChars_150> <LevSim_15> I'M SERIOUS AFRICAN ARABIC MAN I WISH TO GET SERIOUS WOMEN TO MARRIGE
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> because guys like boobs and the internet is the easiest place to find them.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> That depends on how old u r and where u want him 2 kiss u ?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> And, of course, it always helps to have someone nice to start dating :)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> no just cause hes good to your son does not mean hes good for you and to you
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> If you are not, you are just using him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Personally I wouldn't worry about it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> Perhaps because many do not believe that they can.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> I would not trade this man for anything I AM the luckiest woman on earth...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> classmates.com helped me find a few
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> if you dont send it thats fine but putting things down allows you to think it through first.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> there is something they don't get at home.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> You dont Just get her to give it time Dog.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> it does not matter if two guys or gurls care about each.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> But if he just responsed bcos he's a polite man then it is ok, dont think too much.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> introduce him to another girl, preferably one that 'likes' him, and then encourage their relationship to bloom.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> if i was you i wouldn't do it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Either he loves your or he doesn't.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> Especially if you dont want to have sex.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> IT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW YOU FEEL WHEN IT'S ALL OVER
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Get his s/n....and send him messages every once in a while.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> don't be cheap in first sight.....
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Or what are you doing now that you were not doing then.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> DO YOU GET BUTTERFLIES IN YOUR STOMACH EVERYTIME THE PERSON CALLS?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> it seams you love him already so tell him according your heart voice.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> mayb ur personality is off beat.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> You have not said whether you are M or F.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> not according to the bible;  otherwise i dont know
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> See how it helps to give...?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> depends what there and your dateing history is.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> If a certain subject always ends up w/ u closer physically they're playing u for a fool.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Shes the type of girl who is not good or doesn't even express how she feels.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> I mean the list goes on and on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I don't know but tell me when you find out
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> i thought he is looking for someone.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> NOT AS LONG AS YOUR HAPPY AND YOU ARE DOING/GETING WHAT YOU WANT:)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> But things that obviously bother her, I've stopped doing, and now she rarely gets jealous.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> I tried it once but he immediately knew that was me :)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I asked a guy out and he said we would...sometime.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> Is it just a want or is it really a NEED?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> He does so much stuff 4 me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> if your husband or wife is cheating or hurting you are you suppose to just say with them?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> I will tell you this though,..
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> e)It was like my body exploded!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> any chat pro has such rooms
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> Women don't pay but men gladly do (enough to make it economically worthwhile at least)..
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> I want to smile and enjoy every minute..even during sad times...we'll keep our 'wits.'
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> I just want to know what you guys think of this.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> GUYS: Would u consider buying your girl a ring with her birthstone or opt for a traditional diamond?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> But I confess that the whole blog thing baffles me...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> (i really hate smoking -- of any sort, and drinking)
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> if u dont wanna marry the guy let him go dont play with him.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> the guys are notthe only ones that cheat.but people cheat because they are not happy.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> girls get serious about it as long as they know ur serious.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> i ask myself the same shit
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> Find some friends to hang out with and get her off your mind.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> Nothing fancy ..Eat with your fingers kind of food...it's more fun
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> first of all why do you call yourself darkangle?
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_55> is there a problem with me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> front row  at  a concert (love  gun  by  kiss  has  a different  meaning  for  me )
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Why do men do this you ask?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> You love him and he loves you.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> yes   2 years is no big deal
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> Angel honey give his ass the boot
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_10> BUT AGAIN I SAY DO NOT DO IT WAIT FOR MARRIAGE!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> so nod and say ur right honey i never thought of it like that.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> she calls you back when you call her (5).
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> But I want nice guys not complete jerks.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Even the perfect man, is not so perfect.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> depends on wether ur choosin' the good guys or the player type.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> best said in the movie old school Love its a mother fucker
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> She won't dare want to be with another if it is!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> not all women think like this, just your woman.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> no i won't, but somebody will...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> someone i could look at forever...
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> And she should love you for that.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Bring it up like in bed during pillow time with each other
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> He would make us all look really bad ;)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I stopped that quick but he tells me not to worry and he stopped telling her he loved her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> No because your parents care about and don't want anything bad to happen to you
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> really, for better or worse was your vow.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> He says i have bussniess trips everywhere lately.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> WHY DO YOU NEED A MAN TO SPOIL YOU?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> If he does, give it a try...go for it!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> it's just asking to get hurt!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> does he tell other ppl when your not around?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> ummm...what time of year is it?...do think he is SHOPPING???
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> i really like this guy, but i am trying to get over it and be a friend.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> if he please to do all that it would without asking
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> it is natures free gift to all kind.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> she shares her lunch (food) with you (9).
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> yup absoloutely ok as long as ya look carefully
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> But the truth is: I WANT ONE!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> His excuse was that she was like his sister.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> If you are a guy:  You are setting yourself up for failure.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_40> as long as they are over 18.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> guys don't like drama, and stuff like that.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> the kid that they all ready have.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> I LOVE HIM FOR JUST BEING HIMSELF.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> and is it possible that he realy loves me?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> theyn will always defend you no matter what.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> Good luck and congrats on the 2 years
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> My boyfriend did stuff like that all the time.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> If we guys could have MULTIPLE!

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> trouble related to love n relationship...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> introducing bride and groom, cake cutting, dinner time, dances, etc.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i have the same problem with my mom right now but we are getting there.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Marriage is for life my friend!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> YES, IT DOES IF ITS A GUY LIKE ME WITH A THICK 10INCH PENIS!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> stay offline for goodness sake, if you think like that.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> I  can't seem to just have a boyfriend I right away fall in love and scare them away
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> I DON'T WANT TO LOSE THE BEST FRIEND I EVER HAD!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> is to let them get it out, while you JUST LISTEN.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> this is because LOVE IS BLIND.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> No, this is NOT a joke!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> a couple of tattoos are ok. certain peircings are hot.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> I don't ever wish he would buy me flowers.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> stop trying to get a date online & get off the computer!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Take out the trash, pick up your underwear, and say I LOVE YOU at least twice per day.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> with a cucumber..and a shaving cream can
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> hand her you american express card
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> I think is to cut off the shit of getting hurt!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> one with a hot body and a hot personality.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> JUST CHICK HIM OUT..LIKE TRY TO HAVE HIS SCHEDULE.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> Thats gettin kinda thin ice right there, with the touching.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> He will probably go back there.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> just be nice to him when you are telling him off.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Someone who is smart and funny.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> It's just going to make them mad.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> You CAN'T get a guy to like you, you don't have to.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Just dont hang out with them.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> If you banged her mom or sister, you're not getting her back.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> i don't know about girls in general, but i know i do.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> So eather way, you shouldn't worry about it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Because your boyfriend won't let you have one.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> its you he should think is sexy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> TRY TO DO THINGS THAT WILL TAKE YOU'RE MIND OFF HIM.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> it isn't just your perfection you have to cope with, its everybody elses).
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> But it's the normal looking people you should worry about.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> seems kinda like a dumb question... if she didn't like you why would she let you kiss her?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> Can't live ur life to please others.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> I really like the guy, i would do anything for him just to be happy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Because if girls don't feel an emotional connection with their lover, IT AINT HAPPENIN-- at all.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> So you want one and don't want one?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> IF HE WANT TO KEEP IT QUIET, IF SO NO HIS A-- IS UP TO NO GOOD.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> i only have one friend thats a girl and ppl tell me thats not normal.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> Any way if you truly love him you should trust him no matter what.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> if they dont and be honest with u  u wont be able to take it
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> I beleive in Lust at first sight but love???
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> it actually depends on the girl.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> you should always be who you are.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> if your not comfortable with that then joke around(example) say wouldnt that be weird if we went out?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> its like working out how do you get stronger?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> life is a mix of good and bad, but it's not always 50/50.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Turn  on BC GRANT RD - go 1.0 mi  11.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Then tell her that just because you are apart that you can't still be friends.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> And NEVER do anything you dont feel comfortable with.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> yes.Try to bring a girl to orgasm.She wont leave you
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Then, it's up to the guy to if he wants to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> If you have to ask...he doesn't..!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> cuz maybe you're a good kisser and u don't kno it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Anywhere the 2 of you want to.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> if so he probly feels obligated.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> How can I break up with him like that and he just spend $108 on my b-day gift?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> get married.... no wait, then you'll never get laid!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> If you're not married Break it off.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> My thinking is that if you wonder if you are in love, you are not.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> ill go to the first one!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> spend more time with your wife.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> love may be considered as first step to have sex  ...but there is also pure love without  sex
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> Don't do it no matter what she says!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> No you stab at what you can get close to    Then you move in !!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> If life puts you down 7 times get up 8 times!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> GOOD GIRLS WHO WANNA TRY SOMETHING NEW, LIKE LIVE ON THE WILD SIDE, GO FOR SO CALLED BAD BOYS!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> yes this is normal..even some girls look at sexy girls too (but not all)
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_45> just on days that end in Y
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_50> And wants a family with me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> DO GET ANXIOUS WHEN YOU DON'T SEE THIS PERSON EVEN IF IT'S JUST FOR A DAY?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA ON ANY DAY!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Sure he'd find it weird but that doesn't mean it wouldn't have a positive outcome.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> What type of party did u throw and does he like parties?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> i  think  she  is tellin  you  to  smack dat  ass
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> every guy has a different fedish, some like ginger some like marry ann.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> he probably feels like he needs some space, and asking him where he is going may make it worse.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> you`ll only get hurt in the end.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Up to you but if I had it to do over I wouldn't.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> I take it that you are trying to see if he would cheat on you..
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> I JUST DON'T THINK THERES HOPE.....
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> Maybe Phone-Sex with each other !!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Example: If your a shy male,it would be hard for you to ask some out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> Let her know just how much she really does mean to you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> my famile was cool with it, but i know there some familes that are not.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> YES I HAVE AND IT WAS WORTH IT I FOUND A BETTER NEW PERSON THAT LOVES ME MORE
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> Whatever you do, do your best!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> but other wise i agree with you completely.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> try one with a special room or the empty side or outside.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> I'm not being gross, do you see what I mean?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> If it's warm enough find a lake that rents paddleboats (they're like 5 bucks an hour) and paddle around.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_50> Report Abuse   Why do i want him back so bad?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> Next get out there and have fun again...mingle discover new things...most important don't pretend and definitely laugh.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> IF HE LOVES YOU THEN HE WILL WAIT FOR YOU!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> that he is really not ready for you, and don't get hung up on him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> since she now has lost her vagina and has a penis, you'd have to look elsewhere.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> break up with your parthern if it is your bf or just forget aout it and go on
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> i already gave him a nice card for xmas.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> Just think a man that does all this and you're stil not happy?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> Love the LORD JESUS CHRIST First .... then  HE will give you the best!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> going somewhere that has a pool table!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> You've never even seen a pic of her???
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I just checked and they have versions of the song by
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> health or sickness, rich or poor, better or worse.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> You know the old saying goes boys only want one thing so just wait.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> If he's a nice guy then maybe things will work out this time!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> no, it's not bad at all.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> hello mate urs is the same problem as mine!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> only you can answer that question but it is not legal in some places
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> he says it bothers him too that guys leave me comments.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Well, I'm a young teen and I definatally do like girls that speak their mind.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> no, it's not bad at all.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> hello mate urs is the same problem as mine!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> only you can answer that question but it is not legal in some places
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> he says it bothers him too that guys leave me comments.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Well, I'm a young teen and I definatally do like girls that speak their mind.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> Being 'In Love' with someone does.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> What if they wanted to wait for marriage?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> My mom always said, Actions speak louder than words.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> If you have to ask if it is LOVE then you don't have it, yet.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> My girlfriend used to get jealous fairly often...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> No if u dont want the kid use a condem
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> maybe you need to anser that question.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> Say something creative like Hi, I am Joe Blow, how are you??
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> picture yourself telling someone that you love them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> But, REMEMBER, her ex was NOT a good man either...he cheated on her.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> ask him if he likes guys
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> to me if a guy is shy a note showing intrist would be a good way to start.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> My boyfriend does a lot of things that I don't approve of.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> then tell them thay let you know.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> if she thinks the guy is mature then she will admit she likes him.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_40> I like one guy, I never talk to him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> all guys think about sex all the time.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_50> this is why devorce is so high.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> Hey, do you want to be my boyfriend?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Love is always free ......... and what is not free cannot be love(true love).
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> I like one guy, I never talk to him.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> all guys think about sex all the time.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> this is why devorce is so high.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> Hey, do you want to be my boyfriend?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Love is always free ......... and what is not free cannot be love(true love).
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> was he like this before you married him?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Heck what will you do in your free time...LOL
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Depends on the weather and where you live...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> well when someone loves you they look for you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> If you meet a guy and have been hanging out for over month.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> please send any help info that is available.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> What so if she also loves u.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_20> Whatever you do, don't let her go.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> where can you get the wedding of your dreams donated, in whole or peices, without the media stuff?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> if you are in love, your life's going to be hell!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> You made a promise, doesn't that mean anything???
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> well you should talk to that persons best friend.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> and its not this dick with legs.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> would you love that person any less if that happened?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> i dont won't to be nosisy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> But oh it was so much fun getting there, lol.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> when you talk about other girls she gets mad (6).
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> i dont won't to be nosisy.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> But oh it was so much fun getting there, lol.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> My room, so I can watch.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> when you talk about other girls she gets mad (6).
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> because it is a big deal to you.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> then once you guys have started talking about the topic ask her if you would ever have a chance.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> cause they love to have sex with someone new
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> It cuts both ways, I think.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> When you don't like something do you say that it is gay?
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_30> Go out with somone else without telling anyone.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_30> (short answer... ask him what he likes!)
<NbChars_365> <LevSim_25> I know my bf cares 4 me.
<NbChars_375> <LevSim_20> I know its the good ol' USA.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> you guys flirt together(example tickling, play fighting, chasing eachother) (7).
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> when your ugly what do you have to lose.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Whey people don't like african girls?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> You gotta feel out the situation though.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Man I totally sympathize with you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Guys don't play games like you women.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> but he's married, with three kids.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> its hard but that will make you slip up and he will know.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> im a women and i don't get it either
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> is it good to remain virgin for a boy till marriage?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> tell him that u two can just be friends and maybe something will happen later
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> that should take all the stess off of you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Best place to find a Date ........College  Best place to take someone on a Date Deffenetly not a club!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Just check the size of his balls honey....flat out say their looking smaller and watch his responce baby!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> but just have a sence of style and hygene and you'll attract a guy
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> u just need to ask her frequently about what she feels for u !
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> easy just tell them or show dem how much u love dem
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> if he loves you he is gonna change his stupid crap.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> At least that is what I find and I'm sure an average guy.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> somehow i agree with them , because the nature gives her the role of feeding and protcting !
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_20> IF U WILL NOT DO IT SOMEONE SHOULD.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> go to google and tipe in ecard then u can take it from there.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> So how can I show her I care about her feelings?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> Men do not like a weak woman.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Maybe you just have too many trixies in your life.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> I know plenty of guys who don't like skinny women, i thihnk its just personal taste.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_55> they can but it's not likely.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> Don't think of it as spying....
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> He was what I breath and thought about 24/7.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> if you want a life partner ther it matter.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> spends less time with you always has an excuse to everything
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> on top of a 100 ft crane in a gravel pit during a storm... YAHOOOOOOOO
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Then if they say maybe or yes ask her to do something.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> does anyone know how i can talk my friend to stop stalking people he falls in love with ??
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Obviously, if you're cheating on him, then you don't truly love him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> But I gotta admit it does seem stupid as I look back.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Someone who is not bitchy or conceited.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Go out to a club and ask some girls.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> She could have a great mind but if she looks like a monkey then it just won't work out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> helllll naw....does he have a brother?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> if you want a pertner to eat panipuri then it not.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> i know it's corny but it's romantic.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Now you know what he's *really* like.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> sex) he knows exactly what to say to get what he wants.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> I Hopefully I helped you a little.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> you take your wife for a reason right?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> Ask him if he wants to be your boyfriend.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> !no, i don't think its cuz ur a libra, cuz, i'm a sagitarious and i do have prob.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> I mean it will be her ring so she should like it.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> if he really likes he'll understand what you want too do.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> But never push and worry and distress.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I dont care if they are popular.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> (that may not be the best choice though)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> no, you'd have been a prick had u said yes!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> If it floats your boat go ahead.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> opening doors is sweet but that cant run low.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> You don't need friends to get yourself a girl.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> because your getting old and they want u to be happy.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> Girl, I've been there done that!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Surprise him once he comes home and take a wiff...
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> it means he is a real jerk
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> (Butterflies in the stomach... know what I mean?)
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_15> wELL IF YOU ASK MY TRUE THOUGHTS nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnoOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> if you dont you wont be together forever for sure.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> IT DEPENDS IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> If you get some too (it doesn't mean you're crazy)  you will understand why she is like she is.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> When you tell her you love her and you know without a doubt she loves you back!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> Yeah, keep your mouth shut and leave this situation.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_35> I say wait till your in your 30's.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_10> YOU GO TO  HER.ITS VERYY SIMPLE
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> Jerk is only one of the items that make some men.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> The one thing I've learned is don't force life.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_40> yes it is a sin and it is illegal!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> i`m not giving her any attention and she calms down herself
<NbChars_275> <LevSim_20> lol Just cuddle up behind her.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_25> Guys look for a girl that is not retarded and looks pretty good.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_10> I LEAVE NOTES TO TELL HER BUT SOMEONE WRITES BACK i DONT THINK ITS HER.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_25> Because they are just soooooo darn sexy!!!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_30> relax... lots of woman have this problem.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> ithink long hair makes guys look dirty and like girls
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> Unless you have alot of money then it might be 46.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> Trust fund, yuppies, preppy girls all hang out in uptown.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> 90% of women do not orgasm by penetration alone.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> If your man is cheating on you need to kick him to the curb RIGHT NOW!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> My boy you asked a very good question!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> #2 do u enjoy the doormat position?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Did you ask her why she did that?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> never fight a man who is not afraid to die, he has nothing to lose and everything to gain.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> if he is not eating, he if flirting.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> suck it up talk to her and ask her out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> would you mind if you were/are married for your husband to have coffee with a married woman?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Sorry that it didn't work out.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> a boy in my school and i have his pic and #.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> A lot of people say yahoo chat.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> you should ask her of she does or doesn't like ur last name and then take it from there!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Ask your girlfriend because she obviously knows them best.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> What, I'm trying to figure out is, is she playing with me or for real?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> But i think it effect only if you want a LIFE PARTNER .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> the only reason a person askes this question would to try and get some there selves.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> not very expensive and you get a lot for your money
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> don't believe anything you see in a movie.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> Don't do it ...  oh my God you will so regret it.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> Baby Girl: A first love is a tough one.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> how would you like it if she slept with one of your friends, right?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> Ok, the last part may be overboard... :)
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_25> Am I being stupid or what?
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_30> n am not crazy at all.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> thats why they say better or worse, not better or nothing.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> Turn  on MANCHESTER EXPY - go 1.4 mi  4.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> try talking to him on the phone when he aint around his friends or just ask him in person
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Don't u have needs other than that.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Even thought they might not want a relationship; they figure they have a greater chance of getting some action
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> and go about your business like it was nothing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> i think you shouldn't, regardless of her age, both of you will regret it later.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> You were not a prick, you were a gentleman!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_10> NEXT TIME HE GOES ON A BUSINESS TRIP GO ALONG!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Flirt a little and ask her to go to the movies!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> tell her you won't listen to her because she isn't treating you with respect.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> yes, let him think he is macho.even if he isn't.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> my friend told me he love me to but i dont know what to do
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> maybe both her birthstone and yours!
<NbChars_365> <LevSim_25> only i kno that he doesnt love me.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> Most women don't want guys who are afraid of them, they want confident men.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_35> You just said that he likes someone else.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> i have said this already in many diffirent but similar ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> the new man in my life is great too, i don't know what my heart tells me anymore.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Good luck in finding your soul mate :)
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> Usually there not mad at u , she may be deppressed.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> i don't know either;  it's like saying i'm throwing up when really it all goes down, not up
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> go to ebay...my friend's mom buys them on there all the time...you can get anything on ebay.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> yes i'll do if i felt her need it .... satisfy her aften and she will enjoy u
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> tell him to stop chatting online so much and start working out.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> find someone who is willing :)  then ask
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> do whatever comes from ur heart
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> if u two have a strong enough relationship outside of dating that is
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> I think that he is seeing another girl, but he is HOT!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> But I don't despair that much.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> I'm guessing that she's around 50?
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_20> Be Honest, smilling, funny and gentleman ...
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> cherish true friends and love your boyfriend!
<NbChars_250> <LevSim_30> when she asks you to do something and you do it w/out complaining.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> I only wish they were, then I would go after hime like a cat in heat!
<NbChars_300> <LevSim_25> So it is not just the guys.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_40> its mean the one who needs it ,ie getting bored by the relationship
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_25> if he finds out uve been with another guy, he'll leave ur ass so fast ur head will spin
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> not my husband..but maybe someone elses.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_40> he was fair and honest and didnt lead you on.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> Be jerk back, and don't like him anymore!!!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> You do know what a Houdini is, don't you?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> if may seem that your using it to your benift.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Good Luck and go get em.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> in family meeting i see her and i like her from the first look
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> You just have to STOP...no one can do it for you.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> Dude, there are plenty - PLENTY of other girls out there.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I have, on more than one occasion...and I'm a dude!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> I don't have that specific kind of fetish, exactly...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Another guy would not happen, lol.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Should I try and talk 2 him again?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> they say that sex for woman , means family , love , safty !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Dont be afraid of embarassing your self.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> d)I felt my whole body shake uncontrollably!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> cheating is a fact opf life most women who blame men with cheating are the women who cheat
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> they want to fire down the sexual instinct
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> Admit all wrongs (even though you are not at fault).
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> Maybe she is not a girl?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> please send any help info that is available.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> its never too good to b either one of these.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> if someone else is happy he will be happy.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> Do whatever it takes to stay close emotionally!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> she likes u...but she seems kinda immature.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> but now i dont and he still likes me.... what do i do to not hurt him?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> Whats the worst she could say?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> as your exchanging phone numbers with her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> smile :) its the 2nd best thing you can do with your lips.........1st being kissing, of course
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Ever heard the saying women need a reason guys just need a place?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> !if he's looking at the net he's not looking at you anymore you should ask is that normal
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> IS THIS PERSON THE FIRST THING ON YOUR MIND WHEN YOU WAKE IN THE MORNING?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> well i say u should still be friends but dont stay with him for a long time
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> if things were meant to be they will fall into there place.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> it all depends on how turned on you are as to how wet you get
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> My mom chose a younger guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> You shouldn't trust him if he's in a different area code.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> But Im not sure what Im doing wrong.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> WE BUY EACH OTHER STUFF AND LEAVE IT THERE UNTIL WE FIND IT.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> you can still be his friend.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> ok. Im not sure what u r talking about but my nick here is my email.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> instead of agreeing you should be exicted.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> try showing some signs of liking/attention, maybe he'll go for you or<(of course) maybe he wont!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> You don't really ever get over it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> there's alot more ways, but i gotta go.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> umm its someone u can be in the same room with for more than 10 min.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_45> if so then id bet yes.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> I just knew, not like that childish knew, but really knew..
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> Be shy, but speak ur mind wen u feel u should.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> One of the most awesome guys I know has CP.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> do you really want someone around you have to keep proving yourself to?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> well i dont know what to tell u but there is a website below 4 u to try out
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Nope, as long as you do it back.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> you have to ask your self do i deserve better than this.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> tell them how you feel about them
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Don't give him a reason not to.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Well as a woman I would wonder what is wrong with a guy who didn't like sex.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> Asian girls are like other girls.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> no just kidding just dont answer it if you don't need to
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> Maybe u will even get one 4 Christmas!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> Maybe thats why they come here....
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> That way you last longer :P
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> I know someone who is looking for work...Thanks!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> Course I wouldn't date him cus he's like 30 years older than me, but yeah...
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> I mean look around outside it's everywhere
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> i really dont like to babysit on my days off!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> If their is no reson for you wanting to leave!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> to love & to be loved is the  greatest thing on this earth
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> You could always put the plane tickets in a huge box and wrap it ;)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> Just dress really hot & go dancing at a night club with just your girl-friends.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> Maybe they are not looking for a wife.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> When you find the one that you just can't live without, her looks aren't going to matter.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> ofcourse they are human too they are just into the same sex.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> If your guy is cheating on you and you know it then break up with him.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> If he says yes, you know.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> because he dont like you, hes gay
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Why do guys say they NEED sex?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> Or think of it like this.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Don't try to be mean, be yourself.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> have a 1st date at a cafe (lunch or coffee).
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> do you want to hang out sometime?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> Just take your time because you have lots of it.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> I just love a squirty lady!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> and if you love him so much what are you doing out with his cousins?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> BUT IT'S GOOD TO KNOW WHAT THE GIRLS LIKE:)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Ya I am interested in this question too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> the woman who is now my wife.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> I don't really want a relationship.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> dont rush a kiss, the best 1s take time, trust me(bad experience).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Why can't your dad be friends with JEN?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> personaly i dont know what to say when my bf complements me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> try to remeber why you got married in the first place.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> I haven't been able to see her cuz, shes in NY and I'm in TN.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> BE NICE, CONCERNED AND KEEP YOUR MIND ON SCHOOL AND FRIENDS.
<NbChars_265> <LevSim_25> ha ha, guys don't always wanna have sex.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> go ahead and have sex- but use a condom.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> I like geeks...they make more money and try harder (in all areas)
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> or he's telling you this to get in your panties if he hasn't already done so.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> i would not try to talk to him anymore, it sounds like he just wanted to have sex
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> But once u start living together u tend 2 see ur partner often so gradually that LOVE declines
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Try sitting her down, and try to talk about it with her*
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Well if he is a friend you should be able to just ask him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> try to send her a love letter that expresses exactly how you feel about her?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> HOW DO I KNOW ITS HER?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> have you seen the movie A lot Like Love?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> at a consert or any where where you need a lot of money
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> it just sounds like you're entering the friend's stage man...you dont want that do you?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> i think a restrant would be great
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> But, I never saw my cousin again!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> Oh, and one more thing:  don't ignore other guys while you're waiting for him to come around!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Ask him about it, If you thin he is lying, give him an ultimatum.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> i don't think so if you like her then go out with her just with her dad's permission
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> Because mature woman are good companion.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Why not, its not like there is a 30 year difference, then it wouldn't be very smart.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> A VERY CARING PERSON, WILL HELP ANYONE IF I CAN, BUT DON'T HURT THE PEOPLE I LOVE.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> if he truly loves u he wont leave u!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Just what should he say ?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> I'll just put it in a simple example...  MEN - 2 kinds of orgasms       a) Off the chain!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> put your kids first every time
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> if u like my advice e-mail me at tech_boy001@yahoo.com
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> When you get married to them and you stay married until one or both of you dies.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Anyway... there are alot of girls out there, and we are all looking for different stuff in a guy.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> im going there something like this now.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> And what's not to be attracted to by that?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> say that men like womens breast because when we started walking upright, it started to resemble the butt.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> I know that there is nothing fair in Love and War ... but she is being ridiculous!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> make friends with him/her and ask them out
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_10> Listen to DONALD D.........HE SOUNDS LIKE HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Soon u will find the right guy.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_10> AND IT WILL KNOCK YOU OFF YOUR FEET.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> AND THEN BE A GOOD LIS-NER...
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> He might he that as fun.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> just hang out with him and if hes nice 2 u or is staring at u he likes u
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> If not you just made her remember why she loves you in the first place.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> it's not worth loseing a best friend over.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> my husband is working in new jersey right now but ppl said hes married?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> You see...She tells me she loves me.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> I think some how some guys  are so week and aimless
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> Hmmm....I don't usually recommend asking right out.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> spill a smoothie on his shoes..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Maybe she's in love with it.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> So there really isn't any clear cut way of knowing.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> she say very little just wondering why?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> Love is love ... Live and let live.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> i dont know why so it scares me.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> even so its no good Men are always(almost) like that.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> i would rather he had some meat on dem bones.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> because you have to ask a question to get the answer!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> im in the same pickle tell me the awnser
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> if you or they have ever cheated on somewon dont bother.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> find out if this guy still like you or not and then hook up with me at jellybreadkeisahhly@yahoo
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> Thanks for the comment on my question Poohjo :D  Love your enthusiasm also  ;)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> if she smiles and hangs out with you you have only moved up.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> if you truly love this person you will wait forever.. how ever long she/he wants you too..
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> they always want to be with you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> if    he really loves u then 'i love u' doesn't matter .
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> I think in most guys it is just a want.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> No, b'cos that is what your heart desires
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> I fall in love with my husband again and again!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> I even returned to the church begging god to give my wife back to me.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> why r'nt u happy for u?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_20> pair of kids, so its all good
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> On your wedding day you'll be so thankfull you waited and say WOW!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Just say your right to everything she says
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> AND BREAK DOWN THE WALL AND MAKE HIM FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH BEING NEAR YOU ..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Its like there addicited to it!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Otherwise......life just isn't worth it...no matter how hard I work at it.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Second, just tell him you don't want to hang out with him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> oh you never should just agree a relationship, deep down you don't want it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> If we are crazy...so be it!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> sorry but it is not your job.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> I do and the more you speak your mind the more guys (like me) goes crazy
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> figure out if you are still in love with him, if youre not, try to get there again.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> Holy crap... you've got to be kidding me.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> i would dump him and find some one that really love you
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> WEll Im a girl so maybe i know your answer.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> but always keep yo eye open holla!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> Do you think he really loves me :)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> im going out w/  my bestfriend (guy) and we bearly started.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> Sure,but don' be discouraged.It happens to evreyone once in a while,just put it back in.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> You don't want a man, you want a servant.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> We argue alot about stupid stuff, but he treats my son like gold.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> but in true love the concept is different and they will smile....and the go uhhhh!!!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> sit down and give him a good talking to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Now that said lets talk about the guy who left to think.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> its like the air we breath.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> just like throwing up it has to come up your throat to be able to go down!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> sure you will someday, when you are married.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> someone you met at a bar - at least you know what he looks like
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> or blonds red heads lol  sorry
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> I know it depends on the woman!!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> anything above two and half inch rocks!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> Even if he does leave his wife and kids.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> dump her ass if she is arrogant like that.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> lust is when you are first with someone.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> You want to be just friends too.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> however, he is married and with a kid (she knows, kid doesn't).
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> (**  )<| Dead Fish Ollec, the Fish Slayer
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Don't try to force yourself to like someone.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> tell him to adopt a child for him self(i mean it in all honesty!)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> How men get rid of clamydia?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> Not one parent and a child.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> Ask alot of Q's but also know when to keep your mouth shut and listen.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Ask just 2 people - her Father and your Boss.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> what should i give him for xmas?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> And, you can also ask her out.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> your soulmate could be in europe.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> I love peach fuzz on women.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> (I hope I got that right)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> IF NOT, STICK WITH YOUR PLANS.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> I know a lot of people who are on their 2nd marriages that do that.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> Soooo....yeah.......my little emotional overflow session here....lol.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If you don't like it, then it IS wrong.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> So whats another way to know if she likes me or not?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> Say your guy loves you first.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> not often enough, too many other things going on.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> I havn't had one yet,but I think just sit someplace and have your best bud perfrom
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> just have s3x a few, times, get married, then have sextuplets(6)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> should i call him or what?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> Don't degrade yourself this way...there are tons of sexy nice guys out there.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> Only when we're not thinking about sex...oops!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> when you are in a relationship and you are seriouse about it
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> the wedding/ marriage isn't just about her.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> But man........that is too young to know what you want from a partner for life!!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Act like your name Triple H
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_25> Not sure...wanna grab a drink later?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Well i would talk to the guy, there should be no MAKING HIM do anything.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> He loved her so much he married her and had kids with her.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Hahaha, you sound like so many other single people I know.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> haha-- mens are free for anything
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> me and my boyfriend are almost 3 months together is it okay to say that i love him already?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> She laughs, we dream... and can't stop smiling.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> Sounds nice, great concept, like wiping w/ 2 squares of paper, grossly innefective.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> wut do u think i should do?
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_35> forget him, y would he live that relationship?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> cause i cant message at school but i can do this.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> he is most definitely cheating on you!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> I like long hair on guys.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> are you asking your boyfriend out or are you cheating on your boyfriend with some other guy?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> so will he divorce with her?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> You've got a set of balls on you!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> girls dont really like fucking around with peoples hearts unless they get paid.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> buy her flowers or something she wouldnt expect
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> you didn't marry his sister or his family and vice versa, you married HIM.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Should I try and talk 2 him in a different way and what should I say?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Ask him why dose he like you?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> hmm it sounds like a test of your loyalty and all that bs.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> That does mean that there not still in love with there 1st love.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> If you mess it up,..no worries,..There is ALWAYS another guy (or girl for that matter).
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Should I try and talk 2 him in a different way and what should I say?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Ask him why dose he like you?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> hmm it sounds like a test of your loyalty and all that bs.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> That does mean that there not still in love with there 1st love.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> If you mess it up,..no worries,..There is ALWAYS another guy (or girl for that matter).
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> if fate permits, things will change and you two will go further.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> im 24 and my wife is 35.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> get over it and get on with your life.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> Pleaze dont push things 4 da both of u. let things go as they progress.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> whats the point of going out or getting married after you'v been hert.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> bon jovi-ill be there for you.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> one for sure sign is if they leave to go to work and never come back...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> IT CAN BE TOMMOROW OR IT CAN BE UR LAST DAY OF LIFE OR UR MARRIAGE DAY.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> 2) how she acts 3)who she hangs out with
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> 3.He always thinks about his family and the only family i have is my mom  What should I do?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> But my reward for hanging in there.....?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> At one time she said she liked me alot but was going to go out w/ someone else.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if you like him after he treats you that way...then you are a masochist!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I just don't think most guys date with the initial intention of getting married, that just comes along later.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> believe me i know i almost lost my finiacia' to a guy, and it hurts me till this day.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Guys (especially teenagers), pretty much only think about sex.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> NO really does mean NO and whether U like it or not they RULE.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> Can u tell me something abt u?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> my man is in brooklyn new york.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> You don't want to hurt her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Well, it's pretty clear that you two aren't an item yet.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> the shy girl because when you get to no them they wil talk to you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> they want to have stories made out of that... pure fun thing to them :)  but then who cares!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> when we love a person, we want him/her to be happy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> thats the key, the rest will follow.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> I dont want to have friends that hate me.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Depends what kind of ladies u want.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> Guys usually don't play games, that's for women to do.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> You need a guy that is going to love you for you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> when u make your mind think before ur heart
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> (he says it's harmless flirting) and calls him when she's having problems with her man.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> if you have to ask this question leave or stay it means you should leave.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> he and i are both very attractive and sucessful.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> first, this is not something guys do it's something this one guy is doing.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> then hell yeah it would be us but that's just it!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> so if he wants to kiss then let him unless it makes you uncomfortable.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Then, find a great guy and have great sex!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> try to see a girl that has alot in common w/ you.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> First of all how old are you?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> And I always thinkg she might find someone better too...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> you go up to that person and ask them out.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> I wake up several times and toss & turn... just never feel rested.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> because girls have holes that we want to put it in.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> if you have to be asking that question, then i don't think it is okay...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> its always nice to exprience something even if its good or bad.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Think about your kids...you might end up with nothin in the end..period
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> If a relationship is heathly...Who should care?....Me, I am no one's judge!...But my own...I'm gay and I Rock!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> And if he says no, then ask him out!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> Some men look good bald too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> WAIT until you are 35.........that's when life gets good.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Once a cheater, always a cheater.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Txs Rngers say: cmon boyz, we got right on our side!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> i noticed the girls do not just admit they like you, they give you signs.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> Also watch MY BEST FRIENDS WEDDING
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> Keep your chin up even though I know it's tough.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> I know it sounds funny but if you really like this guy you should ask him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> when you can't stop to think about that person
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> try calling p-line i found one of my boyfriends there and well now we are just friends
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Thos would defenitely help u dude!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Any place where u like to make love is heaven for u.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> it is ok but you must be carefull cause there are freaks out there.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> And it MUST be a 2 way street.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> this dude wants to kiss me but he has a girlfriend what should i do?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> How much younger...lol  Some women do.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> I know most people who read this will think badly about me, but that's ok, I don't care.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_60> If there is doubt then I would wait.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> i think it really depends on what the female is looking for.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> i think if you married someone- you should stay married unless one does something unthinkable, like cheating or abuse.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> i guess it can be a resterant.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> How to encourage a guy to ask me to go out?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> if kids are involved though, gotta do whats best for them.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Women know it is far wiser to keep your mouth shut and let people make their own mistakes.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> I try, i really do, but it still doesn't seem like we have a really good relationship... :(
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> Trust me she won't care after that.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Men do this sort of thing because they generally get away with it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> ima virgin so anything will help.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> i have noticed that it depends on the girl.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> If they all have their girls going then he has a girl going too, it's just not you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> b) I'm just glad I got one  WOMEN - ALOT!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> You cant let anyone persue you like that.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> !also you need to take things slow if she wants you to.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> I had four kids for him.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> Men do that sort of thing because they can.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> if u are in love just to hear i love u then  u r ot in love at all
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> i guess u just listen to what she has to say.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> all good things to those who wait.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> well if yall only been out 3 times i don't see how u can even love each other.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> I wouldn't do him again, yuck!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Report Abuse   how old is everyone here??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> LAUNDRY...... My God next question please.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Probably best if you just muster up the courage to tell him, though.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I don't like shareing my guys.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> i've been with my bf for about a year now.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> WE DON'T HAVE TO SEE EVERYTHING IN THE DAMN STORE.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> most of the girls are just talk, and never follow through.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> if your crush is married, i donno wat to do but if he is not, divorce your husband
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> I KNOW IT IS HARD BUT YOU WILL FIND THE RIGHT MAN SOMEDAY!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> let him make the first move, if any?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> I like her to but I dont wont to lose her as a friend if I ask her out.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> check your wonderful abilities then trust your self and carry on
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Ok I'm weird.....sex just doesn't feel as good if you aren't with the person you love.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> everytime i do something nice for people i get slapped in the face basically
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> asians have money no doubt about it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> It always hurts to be rejected so there really isn't any way around it?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> it is good to talk to a mature woman
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> BJ, then go bake him a pie.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> If its meant to work out it will, so hang in there.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_50> if not he might be obligated.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Washington DC - the ratio of men to women is huge
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> some have it as a laffy taffy  answ3r3r
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> We are funny about that stuff.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> if its at school, you will find someone else, if is a friend in your circle then ask them.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> it depend which country u belong?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> it would depend on how the chat goes
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> I maybe 52 but I didn't start out that old!HA!HA!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> if you don't talk to her than yeah!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> If you get feelings then they are because of your lust.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> now if she loves u and u love her then stay with her!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> Just be the most what u realy r
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> wait til u get married, lol.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> i hope everthing works out let me no chris_myhll@yahoo.com
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> You must be the GIANT of ur dreams brah, not the dwarf of ur fears.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> you're too young for that anyway and have plenty of time for that later.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> dress sexy and then get naked
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> i have no ideas what to do !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> why would they freak out if they are single it shouldnt be a problem
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> you are not wrong for not wanting a child just like he is not wrong for wanting one.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> Just tell him to back off.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> Being a guy, I can tell you that we don't do well reading signals or taking hints.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> I dont know... do you ask him where he is going?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> BUT this girl who likes him more than me is making him go out with her!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Only if you want it to.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> First of all try gaining her father's trust
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> girl on girl kicks ass guy on guy is nasty
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> (Ladies and gentlemen answer me here i'm drowning!)
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> Umm...it takes me a while, 'k?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> he wants whats his own baby.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> just gotta have faith in another person
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> But it sounds like he wants his cake and wants to eat it to.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> try watching the movie Hitch...you might get a few ideas...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> we've tried yahoo personals, and chat rooms, gay bars, etc.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> NO ... pheromones actually work on the person using the perfume/cologne.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_15> LET HIM COME TO YOU HE DID IT WRONG NOT YOU.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> but now i think he might be with this one girl - not that he has said so.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> U can try it if u want, provided he still dont know who it was).
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> - satisfied customer is their best advertisement!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> Makes me wonder if she is like 12 or something.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_70> tell him whats on your mind.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> not really, why are you even asking this question?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> Next thing I know, he's kinda got a girlfriend.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> go in for the quick swoop.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> just be up front with him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> throw it away and even if you split up in the future never return to the porn.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_10> BE THANKFUL FIRST OF ALL THAT IT HAS HAPPENED BEFORE YOU TWO FINALLY TIED THE KNOT!

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> If he's not living up to what he says, he's lying.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Don't beg for their friendship either!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Well I hope this helps some....I know it helped me let go.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_15> I WILL BE SO MUCH BETTER IF YOU TWO WAIT FOR MARRIAGE!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> keep it going then ask for her phone number but in a way that not so formal.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_45> If you banged her brother, you've got issues.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> They got a divorce, the women re married a few years later.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> thier not as scorned as you
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> only his boyfriend knows for sure...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> 1) first the guy is going to notice her body she needs to look SOMEWHAT good.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> believe it or not, guys tend to daydream more than girls.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> first of all if its a coworker, becareful.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> exclusivity is a good indicator...when it's just the 2 of you dating each other and nobody else.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> .when i call him back do i ask him if he likes me?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> i love my boyfriend and he loves me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> If he is a guy, then he is cheating on you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Why surprise her after you eat??
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> Show up naked and bring beer.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> DONT WORRY U WILL MEET SOMEONE SOMEDAY .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> try to fall in love with him again regardless of his stupid sister.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> make it about her, not you & your sure to get a second date.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> so if you have a gut doubt about it.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> NEVER marry a man just for the kids sake.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_50> look at the cars they drive.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> Or if they call you just to say Hi.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> some guys prefer more cushion for the pushin'!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> Fore go tacky and cheesy pick up lines.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> Why look at porn when you are just right there waiting in bed?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> he will like you so much less when you do.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> you just realized sooner as you get older how dumb it all is.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> Like if you both like movies or things like that.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> she does not act like her self!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> if you want but i would wait and play it out.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> beautiful it makes a girl feel special
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> U may have 2 just ask her why she dosent talk to u as much.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> here's a good date idea, don't be cheap.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> i also think its against the rules, in my college at least.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> It makes it that much more precious when you DO say it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> men- sex men-power women-money ( theres always a gold digger out there )
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> a huge soft bed.... some place where you feel most comfortable and relaxed
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> i also prefer my guys big.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> mabey thats what she means she wants a bad boy w/ roaming hands and rushing fingers.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> Make a U-turn at 7TH ST onto VETERANS PKY[US-27] - go 3.5 mi  3.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Love will not vanish slowly if YOU don't let it!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> i think that would just be awesome for a guy to have it personalized!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> if this is like the nice guys finish last kinda thing, thats easy.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_45> Ask him if he has a gf.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> know that everyone has someone for them out there, and your true love is waiting for you out there.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> You gotta have trust in a relationship.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> Some guys are just as afraid of rejection as girls are.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Is it wrong to laugh at a man when he says Men have needs???

<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> I think he was kidding ;)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> - now, always and forever and to stop asking.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> well i can relate to that being a guy.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL TELL THEM SAVE YOURSELF THAT DRAMA LATER.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> DONT LET HIM KISS YOU IN THE DARK.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> I like guys with short hair.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> so, dont put the blame on your boyfriend, its all about mother nature.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Mak him/her love u by being loveable :)
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> i think about 90% of them do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> well...im in high-school and have been for 2 years now, so ive learned alot!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> I want the wedding of my dreams!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> It soudns like she likes you already, so the hard part's over with.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> why not the precious moments store?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Just because you two are best friends doesn't mean you guys are compatible for a relationship.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> it's time to get some counseling.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> buy them a pair of white socks!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Tell her That there is another great year with the woman of my dreams
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> make her jeleous, by flirting with her friends for instance!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> yahoo chat is pretty good and it's free
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> They will come to realize how bad she really is (if she really is that bad) with time.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> The one who never says 'NO'  ;)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> I wouldn't think that just hers is such a nice idea.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_55> is he trying to make me jealous?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> wow... why did you limit that query to just 2005?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> When you get married she should take YOUR Sir Name!!!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> Just go up and tell her.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_15> HE DOESN'T LIKE YOU, BE BETTER LOOKING AND TRY AGAIN
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> when she talks, listen in that way you will know whats bugging her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Sometime you strike out, but most of the time,... it works out.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> because he would never expect it, take the load off him and surprise the hell outta him...goodluck
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Just think of this.... What if your mother chose to have an abortion when she was pregnant with you??!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> Dont kill me before I finish...LOL.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> If I want them I buy them myself or ask him to pick them up for me.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_40> sounds like you two are just in a rut.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> but i think, in most western countries the virginity issue is no big deal.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> When you find him...ask if he has a brother (haha)
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> If she says no then ask to be just friends.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> stop bing so nosey.... usually nosey people find things they dont want to find...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> Not just to please your boyfriend.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> unlimited music download membership for 1 year
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> they will never talk behind you back.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> It's like a nobody going to tell me who I am thing.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> should i stay, endure it and try to work it out?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> does often tell you that you are the guy of her life does she play interesting games with you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> And I have a camera phone she does too.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> You don't have tell her right off the bat.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Guys think with there minds and women think with their emotions.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> you should tell him how u feel and if he loves you he will understand
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Am I loosing my best friend?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> is he really abusive or are you making this up?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> to me that would be the most meaningful sweetest thing a woman could ever do!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> firs of all it depends on how old u are!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Girls like that will rub there crotch anywhere.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> dont cheat, but especially not with her friend!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> i mean what is the worse that he can say right?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> if you love eachother you will find ways to make it work.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> I think thats ur problem tofigure out no offense....
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> some females do that, make it on you to leave.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> he needs new friends if there that immature
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> But after reading wat u mentioned in 360 blog i think there is something which is seriously wrong...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> And if you love something you always go back.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> If he is smiling really weird and is asking stupid questions and he is staring at you
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> Let's see...if you really hate her, she probably already knows.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> i've seen some cases where they loved each other since they were 5 and got married.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> get out there and be yourself!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> I always find out, its like I sense it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> dont say it before you get to affectionate.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> But like if u over 30 dats stragiht.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> Lots of nice, intelligent girls... ;)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Don't see him one last time.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> get freaky nasty     get down n dirty  do every thing and any thin you only have one first time
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Yes:  Don't sunburn your back on your honeymoon!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> we can't choose who we love only what we do.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> i dont know him butim guessing.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> even though it's olny 2 yrs.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> But, women are just better in hiding, and lying.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> to have loved and lost...because u learned from experiences or [[mistakes]]..
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> maybe she's scared of commitment  does she go around and flirt with other guys???
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Don't worry if women need you or not.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> Or cyber online and all that kinda stuff !
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> i got to end it but i cant.i need to know how!!!!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> hard but true, maybe she does not love u. right?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> SPUNKY MOST OF THE TIME HAPPY AND LOOKING ON THE BRIGHT SIDE AND SOME TIMES A LITTLE WILD
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> say are you doing anything some night & ask her to a movie.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> i dunno u n i havent met u .
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> yes us  girls really do want sex as much as you guys do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> Don't worry, you are only 15 and there are many other girls out there for you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> simply buy her something she wants for a long time...she'll definately chill down
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> i think the modern life and society demands us to pretend that women are the same with men
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> she just wants a good grade, forget about it you geezar
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> i would watch out and not have a real relationship with this person.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> by fame and never be disappointment then remember that failure is the first step to succeed
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_50> If you really dig her ask her out but no sex.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> old guys young guys, it doesnt matter.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> o theres hope a lot of hope trust me
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> yes because we need to get to know people
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> depends if you can find anothr queer near buy
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Surprise her with flowers...forget the sex.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> Maybe she thinks u r some kind a virus or 3.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> I THINK THERE IS MORE INTEMACYWITH A PERSON YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> Most boys wonder what are girls good for anyway?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Because they are just so interesting.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> I love love love silver, blue, black, and sage green... but I'd say that I like BLUE the best
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> we dont have to work as hard b/c dudes are easy prey
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> HE WILL SNEEK THE KISS IN SOON ENOUGH AND YOU WONT HAVE TO MAKE THE FIRST MOVE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Shes says it has nothing to do with me, she just has not sex drive.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> lol, I'm with Wendy on that one.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> If you know what I mean.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> above all he has to be interested in alot of stuff I am.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> But dont worry.. there will be other guys for you to like.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> not too long like to ur shoulders though.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Guys just have urges when they're around pretty girls.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> to make a friend, be a friend...to make a spouse, be a spouse!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> if you ain't getting none, then start masterbating
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> be there for the person, help out, be a friend.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> But if you want to kiss him,..just lay it on him!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> I personally think that's so lame.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Just tell him its your first kiss.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> if i found it a real so i don't have to find it again
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> you want to be able to play.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> its really impossible if they care about you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> If you obesess over them, or die at a young age...
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> 3-4 times a week at least.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> So take it slow and take care
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> I say just leave it alone.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> heres the deal, theres love and lust.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Oh there are so many questions that need to be addressed long before you say I DO.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Are they the bad girls, just like how some girls like the bad guys?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> its like getting drunk u cant feel anythin at that moment but when u wake up u feel everything
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> wE HAVE STUFF IN COMMON BUT WE FIGHT ALL THE TIME TO EVEN NOTICE WE ALSO BECAME FRIENDS.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> do your thing too though, dont just stay home and get so mad that you want a divorce.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> asking u out may seem risky because he doesnt know u like him back.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> Stop and think did you ever give him the idea that he does own you?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> How much do you like the guy?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> Guys are jerks when they try to be nice.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> i believe he truly loves me with everything he has, and he's still around.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Do u believe in love at first sight?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Why doesn't your mom tell your dad who her friend is and be open about their lives?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Yes of course it's normal to have guy friends if ur a gurl
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> u should look at the girls around u even far away from u at all times.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> no he is just a player that all.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> hes great, kind, considerate, gentle, yet hard, and tough, caring, lovable etc.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> it just means that when you do, that person will get the best of you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> if so, how much celebration does it warrant?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> dude, i'm 21... and i once went out with a chick who was 17.... it's all good.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Sex as a weapon is just stupid.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> However, that does not mean you dont have a chance with them.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> so is he trying to make me jealous or is he just a player?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> once in a while, and as long as it isnt a constant thing.)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> better do not dare..it is not a good chance  why is he/ she old?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> if she cant help but go after other guys then forget her(that happens at any age).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> it's how you get a job, dumb ass !
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> anyway, he may be saying it because he means it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> in my opion it is better to not get involved with someone who is married.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> And trust me if he did all this, he would not be faithful.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> you don't really like him like that.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> I spent $65 4 Christmas on him.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_25> so my advice would be to quit being so shy!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> she has been talking on the phone to a guy she met online/but not in person!
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> Believe me he likes that Big Butt!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> I don't feel the same way about her as I used to, but I stilll like her a lot.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> if your intimidated she will know.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> If she's like that you can take her to a perk.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> it depends how how much younger
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> are you a compleat prude or any thing?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> through my ups and my downs and he still doesnt leave me at all.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> And you dont deserve this kind of man.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> go to an interview with playboy or sumthing
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> Such a bad idea if you decide to hook up with her.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> the girl he cares about more than himself...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Also, its from a 14 year old guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> My friend TOTALLY backstabbed like three of my good friends.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> Fatherly.....wow......should this really be this far down the list?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> say mom dad i have a boyfriend and i would like you to meet him
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> OK, first  be careful who you hang out with.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_10> BUY HER FLOWERS TAKE HER 2 THE MOVIES KISS HER!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> If it got to that point,  A REAL MAN WOULD BE HEADING FOR THE DOOR.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> They either do or they don't.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> But that doesn't make it right.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> It isn't good, I will tell you that much.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> Who cares how much money he spent?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Just The Two Of Us  A Grover Washington/Bill Withers Version
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> show lots of cleavage and use the bedroom eyes.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> So I am going to say - NO!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> you can start by spelling loser right.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> If you can find true happiness in the relationship then MORE POWER TO YOU!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> but i really love my bf.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> sort of like if walmart sold xxx movies.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> the mysterious and fun loving brunettes.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> Pretty much the same thing girls think about guys but in reverse.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> b/c your always on this darn computer looking at these ridiculous computer conversations!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> if you havent yet, dont let it bother you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> Turn  on WILBANKS RD - go 0.3 mi  10.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> There can & will NEVER be trust between you because look how it started.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> well i see how you feel.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> you cant just find it, you have to create it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> i got to know this gal thru online chat.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> Sure......... go to your Dr. if u think u have an STD.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> But she never told you (not that she has to).
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> you are not with her now so if she says no you are no worse off.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Not my idea of a boyfriend.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Act like I don't see him?..wave?..
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> That people even have to ask questions like this is so disturbing to me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> what you think, girls dont wanna have?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> next to a jewelry store ;-)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> About what girls really think of guys..
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> the same is happening to me
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> Go to yahoo messenger and find the country you want
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> Tell him your answer is NO!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> if you donb't then she progbably won't even know u excist!!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> The only stupid part is staying with some one that is cheating on you.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> none of his or my female friends are our type.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> yes if your old enough like usually 19 cuz u pick a better guy or girl when ur older.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_45> You both need to get a life.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> UNLES YOUR MOTHER HAS A GOOD REASON TO WORRY?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> But it should be whatever the girl likes.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> maybe you can have some backdoor action with her?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> :) i would know i have had a crush
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> well i hope i helped ya out!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> LET HIM KNOW YOUR NOT AFRAID OF CLOSENESS EVEN IF YOU DONT KISS THAT NIGHT.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> Girls like guys that are romantic.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_45> PLEASE, PLEASE, do not listen to any of the above.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> if u really love him and when He really loves you he will tell you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Can't you find girls in college?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> he likes you  but could not find a good flower
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> (Both your dad and JEN are dishonoring that vow, FWIW.)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Don't come on too strong a first.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Be yourself no matter who's watching!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> make u self happy then think about making someone else happy,enjoy life and relax
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Of course, it could be that she wants him to marry her :-)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> I really do care about her and she cares about me too.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> Wash ur socks and kiss ur arse for italian leather?, u bet ur sweet bippy sweetheart!

<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> your either not confident enough, ugly, or your personality sucks
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> You must try and I mean try to move on.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> no beacuse if thats how u feel then naw its not bad
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> yes and no, i say yes because why do u have to tell ur parents EVERYTHING.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> YOU DONT GET OVER IT, WE FORGIVE BUT WE CANT GET OVER IT.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> In the meantime, dont do anything silly ;).
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> it wont hurt to have a killer voice either.. thats my $0.02
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Meaning that it need cared for and about.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> ofcourse if u rate this as best answer :)
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> Well that is the same line I use to get a girlz pants off...

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> If your husband didn't want you he wouldn't have married you.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> !im 14 seeking for lots of advice.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> she invites you to go places with her (10).
<NbChars_280> <LevSim_20> u should also ask- how do i prevent STDs?
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_30> you should be glad you got a second chance of being with someone.
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_30> not sure if anyone will read this.....but it sure helped me get it all out.
<NbChars_255> <LevSim_25> unless u know what she feels theres no question of understanding her.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> it always makes both of you feel so much better (even if you have had an disagreement.)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Guys arent complicated like girls are.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> LET'S SEE UMMMMMMM THIS IS A HARD 1 I BELIEVE BOTH BECUZ  I CAN'T PICK SIDES
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> i would just be totally natural about it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> NO ONE DESERVES 2 B ABUSED IN ANYWAY...NO ONE!!!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> I try and manipulate people to get what I want.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_30> Just want to see what other people out there like.
<NbChars_265> <LevSim_30> Love isn't something that is, just beacuse it once was.
<NbChars_390> <LevSim_20> Guys are feeding you a line.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> anything else you just stumble upon is lust.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_15> BECAUSE WOMEN THESE DAYS DONT CARE IF SOMEONE IS MARRIED OR NOT.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> If you're a good girlfriend for him, then you wouldn't be worried about cheating.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> Wonder what white gals like about asian guys?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> if she loves you or really wants to be wit u, she will deal with it!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> trust me its good to have experience, especially if the other girl has some.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> AS LONG AS THE KEY'S ARE NOT STICKY.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> I MET HIM AT A SPEEDWAY GAS STATION WHERE I WAS WORKING...5YRS, LATER WE'RE STILL MARRIED WITH 4 CHILDREN!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Choose one thing that you know drives her absolutely crazy and she always gets on your case about.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> At least they can drink (I guess!)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> i think its because girls judge ppl by their appearence.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Beware and wait this one out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> secondly why would she hate you for moving?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> no it is not a sin.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> if he gets another girl to give him what he needs.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> yep it doesnt mater where you meet people you always have to be careful
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> Don't be so hard on yourself!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> there is a reason he/she doesn't want you anymore.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> true love finds you you dont find true love.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> becuz there annoying and usually sit on the couch and do nothing all day and they eat 2 much
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> dont give in too the divorce temptations.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> my father died 2 years ago from a cancer that starts with an m i dont remember the name
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> That baby deserves a chance to live!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> write me back with the answer please
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> She said no, so I proceeded to ask her why she didn't want to.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> thats what mother nature forced them to do.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> Read He's Just Not Into Me!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> just get annoyed or freaked out.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> because youare just talking to her then you are just being friendly then.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> i am gay and think i love him but only a month now.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> haha, usually they are in their own little world and they tend to forget things.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> Guys think about the following things about girls:: 1.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> moms' always thinks they know whats best, for and they are usually right.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> if u are seriously shy online, u need help.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> Well you said that you don't feel the same way as you used to.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Rudha, i would like to know abt u a bit.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> Start the conversation with the obvious ... tell her you like the fact that she always smiles!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> But guys don't intend it that way at all.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Or... wait while some1 else does it before u.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> question is not complete, u must mention the type of girls
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Then you're just a bad memory.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> Sex is for the marriage bed only!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> - old habits are hard to break.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> I have alot of favorite colors but the one i like the most is blue
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> though we live together i find that we don't get much time alone.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_45> if in doubt talk to her Drs.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> i would think it to be more special that way!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> How old are you, are you totally clueless?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> If a guy cheats, he's a dog.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> THE AGED OLD SAYING NATURE KNOWS.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> I see ppl mess up everyday  or make love mistakes everyday.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> the problem is you can't....but if he really cared about you he'd have more than sex on his mind!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> Even if you didn't do anything wrong!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> Happy folks get on with life.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> He may finally say all right I trust you so stop following me!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> And One Time At Band Camp
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> There really is not any best age to get married.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> I have been married 11 years and I tell you I fall in love with him over and over!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Oh yeah by the looks of your picture who would want you anyway...sicko!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Dude have you seen 40 yrs old virgin???
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Don't force yourself to try it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Your heart will tell you if you are in love!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> why would you go into something you've got no experience in?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> But I miss her every day.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> she might just have the expereince your looking for
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Love its that gut feeling you get.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> put it up for adoption after it's born if you want, but DON'T KILL IT.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> i wanna no if i fit in.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> I like men my height or taller.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> and it also depends and how the guy acts.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> he will try to have sex with you
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> I would have been a kid longer !
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> but maybe they will come back to your question to see who else has answered.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> At least that's what I've heard.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> No; however, YES, if his dongg isn't at least xxxx miles long!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> My ex is a crazy byoch!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> I sure you will have lots of luck.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> and why would you even want someone that would cheat on his wife.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> well... depends of how much you would like to invest in one...
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> !There is nothin sexy about nasty old blood comin out of a kootch!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> You might wanna listen to the lady if you are not playing pranks :-)
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> See how he looks at you girl.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> Be totally casual...you know..Hey there's this restaurant I've wanted to try for the longest time!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> She will worship you in return ...isss thaaat soooo baddd??
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> i fell sorry for the women that you run into.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> due to the way they get the diamonds.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> WHy don't u ask her what she'd want or for her to make a list for you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> because women deal more with emotions, then men do.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> Obviously show him a little boob,Just kidding thats if you want that kind of guy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> like tell me is they mean, flirty.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> Step Four: Get to know HER!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> be the fun girl he knew once upon a time.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> but  here it gooes did it hurt .then they said what ?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> But if you are in love and the other person feels that same way it'd probably feel good, right?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Not sure what her rule should be!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> I am more of an orange or camo turned on guy!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> here mine are warm) how does he react when the subject of who likes who comes up?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Honey those days are long gone!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> mostly it depends on : SEX , PAST , etc .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> sure, what do you have to lose?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> She wa svery glad i told her and she was mad at her hubby.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> STAYING INSIDE OR SLEEPING ONLY MAKES IT WORSE TO RECOVER.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> If you really want to know... ask HIM.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Don't try to talk about it with him, just see how things unfold.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Find another guy for your sexual needs :-) Not everyone is good at everything...
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> a good movie to see with on a date?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> it's just like any thing else such as broccolli,liver,cheese.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> In slot machine, if you get 777, that means you get a Jackpot!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> go do something all together thats fun, and maybe she'll relize that she needs to get out more.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> I even asked her why and she couldn't give me a straight answer.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> we can chat on yahoo      mikegoti1972@yahoo.ca
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> are you really looking at the big picture!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Was I too soon, she seems ok with the term.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> I THINK IT DEPENDS HOW THIS COUSIN IS RELATED TO YOU.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> some prefer the bad boy, while others look for a guy who is gonna lavish them will gifts.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> only if the girl is not my daughter, and i'm the lucky old man ;)
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> dear god thats cofusing just tell him what happoned and apologize........
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> WHO SAID AMERICANS ARE THE ONES WHO HAVE GIRLFRIENDS?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> God did such an awsome job making women and now everyone wants one
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> Their shape, softness, the nipple EVERYTHING!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_45> that isnt to say looks arent important.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> How do you know its them?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> 9 out of 10 chances they are seeing someone else, therefore making them cheaters!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> It was like looking at Tommy Lasorda.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> they will usually go for the money
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I don't want to be caught.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> just like me, they long to be, close to you
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> Black men like big butts and breasts even if the woman is fat.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> is ruff sex a bad thing?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Dont let him get to you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> you sometimes don't don't want to believe the feeling because you have gotten comfortable with that person.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> MO money Mo money Mo money...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> Grow up...become an automous WOMAN...and then go out and CHOOSE a MAN of integrity who will RESPECT you!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> thats the same question that i asked for years.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> I say STOP spoiling her so much- she is getting to comfy living with a guy and dating you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> so your just the backup boyfriend just end the friendship your getting played
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> remember there is no shame in waiting.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Men who love their women do not do things to make them insecure in any way.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> I lost my virginity at 17 and drunk....
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> BE YOURSELF THAT'S WHAT I LIKE I GUY WHO CAN JUST BE HIMSELF.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Now days more women are with men who don't want to work and do whats right.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> Depends what you use it for.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Don't think another thing about it, hun.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> it doesn't matter that she's black, a girl is a girl!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> He says What when you ask him.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> well  you  should  just  forget that  you are  doing it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> Everyone reacts differently...just have patience and be there for him.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> NO i love to kiss girls and what does that have to do with pets?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> you know for sure when you don't doubt.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> not to sound mean but why do u care?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> funny, kind, strong, common sense, and well what the women has as her strength.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> dont get married until your finacaly stable.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> amorous<--- i think that is how it is spelled.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> and if he really loves you he or she will wait!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> (I ran from this guy since all he wanted wasn't what I was giving)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> i think what you should do is to act like if you r not feeling her anymore.
<NbChars_265> <LevSim_30> So go out there and live!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> Sometimes no strings can be fun...just be careful & protect yourself...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> some girls are more interested in somebody with money instead of making it themselves
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Sounds a lot like my 10th grade year.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> but they are still dating and still living together.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> But don't cheat, it makes you a really really lame person, a weak person, an amateur.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Maybe a candle lit dinner with a teddy on.. who know's... GOOD LUCK  :)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> well does age have something to do with it??
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> I am definitely not trying to say thay can't help themselves...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> Probably not, but it could work....no probably not.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_50> should i or should i not?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> you really should be asking why people in general cheat, not just wives.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_50> That actually worked for me once.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> No, they could have just not found the right person.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Same as all women are looking for in men: Security
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> I find it 'ONE of the best books I've ever read'!!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> Some men prefer bigger some man smaller breasts...
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> do the rings bearers walk before the flower girls?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> IT USUALLY HAS A GOOD OUTCOME UNLESS SHES STUPID ENOUGH TO THINK UR SPYING ON HER.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> at first sight it might be lust.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_45> tell a friend to ask him or her
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> stalk him/her, they'll get freaked out on put a restrianign order on you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> did someone tease at school etc.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_5> only money not even sex just $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> you should go watch it with your date it might be a little long though
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> It means a lot that people still care.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> I don't mean by buying her things......I mean by a gentle touch.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Um i would just to be nice..
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> no... obviously you know she has a b/f.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> If he does and he lloves his little girl stay.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> show her how to eat properly and encourage her each day.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I hated my life after that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> One of my friends did it, and she says she didn't make it happen, it just did.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> talk to her about it - try to be as calm as you can to start out.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> Girls like lots of things silly.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Find couples to hang out with!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> and is my best friend for more than 1 year
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> If you have to ask questions like this about your relationship.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> No guarantee tho, because some men never grow up.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> If he were any kind of man he would not be married and dating you!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Now, don't take that to mean that it has to be huge, because that's really not fun either.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> Flirt with her till she knows it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> I know i definately would want to know.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Definately ur relationship is some wat different .
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> IT IS UP TO YOU TO LEAVE OR STAY.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_45> be happy with each other and enjoy life.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> dont make it a racial thing.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> why have a wedding if its gonna suck, you might as well just elope.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> no you dont ,but you will need a lawyer for each state
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> they might not be the crazy one look inwards
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> NOW YOU TELL ME - What does that tell you?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Just because you look it doesn't mean you want to buy.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> man just get over it... you will get mates not a mate...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> LET HIS NAME AND LOCATION BE KNOWN TO THE WORLD!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> no if you try your an idiot
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> naked pictures... or jumping up and down naked... both work..
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> so be honest..talk it out and be willin to try new things.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> ^ I agree lol thats funny

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> its better but it can be more painful.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> If you're hiding stuff, you're probably cheating.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_50> Both need to be good to go!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> If he's bigger than you and has a bad temper you should be.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> I WANT YOU TO KNOW RIGHT NOW, that they are wrong.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_35> love for yourself....all else is secondary

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> We fight about it and he still dont care.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> And when you decide to leave her alone she gets even more upset???
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> Butt out and get a life
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> Your the one she PROMISED her love to.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> It depends on your preferences...  :)

<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> Same goes with IM, do not archive your messages.

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> coz 2 stupid makes no difference
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> What the hell am i suppose to do???
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> AND SO WE COULD SHARE IT WITH OTHERS.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> in general..white men prefer smaller women..hence the asians they like,too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> You should say, He's not in my life anymore, so quit asking me stupid questions!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> plus you might be able to get some some on the side, you know what i mean right!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> do you know about his past?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> i use myspace and xanga check out my myspace n xanga!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> honestly i think you should just out and out tell him.

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> Long winded way of saying: Chill.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> with an transplant of hear full of love.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Others would find blonds, readheads or even grey hair sexy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Just put them all together n you got the perfect girl!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> sometimes no means yes, and yes means no.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> Honey, I thought told you to wait in the truck!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> Their shape, softness, the nipple EVERYTHING!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> so technically...the question shouldve been Y R GUYS SO STUPID AND SLOW!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> So why do you guys think this happens?
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> I guess I'm going to go to hell when I die.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> It really sucks actually, cuz your like damn I screwed it up.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> but it does sound like cheating.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> Make compliments... Talk about what you are interested in...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> slap him in the face and remind him who he is
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> Using lube will help a lot too.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> It really sucks actually, cuz your like damn I screwed it up.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> but it does sound like cheating.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> Make compliments... Talk about what you are interested in...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> Using lube will help a lot too.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> I told Darryl but he's willing to take me back...
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> go out and meet a beautiful girl.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_10> BECAUSE THERE IS NOT GOD IN THE RELATIONSHIP
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> depends who she is, cuz alot of the time its not worth it.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> Or how do I find out?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> yell at him in front of a nun, because that would just be rude...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> These things sound like it'll make your reunion that much sweeter!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> DUH YU BOTH LIKE EACH OTHER BUT YU EITHER OF YU DONT WANT TO ADMIT IT
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> Just call her and take a chance.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> you should try and use a phone.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> be romantic but dont be tuchy feely, make sure that she is comfortable with it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> ANY advice or ideas on what is going on??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Looks alone will not do it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> If they don't like how he looks or where he lives, then too bad.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> every one in my high school had one, it shouldn't be so hard if you are good looking
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> THERE ARE FEELINGS THAT WE HAVE WHEN INFATUATED, THAT WE DON'T HAVE WHEN WE ARE IN LOVE.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> good luck buddy.. but take a long time..
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> They want something easy or they are sluts.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> I think all in favor of females always have it on their mind!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> But, I guess you knew that.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> if u love him then no
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> Yeah, You just have to have a lot of money!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> And i love it, dont get me wrong, i love every second of it.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> If you want to marry him.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> Oct. 16 1996, and they have 3 little girls!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> Dude you sound so wishy washy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Or is he cheating on you, or stealing money from you.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Its been my experience that most men set there sights to high.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> EYE CONTACT IS THE MAY KEY
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> If you are serious about her, dont let your guy friends mess things up between you!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> Just kiss her in front of people.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> I like the medium ones :)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> that person wont judge you no matter what you do.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> He was 19 and she was a 29-yr-old divorcee with 3 kids!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> he stood me up for two hours and its not the first time
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> A lot of humour and crayons.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> im with bruce on this nye tends to bring out the slut in us
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Obviously it didn't start out like this, otherwise you wouldn't be with that person.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> So, you should be happy to be so.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> Good thing: They listen to what you say.
<NbChars_295> <LevSim_15> With that in mind....GO FOR IT!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> The one you truly love -> you can't miss that feeling.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> I had a problem like that no to long ago.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> maybe because birds are afraid of getting close to people ...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> yes and no see prostitutes do it for money and some have children and need the money.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> start being nice to her return everything that hers  and keep talking  to her
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> i'm 11 and i wouldn't mind going out with 2D though hehe
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> I mean, am I just a booty call?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> and tell a neighbor whats going on.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> i reccommend using lube, even if you are wet for the first time just to make it easier.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> take it easy for the first time.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> (please exuse my spelling, i suck w/ it)
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> You definitely want to avoid comparing him to them (Bob always did this or Jim never did that).
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> Show her love during the day.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> if it is ruining ur life, u should talk to her.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> they suck, but so do STD's.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Ideas: -ipod -sweater shrug (very hot right now) -pink moto razr cell phone -concert tickets -romantic weekend -bird feeder
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> But ask her, not us, ok?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> IT SOUNDS HARSH AND HOPELESS BUT YOU GOTTA TRY AND TRY AGAIN.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> only u can answer this question....... my gf was a senior and i was a soph.. when she graduated.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> Oh, and a guy whos cooks is great, too!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> So i told his wife  right after he tried.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Yeah, if you're stuck on getting with her.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> If you like giving that person what they need/want... That is a good start for some quality lovin'...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Therefor you love her too, don't cha?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> find someone single and tell the cheater bye
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> Most caucasion men don't like fat women.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> LOVE IS PROOF  THAT GOD IS WITH US  IN THIS DARK WORLD.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Now, if this is the guy asking this question, then you have issues.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> YOU KNOW LOVE ESPICALLY YOUR OWN BUT TO DETERMINE THE OTHER PERSON LOVE FOR YOU IS THE HARD PART
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> find someone single and tell the cheater bye
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> Most caucasion men don't like fat women.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> LOVE IS PROOF  THAT GOD IS WITH US  IN THIS DARK WORLD.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> Now, if this is the guy asking this question, then you have issues.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> YOU KNOW LOVE ESPICALLY YOUR OWN BUT TO DETERMINE THE OTHER PERSON LOVE FOR YOU IS THE HARD PART
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> (a video tape of you confessing your love, singing....
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> Does he always seem happy to see you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> you guys could go out as friend to like a movie or something fun.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> also, i dont think you should let her know you asked this question bout' her on the computer.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> And the gal always think the guy is infactuated towards her !
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> I am not so sure why I dont like it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> the real question is if he really loves you?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> I see lots of guys anytime I leave my house.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> age is just a number and if she is mature enough, overall its her descision as a legal adult!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> I mean if its the second date I suggest u dump him.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> it's not what you buy, but what you give.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> you have to atleast be able to feel it, or even find it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> yea i think you should ask her.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> When you just like someone and dont even think why because you just do...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> And nice teeth, gotta have 'em all and WHITE!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> He's like one of the best guys ever.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> who has a good head on his shoulders.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> try aa  if you cant get him sober get awy from him  hell destory you
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> Maybe you havent found your true love!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Gosh, what does she like to do?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> im sure you will like it there.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Drop em both and find some folks to hang with who aren't so confused!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> something had to make that relationship that bad
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> i say you should talk to him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> And you just want to be friends.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> Well good luck with the ladies!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> girls like lots of stuff, but you have to be more specific.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> Good luck and dont forget to Strut!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> Hard to get mad at your your own team mate..Lol.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> We just have to except it and move on.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Oh - anyone would be so lucky to get that!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> I GUESS IT ALL DEPENDS ON YOUR DESIRE TO FIND A SOULMATE
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> this will help lighten the load so the both of you can go to your mom together.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> when you're really in love, you don't wonder if he's the one.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> we left a 4 bedroom house.I'm   not sure if I'm making a mistake?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> Oh - anyone would be so lucky to get that!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> I GUESS IT ALL DEPENDS ON YOUR DESIRE TO FIND A SOULMATE
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> this will help lighten the load so the both of you can go to your mom together.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> when you're really in love, you don't wonder if he's the one.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> we left a 4 bedroom house.I'm   not sure if I'm making a mistake?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> And ofcors, most important thing is brain...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> MOST WOMEN LIE ABOUT HOW MANY GUYS THEY'VE SLEPT WITH.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> Jealousy mostly, but it really is his problem not yours.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> but some do it because they feel they need to rule you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> being lovely from all people like how i love him
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Well the NO is already there because you are not with him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Now go see a psychologist before i slap you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> I've heard some women say that their first time didn't hurt (or maybe not so much).
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_45> Read Sex for Dummies by Dr. Ruth!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> well u could still be lovers n be friends.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> If she loves you and you love her...then no worries!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> I dunno, probably because it keeps the human race alive.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> i dont think its alright to get friendly you never know when  he might get in love with her.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> Either they do or they don't.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Or she'll be surprised and responde to u.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> i tink its not important becoz, in a relationship..u need a personality and the attitude that is really attractive...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> things like that should be a clear sign of how he feels about you =)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> tell your mom that you dont like her family.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Because its a part of life...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> LOOK THEM IN THE EYES AND IF THEY START TO SMILE THAY ARE LYING
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> try impressing me with your other end!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_70> Even if you're just friends with someone, go out.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> SO CHOOSSE YOUR PARENTS TO BE YOUR BESSTEST FRIEND FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> If she doesn't like you, it's NOT PERSONAL!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> If you guys are friends, then you can definitely send her a card.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> Go to clubs -- Line dancing, karaoke, sports bars, comedian night, etc.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Go out with my friends and flaunt what I got.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> just say do you like me or her
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> Didnt you get hurt when you fell from Heaven......
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> I don't think it's too soon.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> you just don't know what their responce is going to be.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> but i have never heard of reduction.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_45> everything that happens has a cause, find out what the cause is and fix it
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> if gal is sweet, slim, cute sort of average breasts are far enough.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> I will miss him terribly, by the way!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> They fell for the wrong guy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> I wear mine on my ring finger because it means more!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> SOMETIMES IT CAN BE CEMICAL AND A EASY FIX.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> He said Oh that's wonderful we're going to drink champagne tonight!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Have you ever seen skid marks in your own pants?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> What ever you do...don't be drunk when or if you decide to have sex.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Just don't get her any that she is allergic to and you will be o.k.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> ask him to his face... live your life
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> when u see anything familiar and widespread do u'll do it without fearing
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> search better... and low your aspectations..
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> What can I say, I'm a catch!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> 1 - Should she leave him?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> cause you are other fan of the carpenters!!!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> a women who sleeps aroud with other people even thougfh they have a bf
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Good luck with however you like.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> Do you call even your girl frinds every day?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Im not sure but I dont think its your thumb.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> At 50, a 32 year old.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> ...guys in their late 30s/early 40s...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Yahoo is one of them !
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Im pretty sure it doesn't mean anything.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> tell her the truth...she may understand,i mean shes your best friend...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> But if you think it's REALLY serious then you have to trust him that he won't be hurt.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> It's like telling them that they can't go shopping on Wednesdays.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> Not like a old maid either.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> if he does then size won`t matter.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> and if he tells you what hes doing .. is he lying to you???
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> cheap and good is the best way to go.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> if you think your ever gonna find someone who is equaly mature as you your nuts.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> how long has it been since u guys haven't talked if long then just move on.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> I know because something  like that happened to me to !!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> go down on her or use your fingers softly
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> their waiting 4 him to die,get his money and find a younger man?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> yes, you can too me its personaly natural i'am mean whats a relationship with out any hatred in it
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> it ain't the size of the wave, it's the motion of the ocean!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> that is what it turns me most.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> If you really like him then you should be like dude I like you and say me or her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> What if he asks questions ?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> why would they admit they're cheating if they're getting away with it.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> (i.e lots of hugs or geez your hands are cold.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> If that doesn't work he is gay
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> it's not that women like the taste of sperm, it's to please their partner.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> (its been a year now) I'm lucky to make love once a month.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> All I can say is good luck!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> He wants me to be super-aggressive & it's just not my thing.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> guys don't always think a bout sex 24/7.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> 1st time shame on him 2nd time shame on you 3rd time your a damn fool
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> well first just go up to her and ask her how she is doing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Funny thing is I realized that the other guy I loved more.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> I won't go out with an older man, unless I found him attractive.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> NO THEY GO TO THEIR OWN INSTINCTS ON WHAT THEY WANT T ODO
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> You don't jump up and start yelling HEY PUPPY COME HERE!.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> Their is no such thing as a girl friend when your a married man.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> I know, was married 15 years to a person I barely liked but she had my two sons.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> you don't wanna have a guy with a weak heart or less of a character.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> because he already loves someone else
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Sure it is, as long as there isn't a naked guy there with her :P
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> who you are, where you from
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> has told us they are hot.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Nice point Mace, women _love_ shopping.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> If he doesn't want it you can always ship it to me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> I wear thongs and I wanted to know if guys like them!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Guys: How long would you stick around until she does?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> if she does not bring a date have one set up for her.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> (and most of us over analyze things!)
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> we dont do anything fun, he keeps me in like a hermet.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> talk to him and ask him what is up.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_10> JUST SAY YOU ARE SORRY FOR BEING A JERK............
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> just accept him for his flaws, someone might even see you as immature as well.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> ask if he want to go out and then go from there but no sex on first date
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> BITE IT OFF TONIGHT AND TELL HIM MERRY CHRISTMAS YOU BASTARD
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> big teddy bear w/real diamond earrings
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> just start flerting with her magnificent body but if she slapped you, am not responsible

<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> If he wants nothing serious, then go where your heart tells you.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_20> Trying not to be too cold here, but ARE YOU INSANE??!?!?!?!?
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_55> Not to say other women dont.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> u'll find the right guy, there's some1 for every1.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> i hope thats not ur mom or dad cause that would suck1!!!!!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> But feel free to pick up the tab once in a while.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Other wise, move on and find someone who really deserves you!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> maybe you kinda learned to like him just because he is the only one around.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Or they are desperate to get a guy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> If you were a guy id say.. Are you crazy ?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Dinner and a movie always works!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> She has to be very relaxed!!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> remember  chicks b4 dicks.. and in love there should be change cause ther is soo much compromise.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> I guess it all depends though!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> so whats worse making two meals or losing your best friend
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> did you grow up near gay people?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> hi, this question was repeated earlier.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> I think they should do something to these little fast ass girls.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> i dont know y they don't make me leave
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> do you really want a friend who treats women badly?tell him he has lost a friend and a wife
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> so when we try to get a clear answer, yall can't make up your mind.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> If I want to fight I'll get into poitics.. :D
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> An idea that is in your head.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> If you know somebody that go to that school, ask if they know that person too...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Find someone that you enjoy hanging out with and then ask them to be your girlfriend.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_20> and you look that good , man.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> She sounds like my last girlfriend (someone I nearly proposed to).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> I'm guessing your not the brightest bulb in the house??
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> ok i have been seeing this girl for 2 months.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> took the good girl to xmas but lookin for the bad girl on NYE...... ;-B
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> your time and attention...now get offline and get to it
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Just admit it that you were just looking.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Just make sure they never come between you!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> It's because you don't have them.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> ...and that may sound harsh, but I mean it kindly.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> what they have onthe outside could be very different from the inside
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> depends on her age and if she is a relative
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> If you are a guy, ask a chick.
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_25> No.But some men are really sex maniacs.
<NbChars_250> <LevSim_30> because you are not looking in the right spot
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> PLEASE OH PLEASE DON'T LISTEN TO THEM.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> you might have low self esteem
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> plus according to my guy friends if girls didnt do that half the funof gettin them would be gone.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> well yeah a lot of boys do.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> Dump his sorry ass and live well.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> one thing you could ask yourself is, do you guys have good comunication together?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> NO, I like to kiss girl
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> u can never tell boys are really weird unless he makes it obvious
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> it's definately alright with him, and he knows why.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> If you only met her once, are you sure she is your girl friend?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> i'm 13 so i don't have more than that and i spent a lot on xmas
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> Absolutely NO, Would any guy find a farting lady sexy?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> Just be straight with her and be like im sorry but this just isnt working out .
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_25> HUH, is plastic hot, are brainless bimbo's hot...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> keep it up - you're scoring huge points with her...
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> it might scare her off, not wanting her life with you on here.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> Too many things happening out there in the concrete jungle...so you would have to be very careful.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> no it just mean there is something wrong
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> I'm a 22 yr. old lesbian & have a crush on a beautiful older woman...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> On average most men don't really care about all the little details in the wedding.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> but i think that most wives cheat because of lonliness and lack of intimacy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> it depents if you have contiunous comunication!!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> Do you want to hang out?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Maybe its your right ring finger.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> ONLY THE NASTY ONES LIKE YOU DO
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Girl, I was just having the same conversation with a friend of mine.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> But i would be tempted if u wear pink.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> but 12 years later, im still wishin'.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> you won't have any pain after that.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> but you might not be soft hearted like i am!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Do whatever it takes, but get out of there.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> and when you think your ready talk!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> And if they are, those are the ones that don't last.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> try tickets to an event (sporting, concert, etc.)
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> find some ugly stupid not cool friends kidding i'm not sure how to do that
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> tell him get back together or theres no way you can continue a relationship like that with him.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> First you have to get him to admit he wants to quit.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> I need answers from both sexes Plz ;-)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> life is always fuller when you have love.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> well that may just not change.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> if she fails either of the 2nd 2 tests, go back to square 1.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> break up, and Run forest run!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> 2 me, not really, it just depends on wat u think
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> I have no idea but you sure have one hell of a talent for coming up with questions.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> so you had a bad experience, big deal, so have i.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I've done this before with close friends and it really helped them a bunch!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Just a little friction just the right way, and hey  we're ready!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> rob this girl from you frd
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> i thought an ankle braclet had a meaning of some kind, i am wrong?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> he loves you but heis best friends know whats up with him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Air Supply, Making Love Out Of Nothing At All
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> if you take expect something to happen and sometimes things do not go the way you think they will
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> IF NOT TALKING TO HIM WILL  HELP RECOVERING PROCESS.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> They are just trying to run your life.Thats what it sounds like to me.Do what you think is right!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> He has gotten in the habit of step one, step two, bingo...over!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> but remeber, the power is not in the breast but the nipple.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> If he's just friends then it's fine.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> First off, do the usual and ask their name...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> women change after sex, they get even more moody
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Everyone needs time on their own...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> montel had a great show about it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> u can use the ever most popular phrase don t worry its me not u !!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> a person should not rush to loose thier virginity.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> if the retina moves to the right... its an indication
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> it seems like the only reason you want tater back is because now you're alone.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> we've always liked eachother ever since we met, but in prior relationships!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> Smart, sexy, hot, or fun girls can all be terrible in other ways.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> I don't know too much about girls liking it, but my buddies who whack off sure do!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> just tell him that if he don't switch it off, you will turn on yours
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> Initiate the foreplay....you deserve some O's too!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> hell to the nah a long distance relationship would never work out, trust me it wont.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> ok not all girls are like that.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> i truly luv her she is the one no dought but we are only 15 and she doesn't no
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> its what men tell to women to get them to the bed
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> They got married when he was 22 and she was 33 and they're still crazy in love.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> If hes your boyfriend and he does not notice you, THATS SAD!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> I DO KNOW YOU CAN PROBABLY CONTACT ME ON ME E-MAIL IT'S HOLAGURRL411@yahoo.com
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> u cant controll ur heart .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> No way can she not want to show you in return how much she loves you too!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> well don't call him n bug him cuz he might say ur eazy!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Basically speaking, we'd do anything for the other person.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> then girl make your bed rock as hard as u can!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> If ur married, NO.....just isnt right....would u like ur spouse to cheat on u?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> its possible that you have nothing to do with this
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> Tell her thats how guys are born.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> then girl make your bed rock as hard as u can!!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> If ur married, NO.....just isnt right....would u like ur spouse to cheat on u?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> given on the family member, sorry.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> its possible that you have nothing to do with this
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Tell her thats how guys are born.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> But don't try to hard, girls can always tell and there is nothing more unattractive or repulsing than desperation.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> a home boy have u ever heard of the song  lovers n friends?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> he well tell you that he like's you
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> It just looks like the guy has no self-confidence.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> I am 13 and just wonderin
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> no honey, probably not on the long term.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> Grrrs are crazy about men, cause men r crazy about grrrs.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> have you discussed it with him?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> THE ONES THAT HAVE SLEPT AROUND A LOT ACT AS IF THEY'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> it all depends on the person you have a crush on.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> Kissin another guy is really bad.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> Men are dogs well lots of them are NOT ALL ARE!!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> )Look DON'T do it GOD Will BE MAD.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> Which was funny caus ehes a dick.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> so you can have some type of play back for both your mom and the police.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> It seems like they've gotten to an age, where they don't care what people think.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Keep looking and don't give up.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> maybe youre like me and find that there are too many mean people in the world.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> It's not that it's yummy, but it's not so bad !
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> sure they will!after all a hottie like u is gettin' married
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> It is so not worth it!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> You're doing a great job already... Tell her exactly what you've told us.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Girls use them cause they are saver and u dont have 2 make it breakfast in the morning!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> GIVE HER SOME ROSES AND CHOCOLATES AND JUST KISS HER ON LIPS.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> If he doesnt, at least you are having fun and probably dont need him anymore.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> i jump to what i love and if he fell the same way then you are cooking with gas!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> is there a way to stop this or should i just join the club to make it even?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> smell good look good and have a possitive attitude
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> no one is worth ruining a good relationship!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> what will you do if you like somebody,and he/she did not like you back.what will you do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> All he wants you for is sex
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> use your tongue, but dont over crowd the other persons mouth with it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> black and green = get him an xbox (not 360) and netflix
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> because you have a higher sex drive then him you need sex more often.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> alright Liv Tyler tell Ben Affleck to put that animal cracker in your mouth already!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> it's really one of the girls attractions.....
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> and you are the one, but if not true do not use it as a line.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> PUT IT THIS WAY IF YOU REALLY LIKE HER GET HER SOME REAL DIAMOND EARINGS.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> not one man is the same and because their are so many of us,there are so many different prefferences.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> If that doesn't work, get yourself a drug habit..lol
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> ps - While hes gone, wanna hang out?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Probably because he knows how men are.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> i know that we're friends and nothing more ever again.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> if so, then see if she's trustful.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> If you want to be with him then don't expect anything out of it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> and dont cover the other persons whole mouth with your lips.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> Usually guys who date alot have commitment issues.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> take good care of you self becouse  you have something realy especial.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> and the best way to find out is to ask him out.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> what normal guy wouldn't like a naked girl at home when he walks in the door?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> Hey, I'm looking for aliens too!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> (sorry, that is the only word i could think of).
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> I finally said this:  Look, there is no way that we will ever be romantically involved.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> no one is mr. or ms. perfect.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> it's because people find joy when they're having sex?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> I firmly believe that even the best of the few good men out there are really jerks deep inside...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> or go to yahoo chat, thy have a interracial dating chatroom in the romance section.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Guys these days just dont value respect the way they did way back when!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> Want a 10 point for this
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> if u luv him go 4 it as soon as u see him
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> Guess what I got it and You can't have it is a great attitude to have.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> im sure she knows and always has known that someday you would want/need to know.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Well tell him things that actually matter.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> You call him your guy friend?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Next time I would go with him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Don't let anyone else tell you otherwise!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> and if he has a rep for cheating then why set yourself up for heartbreak!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> I knew before I ever even spoke with him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> The same way one woman likes pizza and another likes sushi....just personal preference.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> She'll just have to get over it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Its not bad if you like it and nobody actually gets hurt.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> Finally, remember that women cheat on men too!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> Otherwise ..great he's being honest but nope , no ring on your hand yet!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> WHEN YOU ARE A YOUNG CHILD YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENCE IN LOVE AND HATE.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> But I kinda like this other guy in Hawaiia.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Like my mama always told me, Mind ya own business.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> because you have not met me yet
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> You probably just pick the wrong women.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> ya give up on him girl.. it could probably work out but it will most likely get ugly...
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> i'm 27 and my girlfriend is 40 and I dont think its gonna work.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_15> thats true(all those answers up above)!i'm a russian woman and that is it(thats not why i'm here).
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> only if he's breathing really heavey.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_10> Because that's the way love goes
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> ya give up on him girl.. it could probably work out but it will most likely get ugly...
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> i'm 27 and my girlfriend is 40 and I dont think its gonna work.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> thats true(all those answers up above)!i'm a russian woman and that is it(thats not why i'm here).
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> only if he's breathing really heavey.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Because that's the way love goes
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Plus, girls look at other guys too.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> a new place will help a lot.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> She grew out of it, I think.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> in what year did they get married
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> if they think thier in love then thats how they feel.i don't know!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> you have to say wat age/grade you are.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> by her charming smile which the man will never find the same
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> I guess it goes to show that, even if you're not dating, you can still get dumped.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Men are very different, some like breasts, some like butts, some like face only, while others like sluttish looking.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> i rily like blue but why they are using them as that way
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> depending on the area you are in.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> DON'T RETURN UNTIL YOU'VE SOLD 12 PAIRS OF SHOES.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> I not sure if were going to reconcile.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> it would ne nice..especially if u are askin them to leave for awhile so u can be alone.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> Be careful though, she might want to just be friends.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> You keep doing what you do.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> I wanna come out of this.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> is he hot if so heck ya if not no
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> just go up to him and ask thats what i did to ask out my girlfriend
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> i am not saying your mom will not believe you but there could be a chance that she won't.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> if that dosen't work practice talking with one of your girl friends that you really trust.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> and if so do you think it is possible to ever feel that strongly about anyone ever again?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> And know that eventually, things are going to be ok, even if that moment looks far away right now.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Best way, is to spend time with all three of you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> the 11th finger for a boy, and on your thumb for a girl.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> So try to spend time realy talking with her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> with someone you love it can be very special.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> He says he is in love with me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> thier very deep feelings that we can't control!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> - having a girlfriend while hating people?
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> but his girl (my friend)just broke up wit him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> we do not wnat to continually be hurt!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> dont worry your boyfriend loves you just the way you are!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> go get yourself some and find out.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> Good luck, you already godn'thave anything to loose.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> Want to hang out Saturday night??
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> stalk them back or confront them
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> all we need is some good dick and they can go on they way
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> ask her if she feels for u if no then keep what u feel 2 urself!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> and remeber there is the right person out the for u!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> they have little other objective on earth.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> ur guess is as good as mine
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> lololololol just tell her shes too fat to fuck
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> so he could be ugly but treat her like a queen.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> there are so many things as to why people cheat.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> We really love eachother though, What should I do?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> No, and you should not be.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> b4 he gets to out of controll.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Do you even wanna date exclusively?
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_50> they badmouth others only to hide their own imperfections.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> ( in my opinion) i dont want to feel like im sexin a child...
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_40> Leave him, get on with it.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> something u will learn when u grow up
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> BECAUSE THE WAY THEY WERE RAISE..........
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> playing games is the worst thing to do when you really care about someone.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> what do women really want from men?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> You shouldn't care about what people say and as long as she is happy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> probably because you think in a gay way, act in a gay way...and you like it
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> or have kids with?....people like that is so ignorant and needs to get a life
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> Some men are able to manage them, some aren't or don't think it is worth the bother.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Especially if the guy eats lots of fruits.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> hey its always good to be on ur b/f buddies good side!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> buddy women dont know what they want.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> If you have to ask, you haven't.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> when u getta girl u can show ur tru side.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> dont be surprised if ur women thinks ur so amazing that ur going to leave her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> but if he is sweet he gets sweet in return
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> old if you're trustworthy, responsible, & mature...18 yrs.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> If you really care about the girl then why the heck not?....
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> START  SEXY SMILES WITH  THE GIRL NEXT DOOR AND TOU WILL FIND YOURSELF BEING HER CENTRE OF ATTRACTION
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> I get drunk and stoned and forget abotu work.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_25> Pray and ask GOD WHAT TO DO?
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> if she's really romantic wit you to then fine
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> in love & romance sector b'coz no one answered me b4 i put it in news&events sector
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Chances are she already knows and just can't find the motivation.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> If he love's you he will not have sex   5.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> Go out there and find yourself a fine lady.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_10> THEN IF SHES THAT DUMB U DONT NEED HER, EVEN IF SHES HOT!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> it's been very interesting and entertaining so far!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> Marriage can cost a lot of money!!!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> i still regret it and wouldnt put myself in that postion again.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> Obviously, if my life was on MTv, id be f*ked too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> ;-) And hey, you can always call her on her staring problem.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> If she still doesn't want to do anything...get out now.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> lol well from experience, asking gets you nowhere.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> The dude is a control freak.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> This place turns a lot of guys on...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> if the person rejects u just always remeber things  happen for a reason.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> ya i think some of my friends are jerks because they think the oppsite .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> There are plenty of fish in the sea.. keep looking
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> My dad's side is really fun to hang out with, and my mom's side is always unpleasant.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> buy him a slinky or play-doh.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> kiss him on the tip of his manhood.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> IF HE DOESN'T RETURN, THEN HE WAS NEVER YOURS.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> you can tell if you really love that person open up your eyes.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> anyways, i think that guys would do that only if they felt threatened(ex.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> Talk To Her With out them seeing you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> you cant say for certain he is cheating on you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> not if that's the color you dye your hair!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> In the end if he is the right BOY you two will know it and hook back up.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Get a girlfriend and move on!!!
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> you could well look like bill gates.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> And yes, girls usually like it, they say !
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> Lots of people like me at school.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Guys like myself are good guys who the bad boys don't have the guts to mess with.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> maybe you could sit down with her and try to work things out.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> I walked in on kim kissing another girl.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> its like your asking why is life unfair?
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> somewhere where you can talk, and there are plenty of other people around (so that she feels safe).
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> (IE, Russians wear their wedding bands on their right ring finger)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> If he takes his time you should be fine
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> the guys who act like jerks dont last long.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> also if he cheers you up if your sad
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> one, and make it very pretty
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> If you feel it is a ploy then don't bother.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> just come out and ask them.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> YOU KNOW HOW BACK IN SCHOOL YO HAD THAT STATUS AND U DIDNT WANT TO LOOSE IT?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> I'm just hoping it's not anywhere close to now.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> cuz if he likes you due to the effort you exerted, you won't be happy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> Good looking or not a woman looks for the heart!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Stay with him then go on Jerry Springer.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> its hard to find someone thats completly for you so when u find them you cant help love them.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> if you were in your parents of familys place what would you do???
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> thank u all who answer me!!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> Anyway...  That stuff is usually good.
<NbChars_35> <LevSim_30> because your heart tells you so, and you can feel it inside your heart.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> Ok, that will be $8 please.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> yes you will if you get connected to me
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> NO ONE deserves some pinhead yelling at them.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> For girls, and i am a girl, it was uncomfortable.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Don't let someone walk on you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> The ones that dont... it isn't because they don't like money, its because they make a choice.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Only some idiot redneck would want a girl because her breasts are big or whatever.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> I wouldnt feel bad about it thought.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> like dress nice or something just tell me
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> you're too lazy to get out and meet?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> that just makes if worse for every one involved.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> and have a couple buddies that married older woman
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> if you are 25 years old it,s not ok, but if you are 80 years old.........
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> dont put your lifes in a situation you will regret!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> What were you doing around a brothel??
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> i you know any of his info u can look him up some other way...but damn girl,u fucked up
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> well, dating any races for that matter is not that important.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> your ring finger on the left hand.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> then find 1, she wont just fall from the sky... ask somebody out.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> i hope that it helps u a lot.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_20> IF YOU CAN'T OR DON'T WANT TO REPORT HIM THEN DON'T.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Why do guys lie about it?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> (trying to keep this clean here).
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> thats y guys get so frusterated...b/c theur not as smart as us to fully comprehend!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> But I will tell you a little secret...
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> When men have sex it's just that sex.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> because just like me, they long to be close to you
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> NATURALLY, GUYS ARE MORE TURNED ON BY WHAT THEY SEE.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> love = opposite sex friendship - same sex  (switch if gay)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> everyone says that he still loves me n wants me back... i dont know wut to do
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Spoiled women are alot of fun when you give 'em what they want and then some.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Wow, what kind of women are you hanging out with?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> my friend caught him sleeping around last fall.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> I did and it hurts me every time i see this girl with her boyfriend.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> + let him go, go out w/ someone in your own grade.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> its nice to really know him/her in person to make sure that he/she is not fooling around.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> love makes us all  do dumb thing trust me i know.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> just find a girl that looks nice who you can be open with
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> The way I see it, if you guys are meant to be then you will be.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> they cant depend on their bf or gf 4 evrything, wut happends wen the other person dumps them?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> He even gave me diamond earrings-but now he wont talk to me, i feel rejected.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_5> SO I WOULD NOT WORRY ABOUT IT UNLESS YOU SEE SOME WRONG DOING IN THE FRIENDSHIP.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> It just seems like you are ready then.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> if u do that- you'll score big points w/ him!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> stop looking for her... she'll find you
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> If I were you (and I am not) I would not change a thing.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> try telling her how you feel and bying her things
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> plus you love HIM and are with HIM now not the others.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> like whut is they really about in life
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> Right now you are probably feeling lust.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Depends on what you call cheating...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> you will know when you find it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> I have no idea what a delmarva is...
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> Just tell him like it is.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> so it is only 50% fool proof.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If you really love the girl, you won't be afraid to meet her parents.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> and stay home for a little time to myself.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Do you not like being gay?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> I usually don't spend more than about $20-30 if I can, because a.)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Attention, alot of it is very important!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> no grrr wants a guy with dandruffy, stink hair!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> She is like My sister and I love her alot but I dont know How to deal with this.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> Don't worry, you're not alone there (hee hee).
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> spill it i jus did and it went great
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> It's hard but hang on in there.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Relaity, if it's like men it varies.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> If you want her to do more things in bed than let her know.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> so no use putting an age limit etc.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> The guy always thinks the gals loves him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> maybe it was only lust and not love to start with.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> you picked the wrong guy.. and usually guyz are jerkz.. lol they never really ay attention to u
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> if she is not that close to you, a necklace would be better.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_15> I'M DOING SOMETHING WRONG... SOMETHING DIRTY ..
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Find a girl who you love a lot.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Ask him how its all going.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> you knew how she was before you married her and now you want to use that as an  excuse???
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> plz talke 2 me in arabick if u want thx
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> you might bleed a little your first time
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> A WOMAN...At least in my case!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> ONCE A CHEAT, ALWAYS A CHEAT!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> then wait for her reaction and carry on what she said
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> (**  )<| Dead Fish Ollec, the Fish Slayer
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> only he texts her just friends he says men lie
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> And i think , i don't need to say why .
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> I feel like im being to romantic with my girl and i think that might scare her off
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> you are a diamond in the ruff and she would be crazy to let you go!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> if you find one let me know where and if she has a sister.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> Be sure that he knows, you like him, but don't be stupid(!)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> you will know and if you are young YOU BOTH have your hole life in front of you!!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> Do something really rude to the guy(not to yourself)
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_35> Uhhhh.... no cause way 2 much of an age difference DDDDUUUUUUHHHHHHH!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Too bad you don't live in New England about 400 years ago...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> I just dont want my kids in a shelter.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> hey  my e-mail is pyro_97531@yahoo.com are u really gonna e-mail me
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Please, once you find out, tell my wife!

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> relax... oh, make sure the guy wears a condom.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Play a game on Yahoo Games.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> If not I would say you really don't have much to loose, obviously you are not that happy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> depends on how old you are!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> But guys and girls CAN be friends without the sexual attraction.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> I can't win no matter which way i turn.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> I get upset if I ask for a candy bar and he asks what kind....lol!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> Us guys are dense sometimes (well ok most of the time).
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> GIVE HIM A PEDICURE OR FEED HIM SOMETHING SEXY GET ZANE BOOK
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> first, you kick him to the curb.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> as often as you want, without going broke.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> She said she hated me for awhile.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> i gotta be the worse daughter.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> ain't nothng more then a man like then some good sex
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> there is no rule book when it comes to love!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> love is right or wrong in life
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> I just can't... (rubs forehead) ... understand the way my own gender rationalizes things sometimes.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> Go to your nearest military post/base!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_20> same way u survive a cold,plenty of rest,and juice
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> maybe you should take some time to grow up.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> it takes time to forget someone.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> When you do not have to ask.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> maybe he/she looks like a bird house ^_^
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> plz help he 20 years old
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> If she really likes you, she won't care how much you spend, and b.)
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> Don't use a pick up line on a woman.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> i'm gonna need more details to decide that.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> If you don't know either of them I say keep quiet.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_30> stop and look at the situation!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> Sometimes she misses me like Crazy?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> well it depends where you want the meat.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> good answer, deffintly shows her that you care, but don't act upsessed.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> I take it you mean the two of you used to be together and now your not.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> thats how im gonna break it to you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> Not only am I slim, smart and foxy, I HAVE A ST.BERNARD THAT SPEAKS FRENCH!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Girls love that kind of a guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> But that is to be expected and is a good thing.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> love implies respect, but if u cheat you respect neither her nor you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Also, just try talking to him more, especially if you guys have some interests common...good luck :)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> be friendly keep ur mouth shut and be a strong and silent dude
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> If this person is a life long acquaintence then no doubt.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> women are the deep dark devils of this world.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> Honey, not all women are like that.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> actually i think they should always pick up the tab maybe thats just a southern thing
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> he's the word of your mouth
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> 2. yes he is especialy if she asks him to stop and he does not.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> for guys it's really important to look good.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Yell at the dog, luv tha grrrs!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> If you ask Should I dump my boyfriend?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_10> But my x-b/f cheated on me!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> cus people like to see others miserable when they are
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_25> if you are asking am I a 100% perfect son?-yes&no.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> ofcorse its true girls are all ways trying to test thier men to see if thier seeing another woman.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> he will never say that again.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> take her to a clothes store and ask the assistant for the fatass section
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> tell her before he does some serious damage
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> do things yourself for you until he is ready.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> i never make the 1st move...i need to fight to keep women away from me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> My dad is always supportive no matter what.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> We love corny stuff, so don't worry that it's too weird.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> 'cause they both sex fiends... basically whoever they see that they like... they will hump... thats why.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> love is a very deep word so is hate.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> how can a shy guy start making girlfriend
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> And willing to meet her half way!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> dont try it unless you have meet this person because anything could happen over the internet
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> horn dog...my fantisy is two guys and me
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> i herad that green is the horny color!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> elijah wood because he has amazing eye's!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> promise him you won't tell your mom or dad and if you have to, earn his trust.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Get a girlfriend and try with her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> You got to love to hate, and so on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> my sister did that a lot too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Even if you don't believe in God you can still read it.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_15> IF U GET SLAPPED,SHE IS NOT INTERESTED ELSE URS ASH.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> and your girlfriend/boyfriend knows you're that type then its not cheating...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> it is about interacting with the person u love
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> maybe she sobered up and realised you were ugly when she wasn't drunk *wink*
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> ...I am no longer my own but yours.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> If you have to ask how do you know, youre not.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> :)  actually, honesty is the best way.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Thats some bull, she is getting waxed every night homeboy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Don't ask for forgiveness, women don't forgive.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> you make your own decisions just dont worry about it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> and you'd get more agitated if they persisted.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> then, you e-mail me so we can talk.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> two outta three aint bad, little cuzin   :-)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> he's got a problem, same thing happens to me even after one beer, I know what a wuse!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> If I just like boinking you and you like boinking me then it all about the boinking ain't it?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> I have met 2 guys online and they both went down hill
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> He will look at you a lot.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> it happens, once in a life time, twice if youre lucky.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> Only if you get his wife's permission first.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> If she can't skate, it's even better.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> Heck, I don't even think one can even SPELL <
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Sexiness is juz a thing that can help the person u love tobecome more inlove with u...
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_50> So what if she doesn't look like a runway model?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> maybe start walking with her daily.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> ask for it very nicely or give her foreplay so good shell beg you for it
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> people always like dreams than reality is it not?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> guy can also play with girl feelings if he is inteligent
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I want a person that I can trust.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> how bad does she want sex?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> Oh and never make her pay the bill lol [jk]
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> When you always think that person
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Damn that could have bein me.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> you can always do fall colors (lead with red but also oranges, yellows, browns, etc).
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> does he find ways to always touch you?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> If she is hanging with them alot, she might be trying to make you jealous.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> If you are in love you know it, if not you know it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> If you asked when, I say never...but then you're asking how...you have to pay i guess
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> I found true love and I hate being away from him.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> As for the yahoo ad... WHO CARES!!!??
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Girl, you are like flour....I knead you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> if it doesn't work out, you're not out alot of dough.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Once a cheater always a cheater
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Try to make it a fancy restaurant.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> THAT IS ALL THAT IS OUT THERE ARE STUPID GUYS.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> but it doesnt have to be as great and pretty as ur dinner.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> it's like asking why do we hate.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> because if a man treats me bad he can kiss well you know.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> The best would be to move on...it isn't always easy...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> If it does, I would like to know it myself!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> i think that will be cool!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> You gotta make a tough call.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> What is it with guys and breasts?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> its better not to do it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Even saying somthing in the wrong tone.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> Or just send him a note on a holiday!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> be glad hes being honest with you and tellin you instead of cheatin on you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> Its like being in love with love.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> you're best and only girl friend should be your wife.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Fighting for freedom and yet the one person they should trust stabs 'em in the back!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> New love equals new life.....Even friends and families love can help a little  ;)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> just jokingly, but that's just me.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> i think i've seen it on t.v.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> this boy is my worst enemy, but he has the biggest crush on me ever!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> i would hes got some issues behind that...he shouldnt be leaving his underwear around and real men were boxers
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> it could also be not his sexule preff you might do the mature thing and privatly ask him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> It'll make you look like a devil worshipper or something!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> And dont forget to keep eye contact!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> and when u see him u will know.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> just show him what u really fell be honest .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> GOODLUCK and remember it is a NEW YEAR make it a good one!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Well if he is just now getting his Divorce then he was NOT YOUR man.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> i am currently waiting and im a guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> Don't know never had ruff sex!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> or black dresses with deep red flowers - depends on how casual or formal your wedding is.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> lol.. so yeah.. size matters, but it don't have to be huge, just atleast average!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> (work, play, education, whatever you do).
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> 2-always be ready to try something new 3-spend more time together...go on dates
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> I really don't want surgery but I'm at my wit's end.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> If you know the guy is being abusive.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> Having your fav icecream or candy avail is always sexy and tasty.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> Love is crazy... and I LOVE IT!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> A little more than a friend but with a whole lot less meaning.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> A kind compliment.........taking her to lunch.......doing things that show her exactly how much you love her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> (and you know what i mean).
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Never have ONLY ONE  girl spinning.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> And it's not like they are ALL THAT.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_20> Browse yahoo personals...that's where I met my husband.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> because we didn't try being married
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> No because women don't appriciate a man just taking care of her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> thats the different in life between men and women.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> And then get mad when you don't want nothing more to do with them?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> he is the one who screwed up...kill it, its not luv..its ur ego.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> If he's messing around behind your back, and you don't like it, just dump him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Sweetie, you cant be in love with someone you don't know.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> stayed friends -thats all- for 6years.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> by expressing ur 'communications' with another 'miss'  :)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> THEY MUST HAVE SOMETING GOING ON!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> Maybe you have just bored him to death
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> when kissing breath hard and bit there lip gently
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> i dunno...if classmates doesnt work then i dunno.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> married and with a beutiful 2 year old.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> well, u know how it is with guys wanting to stay on top of it all, right?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> This works pretty good to (she won't think your player).
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> As you grow up date many girls and get lots of experience, Good Luck!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> I know if a woman climaxes with me, she probably wasn't with me.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> But it's bad if you go too fast.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> BY NOW YOU KNOW THAT CHICKS DIG TALKING...SO, GOOD LUCK!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> (I'm still the horny guy she married):-(
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> now once they conquared one, they move on to conquar another.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> IF HE RETURNS, THEN HE'LL STAY 4 EVER.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Make it romantic, unless you know full well she DOES NOT like romantic things.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> Even if other people feel it is wrong who cares about them?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> a bundle kisses with red rosees.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> someone to insist ,to come along with during my life.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> What happens if you get caught?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> i have tried everything because im very sexual.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> im more sexual then my husband.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> ask yourself: does he look at you differently than your other guy friends?
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> ur lucky that u r evn friends.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> well its ur fault in the first place.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> coming from a guy he probably has someone else and is using u as a friend w./ benefits
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_25> i would have to say YES!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> love doesnt have an age minimum!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> haha Talk to your husband, don't cheat.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> for woman to do rather than men!..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> i would take my wife out every other week.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> ( although that's good, too! )
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> I THINK THAT PUTS A WOMAN IN A POSITION TO RECEIVE A LOT OF CRITICISM
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> man is Jesse MCcartney, and girl is Britany spears.....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> (as much as I would want my gal to be that special)
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> Smart girls are fun to hang out with ... Smart girls are sexy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Get dressed up and go to a nice place and see how he reacts.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Don't do things that you dislike just to impress a girl.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> worse.....cause the courts would be full of couples gettin divorced...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> k..we get the fresh breath thing.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> And I care about him a lot... and I cheated on Darryl with Lou.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Because he's getting mad at me because I make more
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> its ok, becouse the older girls have more experience in sex and they can better satisfy u...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> You never really know whats going to happen unless you try...
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_40> All you have to do is look!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> That but I hope you good luck.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> You could just smell his dick.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> Don't forget, women go grey too!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> Not right then, but after a few days.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_30> well, dont tell her to get over herself!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> It worked for me (I got her phone number) then asked her out.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> good for him, but aren't you going to be there??
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> There are many things that bother u. so try to bother them.... love is jus one among many!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> colors i would avoid - pinks, purples, pastels.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> OTHERWISE GO ON THE WEBSITE THAT HE IS ON AND REPORT HIM AS AN ABUSER.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> There got to be a lot of guys out there who woes her.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> I found mine...it just took the courage to leave & believe I deserved better!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> you might have to look for larger built women.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> I dont really know but that sucks.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> Aww dang I knew I forgot to do something!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> Good Luck.....I think women are smarter than that...LOL
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> some like it big, some like it small and some even like both.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> umm maybe expensive drink for having good time
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> do the rings bearers walk before the flower girls?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> maybe when the children are old enough to be a ring bearer/flower girl
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> I hear some people play sport on weekends though.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Black men are beautiful....Keep trying I'm sure all women in MN arent like that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> i still love him but i dotn show it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> I told her she and he was full of it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> You should be enjoying it too!
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_35> NOT all men but some do.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> some win and some lose, yet it is how you deal with it that matters
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> I don't think it stands for anything.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Who told you that men don't look for a relationship?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> If he loves you so much that won't matter.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> Some women are just that way.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> but i was so flattered by this youger womans advances my physical will power just wasnt there.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> depends if your a jerk to them quess.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> (I, guessing thats what you had in mind?)
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> yea...you should ask her out...and since ur already friends....there is a WAY better chance that she will say yes.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_55> so everything you listed, if you mean a glance as in lust.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_15> Do all of us a favor, though...TAKE THIS PERSON DOWN!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> But never give a lady yellow roses-those are for your sick grandmother!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> and how do i tell my viego?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> So anyways this guy tried kissing me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> to some it is like scotch whiskey...you have to develop a taste for it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> cuz he wants too look at ur ass and he doesn;t like u 4 who u r.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> and why would I want a GIRL to be my BOYFRIEND???????!!!!!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> Is she willing to come to me?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> Depending on who she is, she might like some other stuff...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> your self esteam can not be that low.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Keep ur hair combed an look people in the eye.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> though after a while she really needs to have a good personality.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> if you are a teen ager go to a predominantly black high school.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> no, unless you count what was in my thoughts.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> a sad Christmas.. like if you're not with your loved ones.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Rip the band-aid off, as they say.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> and on the other hand a slim with over sized doesnt look impressive.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> For pregnant woman... it helps them alot because it makes it easier to have there baby.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Maybe he wants to cool things down a bit.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> Does he ever say I love you without you saying it first?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> Don't mess with things if he has a girlfriend.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> But DEFINITELY call him and tell him immediately that this is bothering you!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Maybe a holiday kiss would do?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Otherwise, just buy lotion, perfume, or body wash stuff like from victoria secret...every girl likes that!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> If I love her then I dont want anyone else really.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> we're not complicated...were just beyond ur knowledge of understanding!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> This man is all about himself!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you wouldn't want to be branded as a racist, right?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> Otherwise, just buy lotion, perfume, or body wash stuff like from victoria secret...every girl likes that!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> If I love her then I dont want anyone else really.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> we're not complicated...were just beyond ur knowledge of understanding!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> This man is all about himself!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> you wouldn't want to be branded as a racist, right?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> I know exactly what you mean about the black guys.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> IF YOU THINK HE'S CHEATING HE PROBABLY IS.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> But one thing to remember is that you get what you pay for!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> You must be one hot guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Now that song will be in my head all day!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> im talking about that emotional bull crap.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> as soon as he knocks someone up it's over.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> eat light drink a little smile and sleep then u'll dream of this woman
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> if u really love her, u should stay strong.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> If you are a mature person just ask him.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> Yeah, sorta what Fallon Chambers said.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_25> haha, yea if they are pot heads :-D
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> IF SHE DOESNT KNOW YOU THEN WHY DONT YOU TELL HER WHO YOU ARE?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> don't ever lose hope because they are just around.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> I HOPE SO:)  IAM NOT THAT OLD IAM ONLY 21.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> people cheat for all different reasons....some still love their partner but just can't seem to stop sleeping around.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> She went off on me saying that i lied.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> Excuse me, it sounds like she needs to get rid of you, thats B.S.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> There's lots of good women men just tend to over look them.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_15> WIFE OR CHILD BEATING IS REPULSIVE AND HAS TO BE DEALT WITH.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> ...if you're the single guy she's complaining to, well - this all sounds great.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> he didn't really care for you and he finally found his way out..
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Don't feel akeward not talking...they are just being sad and thankful that your there with them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> im not talking about gifts here.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> That means that Bob's friends can not ask you out, or date you (even if YOU chase them).
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Not if you keep looking under the couch
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> If a man is too big, it freakin hurts!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> you have to walk into it like you have nothing to lose!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> if they are mean, they might hate you forever.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> just cuz they're a guy doesn't make them obsessed.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> You don't have committment problems, you just haven't found a guy that is on your level.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> U HAVE TO ROAM OUT SIDE U CANT FIND ANY 1 SITTING IN UR HOME
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> and are they willing to change...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Trust me, I've met a LOT of girls off of the internet.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_50> like when u want her to be u gf
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> Only you can ever know what your dreams mean.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> in case of guys, guys like big(er) breasts.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> If true love existed why do so many soldiers cheat and get cheated on?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> u can buy perfume for him or u can ask him what he likes
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> if they like each other.NO PROBLEM
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Make sure you are completely shaved (NO STUBBLE!)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> Don't date dumb or evil women and you're golden.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> (you do want her married to a nice man, right?)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> It means she wants to go to a friggin movie!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> ofcourse, you take care of how you look.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_40> well, first of all, dont have sex with him anymore, act cold.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> and actually, figured out that you really do love your man.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> a Husband, a Boyfriend, that can provide & support her ... SEXUALLY & FINANCIALY!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> For a dear lover, get her lylacs or johnson grass or something like that.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> U can never rush or ever have 2 feel obligated 2.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> It's OK to seperate the two.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> I have no friends male or female cuz he don't trust them.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> in short it's all about self confidence.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> well short answer : I think I did obay my parents!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> but lots are and if he was cheating then he's not worth jack
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> that way you wont be alone in this.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Yes most of the boys always have sex on thier minds.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> they dont know how to get there feelings across without...acting like a little child
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> That's what I want in a man!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> If you would then try asking him to dinner.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> and on the other hand you know ur husband well.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Well..You will have to ask alot of people.. and get alot of different answers...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> But she sat and thought about how things could be if i had never told her.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> But really, and i know this sounds bad, but it is depending on your man's SIZE.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> omg that makes me pissed...i myself have dated a black guy and there is NOTHING wrong with it!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> yes there are many but all guys are not the same the best thing to do is ask them
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> i found my love....but i wanna know what people think love is.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> ok i've struck out many times by doin' this .
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> SO LOOK WHAT I'M DOING NOW??
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I never talked about hers but she did a lot with mine.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Sensitive guys have trouble approaching girls so fewer of them have girlfriends.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> so what is there to be worried about?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Or maybe you need to take more baths?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> i do miss him though...i miss how he used to hold me n never leave my side.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> If you just want to have sex go for it, but if you want something more!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I love him but I know I desrve better.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Some guys go through with it, some guys don't.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Honey, baby, sweetheart... you are being played.. BAD!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> just dont do it its a stupid thing to do and everyone gets hurt and offended.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> or I'm kissing you, not him, so shut up already.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> Sometimes I go off just because I hear my wife getting into it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> and how you project that to girls.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> classic red dresses with mango calla lillies as flowers.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> does he do things you ask him to do without the expectation of him actually doing it?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> But don't overdo it, the brooding thing I mean.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> it never hurts to just ask him to hang out
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> just depends on the dude actually
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> You just start hanging out, spending time together.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Some ppl are worth sacrificing everything for...others aren't.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> becuase he wants to smell what you had for dinner...if ur smart enough to figure that one out
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Is it true the once friendship becomes more, it is hard to go back being just friends???

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> If you have to ask, then you are not!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> LoL, What would be wrong with that?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> 3. does he truely love you for who you are?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> If he has trouble getting a job there, has family here he doesn't want to leave, etc.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> Yeah guys are really strange aren't we?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> If you have to ask, then you are not!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> LoL, What would be wrong with that?

<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> I feel like I dont want to be with anyone else.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> (and I say that meaning no offense.)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Once a cheater, always a cheater.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> well the moral issues shouldn't be a problem.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> yes but its really whats on the inside that counts
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> try this have him be the house dad and you work.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> I prefer Blondy with a brunette redhead
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> THATS THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO FOR HIM RIGHT NOW.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> It's just people, grrs & boyz.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> And who knows, If you like it, try it...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> whta is the right words that i should say to this kind of man?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> But he has to make his own mistakes.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> Kids have a funny way of picking up on things that are going on.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> Well... mom always taught me to never get mixed up with a girl who already had kids.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> Men think that love = sex and some men are not comfortable with that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> i let a guy know and leave the rest up to him.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> i think she's using u for ur dick and likes women.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Or is it true once a cheater always a cheater?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> The website NewFriends4U.com is a good start though
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> JUST BE THERE FOR HIM AND GIVE HIM YOUR SUPPORT.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> dont waste time with a girl who is basically playing you.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> Get some gift for her which she really likes in her life...

<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> But.. thats just what guys do.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> U will not be dating HER.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> go, hug him/her, and say....i love you darling.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> i want him back but i dont know how to ask.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> Feed him Italian food, get him slightly inebriated, take him where *you* wanna go.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Does he seemkind of controlling if he wants to do all this??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> If it ever happened again leave & dont look back.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Tell her what your hopes and dreams are for the two of you in the future.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> could be a whole host of things!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> i think u can flirt unintentionally, but if its purposfully i thinks not ok!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> You just know, it feels right.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> WE ONLY HAVE ENOUGH BLOOD TO WORK ONE HEAD AT A TIME
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> u should try touching her or hug her a little more!!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> If she blows you off without a chance, chances are she isn't worth is anyway.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> i dont know, but i really dont like them.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> i dont think so...its really all the same
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> thats ok relationships fail and you get some experience for when you try again.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> becaue u see ur self wise and never be mistake
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> YALL NEED TO SIT DOWN AND REALLY TALK ABOUT IT.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> A promise ring doesn't fix anything up for real... keep tryin Best of luck
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_10> anywhere thats fits the mood...want it..do it!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> the woman and ex brother in-law were freinds growing up in school.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> she has her child alive and for money she lies that her son is dead.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_10> And remember to write it down this time!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> My best friend is a girl.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> anywhere thats fits the mood...want it..do it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> the woman and ex brother in-law were freinds growing up in school.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> she has her child alive and for money she lies that her son is dead.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> And remember to write it down this time!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> My best friend is a girl.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> My wife is driving me crazy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> a guy wrot this it shoul make u think.....
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> just remember it takes two to play tango
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> not totaly committed...meaning your having an affair?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> If he is a guy, he has been thinking about sleeping with you for 5 or 6 years.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> act supercool do not play hard to get.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> There are ways around a cheating husband; believe me I KNOW!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> im SOOO... in love with this guy but what should i do???
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> I don't know why women get with guys that treat them like crap.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> This year I am asking everyone to by me household things like lumber...drywall....etc.....how old is he?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> tell him you like him and hope that he likes you too
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> women on the other hand only reach their sexual peak at a much later age...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> my wife and i were married this month after meeting online.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Try using pillows (under her butt).
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> because they look prettier than girls when they try.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> when the age difference makes the relationship illegal!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> :P  And im not even one of those overbaring and controling guys.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> The love of parents esp mother is the 'real' thing...so what is that about??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Because mostly use yahoo for chat purpose.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Then I don't go back there again.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> They can't get that if a man makes too little money.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> feelin' guilty about it so jus follow ur instinct, ok. good luck.Another thing, that prob.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> But I have to agree, they are not men, they are still boys!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> Do I diserve ur love ??
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Same difference.....Don't believe it, it's BS.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> Look if you are like most people you really don't have the money to spend anyway.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> forget him if he doesnt luv u.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> It matters wat your lover thinks.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> most likely she isn't in to you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Love is not lust but it sure does bring it on.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> I would be happy to pray for you consistenly!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> If you're happy and don't want the tax breaks for kids, etc.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> and last but sertanly not least has to love God!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> if you are doing it because you feel pressured or something like that, run the other way!
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_30> Having some control is good, but too much is BAD!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> If you are a guy the you are gross.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Any way, Who cares I would like you any way even if it was past your sholders !!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> yes i think it is wrong.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> i've been in a situation like this before.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Your girlfriend would be upset too if you had a girl pick you up!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> because most hot girls are idiots and just don't know it yet
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> my advice is to cool it and try to stay with one.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> So u also doing like that to me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> Personaly I would say though... BALD AND PROUD!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> sounds weird if u take it serious
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> Now i have a very nice husband of 13 yrs!!!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> So u also doing like that to me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Personaly I would say though... BALD AND PROUD!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> sounds weird if u take it serious
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> Not someone else, even if ther worth it.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> Now i have a very nice husband of 13 yrs!!!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> it's the only thing that you know is going to happen in your life for sure
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Now i feel like were not friends any more.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Girls want that challenge thats the same for a guy too.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> Then yes, we ain't gonna get it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> it's the only thing that you know is going to happen in your life for sure
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_10> Now i feel like were not friends any more.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> he said 6 i said an hour he said a month.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> Girls want that challenge thats the same for a guy too.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> Then yes, we ain't gonna get it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> no  you  cant  make  anyone  do  anything  that  dont  want  to  do
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> but i suggest u to keep ur love in ur heart and atleast live happily for ur family.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> I was looking at a guy in my class.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> If they come back to you it's meant to be!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> Some guys don't like people rushing them.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> Lots and lots and lots of hard work.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> no u can not cuz its not stong enough s p r e m
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> (If you could, I would've by now)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> I'm not happy, everything i try to achieve looks impossible...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> If he cheats once, he will surely cheat again.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> YOU KNOW YOU GO TO A PARTY AND WE YOU START TO DANCE WITH THEM.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Does he talk bad about his ex?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> My boyfriend of 3 1/2 years cheated.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> And I don't mean hair and eyebrows.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> a gurl should like you for being who you are.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> All i would have to say is something nice,pretty, and say that u like her alot.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> So, thats why they cant profit from it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> doews he want to be w/ me or are these hints to back off?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Walk up to her and say Hi, I'm so and so.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> you met him/her first, made friends with him/her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Oh, and don't go crazy like Anna Nicole Smith ;)  haha.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I soppose you care about her, don´t you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Take it and run with it........he isn't for you unless you like selfish men.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i mean, i know youre supposed to ply them with boone's farm.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Why are u in the middle?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> Oh, and don't go crazy like Anna Nicole Smith ;)  haha.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> I soppose you care about her, don´t you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> Take it and run with it........he isn't for you unless you like selfish men.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> i mean, i know youre supposed to ply them with boone's farm.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> Why are u in the middle?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> I never got to tell him exactly how I felt.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> for sex, fat girls will do just about anything you ask, sexual depravity know no bounds.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> not just for yourself but for the children too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> he doesn't want me to go back.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well you have to let them know you're interested either by telling them or flirting with them.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> because alot of girls now a days want to be wild , or they want your money lol.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> AND SOMETIMES KIDS ARE WANT THEIR PARENTS TO STAY 2GETHER
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> You don't know because you don't see what's wrong with you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> you can flirt with me anytime  lol
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> don't let the spirit of embarrasment to over shadow u, talk it out!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> because alot of girls now a days want to be wild , or they want your money lol.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> You don't know because you don't see what's wrong with you.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> you can flirt with me anytime  lol
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> till the time they feel to get rid of each other
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> i think i miss that same party lifestyle but having never had it im not sure what im missing.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> I asked him if he liked it and fortunately he did.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_15> Movie tickets + popcorn and drinks for 2
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> the other person climaxes or stops too soon?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> i think i miss that same party lifestyle but having never had it im not sure what im missing.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> I asked him if he liked it and fortunately he did.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_10> CHEATING IS DANGEROUS AND IF YOU STAY HE'LL KNOW THAT HE CAN KEEP DOING IT
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> You are young and will find someone else because you sound like a good, descent person.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> If she says it's cool, it's cool.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> he talks to me alot but i dont know what to think
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> well  just talk to her and tell her there is nothing bad in having an orgasm.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Men...SEX and only sex...no room for anything else!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> always be gentle, unless she likes it otherwise.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> girls, like guys, want what they can't have.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> so what u need to do is to tell him exactly how u feel--because he might not know.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> Find me with a foreign especially American girl friend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> and that is something that will never change no matter what.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD MEET NEW GUYS.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> last monday, she said me she was very sick.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> That said, sexuality is not as ridgid as people think it is.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> If you're not willing to discuss it with her, I guess you'll just have to forgive her...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> (even if only in their own eyes:)
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> liz gave you a very good answer
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> If we did, you would be cooking right now and not on the internet asking dumb questions!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> because the only two are gay.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> well what do u want to do?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> jus to cover d gals.........they jus show am havin lots of money.....simple
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> :) Ask about his life, etc
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> 2. then you counsult doctor for testube baby.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> ITS SO HARD WHEN YOU WEAR YOUR HEART ON YOUR SLEEVE.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Know something it's great to be married & there is a person to share your feelings, love, pain etc...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Even if this is your own mother!
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_35> good luck and i hope i helped!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> and give him a friendly little peck on the lips.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> At least 16 or possibley older?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> Ask her if just being friends online or on the phone is ok, as a friend.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> Once again, I do not mean to offend anyone.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_45> l need someone in my life
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> i think its because you can help others better than u can help yourselves.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_15> U CAN LOVE ALOT OF PPL BUT U CAN ONLY FALL IN LOVE ONCE
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> at first it like youre floating on clouds and you only see the good things about him/her.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> there no way to tell asking just that question.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> doesn't really matter what its the thought that counts
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> who knows maybe he'll end up liking your best friend that thinks she's so hot...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Don't try to guess her feelings.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Of course, you got to do it right, you know.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> keep in mind meaness is often from insecurity...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> TO me I dont get it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Marriage vows state that husbands come first.... period.... you know what you gotta do, so do it.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> YOU CAN CERTAINLY FORGIVE, BUT THE HELL IF YOU CAN FORGET
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Now I am in 8th grade and he is a sophomore in HS.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I have heard Dr Drew on Love line talk about this one a lot
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> and i like nice nerdy girls.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> For one, props to what Richard said up there.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> if he is having sexual problems he should be talking to you about it, not that other woman.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> has he ever lied to u, even about little things?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> wow honestly that si your decission but yeah.....it depends on how far you love her??
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> i think u better give room to those who love u very much then u love some1.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> maybe he thinks you are a freak or desperate for trying to find true love on the internet
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> plant a bug on his bedroom
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> n i just dont know whether he ll ever be my guy or not!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> so dont waste your time on a woman, move on to another.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> hair is what makes a man sexy.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> But if it really bothers you, just talk tohim
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> sorry is hardest word but gudbye is the very difficult
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> will if you give her what she want you know take her out to a movies,restrarant,hotel and you know.......
<NbChars_250> <LevSim_35> take just as much as u give

<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> why would you have to call first?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> but first if your husband doesnt know - tell him - if he does tell him anyways.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Unless the guy doesn't want you to.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> not all love is meant to be
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> I feel horrible, but I don't want to go back into this relationship, but I really feel heartbroken..advice?????????????????????????
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> and it depends on how old you are.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> I like take him to whatever lookz like fun in town.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> Let romance take its course...it does still work!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> It hurts... because it's our fault, guys I mean.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> I feel horrible, but I don't want to go back into this relationship, but I really feel heartbroken..advice?????????????????????????

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> and you'll know when youre ready!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> Basically, be carefull, & don't let him&#92;her interupt your work duties & you SHOULD be fine.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> The key her is practice and get confidence so that you don’t mess up with the one you want.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> there isn't one answer to this question.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> So I just don't do it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> and you'll know when youre ready!

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> the rhythm isnt quite right for you?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> no, if it's not a good date, no need to kiss.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> ask him to marry you - see what happens!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> to hell with that...put your faith in yourself...seek what you desire and demand reciprocity.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> Once a cheat, always a cheat!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> you dont have to be married to make a family for your kids..if the dad will still stick around.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Or he may act like he love your kids just to screw u and go on his merry way.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Try to convince her that u are not going to cheat her daughter.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> so you need to put out better or do better acts and he wil llike you better
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> CHECK IT OUT WITH YOU DOC
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> the side of your personality your boys will never see
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> surprises never seem to work out!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> I like a girl touching me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> its actually good to do that.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> MEN SHOULD BE RUGGED, STRONG MEN.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Torn between two lovers?Feeling like a fool?Loving both of them is breaking all the rules!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> if you really like her alot but first you might want to check her looks
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Well, if he can't let go, then you have to let him go.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> BECAUSE THAT HAVEN'T MADE UP THEIR MINDS YET.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> They don't sleep with EVERY guy .

<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> Thanks for your advice to my vacation question!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> most defenitely ur not asking for too much.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> They should be up by 12/16/2005
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> And with most guys they cant tell exactly when there about to come no way.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> If you are my student...um...call me?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> You blew it with this one.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> it is just nations arguing (?)
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_40> Or your Mom asks at Christmas dinner.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> if ur a chick and dig chicks
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> Try to tell her what the other things that concern you about marrying him.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> Oh, and if you can cook.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> well this is a it depends matter.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> havent been there but dude its been 3 months already...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> Females from other black seem to love...HUH??
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> should i talk to him, or see if he talks to me?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> If he would hurt u that deeply twice in one life time, thats too much!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I just have to ask this, Cause I have to know!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> tell her i like u more than a friend , i love u will u except my proposal ?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Don't let go of hope, Hope gives you the strength to keep you going!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> This is a frequently asked question on Y!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> They will then tell you !
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> - plus have you thought about your HEALTH???
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> I like this guy at work a lot.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> then sometimes she will show what ur missing....like maybe bend over so you can see her butt or something.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_10> THEN DON'T F**K AROUND WITH SOMEONE TO WHOM YOU ARE NOT MARRIED!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> If she's not the right girl, that should be a big clue.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> then back to giving her the attention again.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> for me i think they r interested in sex more than being love in the adolescence
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> He's going out with my friend now but I think there's still a chance!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> Must you really ask this question anyway???
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> Sex is for the marriage bed only!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> ears,  women love ears, dont know why
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> well,my opinion is if u have trust in your boyfriend,then u wouldn't have to worry about flirtation!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> cuz we cant dance and its evil to make us dance cuz we are clumsy and stupid
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> just tell him as soon as possible.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> don`t rush it men don`t like to be rushed on a empty stomac
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> DONT DEGRADE YOURSELF HES WITH YOUR FRIEND DO GO BACK FOR LEFT OVER LEFT OVERS
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> ask questions ..dont discuss religion..sex..or politics.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> SAD BUT TRUE  Being something your not is a hard thing to keep going.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_20> its simple they all think u r sexy and hot.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_15> heres a SECRETE THAT MEN HAVE PASSED OIN FOR GENERATION TO GENERATION.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> Well I'll just say this- Keep it real if you guys are always talking just ask.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> Your kids come first no matter how old they are....SUPPORT YOUR KIDS!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Let the guy chase the girl.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Yes.And whenevr I feel like showing love, I kiss her
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> ...or driving you crazy NOT wanting sex?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> people change grl frnds.. every week!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Ha.. good question... now I know what to tell my girlfriend I want.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> If he ever had his hair short (like when you first met him?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> What should i do ive tryed every thing!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> dsease because i hate to see babies suffer.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> Do you mean the guys you have dated?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> Think about yourself first and his feelings second.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> honstely it all depends on the girl.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> THey could not wait until they became GROWN.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> you already have it in your head to find each persons faults and downfalls.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> i am not even sure if she would like me to ask her or not.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> The kind that gets other good things going !!!!!!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> Like it is a one way street.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> i l ask her whats this proposal about??
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> because some sup or vid models like average guys because they keep it real.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> its alot better once u relax and just have fun, its not so serious.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> cmon, u will find someone that want u as ur self!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> i am pretty sure he is hiding something and he does not want you to know what it is.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> definitely take her to small claims court.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> he said he was going to back to his home state with or without me.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> lol maybe you should hold your breath when giving a guy head so you don't suffocate.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> ever try talking to one to see if you like them and vice versa.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> Hints are BS...  Just say what you mean and stop assuming people are getting the hint...
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> Jeez... this guy could be a fake.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> A friends mother gave her this advice..be careful who you date, you just might fall in love with them.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> well the big question that i have is do you work as well?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> ALTHOUGH, U KNOW THAT MEANS GIVING UP UR OWN; NO MATTER HOW BAD AND HOW LONG U HURT.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> If she does things that you don't like around, quit being her friend.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> Your wife and her feelings or a friend?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> People don't know because they don't see what you see.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> I dun trust and i dun sleep...no ways!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Probably because no one is there to tell them not to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> is he more friendly and touchy feely with u or is he just that way with everyone.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> What the heck is her problem?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> And honestly, why wouldnt a guy want a young beautiful woman?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I meet a girl on phone, we become very good friends.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> then i got a loaf of bread.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> i mean im a guy, im not judging, but.. what would happen if you asked them the question?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Jokes aside... no reason not to meet unless he is not who he says he is.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> u might find out later you lost the perfect one.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Nice guys dont like nice girls.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> The same things that unattractive women like!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> I'm 51 so it is very hard.But gotta DO IT.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> The way i look at it, if its meant to be its meant to be.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> well it is not a turn off if you have children and it is.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> If they are in love and there are no showstoppers then go for it.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> meaning, you got her attention so go and propose!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Take her an run to the bed..LOL
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> it's been like that from day one in my house since both of us work.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> spank the monkey if you have to but remember.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> Hit it and move on your tooooo young.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> try asking her what she likes.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> You just go ahead be proud...She is a Pro player...Merry Christmas
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> do you two hold a friendship?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> dont waste time thinking of ur old one
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> get around the corner and fill your belly.............booze or food........but as you know, booze is never good.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Then she saw that I didnt care, so she went for it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I just admire the womans facial beauty and her good looks
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> How do I make it special?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> You ever gave them a chance?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> if you find that guy you'll be happy and it will last.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> make sure u r gonna be able to understand each other
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Might intimidate boys, but never men.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> My ex-boyfriend's sister and i used to be really close.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> yea it does on my girl
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> THEN WHEN THEY ARE ON THE DANCE FLOOR THEY FEEL INTIMADATED......
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> let time tell you weather you do or not.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> coz he is known to be liking a girl who s very bad, showy (n fairer than me!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> give them a little bit to disipher that feeling.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Forgive her for what she did to you, get your man, and move on!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> whatever happend to prayer in school?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> (The funny thing is that I know all these thing, but I don't have a girlfriend.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> you haven't found the right one.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> first off, your kids should be your priority.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_45> What kinds of things are you into??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> The same way you always have!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> If deep down inside he's an a hole then it might work but it's seldom worth it...trust me
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> i said i would quit my teaching job and go too.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> it all depends on the guy.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> mmm.... nice question but u didnt tell about ur charactor.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> If deep down inside he's an a hole then it might work but it's seldom worth it...trust me
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> i said i would quit my teaching job and go too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> it all depends on the guy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> mmm.... nice question but u didnt tell about ur charactor.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Hrm..  Why not be friends with him and just be friends.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> I have trouble with girls in the past, alot so if you can help me out...it would be nice.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> no, he doesnt love you beyond your body.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> never stop smiling, because you never know who's falling in love with your smile!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Am I going to get hurt?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> u can start with a punch line.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> there is a generation gap between the 2 of you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Why wont you ask her out?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> also when they have very sexual realtions towads each other then they are lesbian!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> most important thing is dont give up!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> But reality is, that it would be like dating your mother.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> what if the guy turns out to be a total jerk?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> it seems he don't care.... if i were in your shoes, do the same way...
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> So, how do I do the start ?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> Once more into the breech my bro!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> It's like having your cake and eating it too.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> ...I'm going with One's answer....vote for One  vote for One
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> it is not always true though.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> if you meet and know him well /for a long time, yes you could do it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> well it depends on how much you love her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> im a good girl but i have to admit that the bad boys definately can take ahold of you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> shower a gurl with all your attention.. then after a while ignore her.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> I am very shy and so, I am not able to ask her !!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> And sometimes I felt like I was having chest pains!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> dont act crazy or stupid, just be yourself
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> Remember, there are no ugly women, some just are barely pretty.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> for the same reason men don't like women have male freinds.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_20> I'M A MAN, AND I CAN'T ANSWER THAT WITH SURTENLY.WHAT IS SEXY?
<NbChars_260> <LevSim_40> men alway want to be right, even when wrong.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> do you mean how to get a boy to like you?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> I never heard from him again until christmas day nearly 2 years later i learned that he had died.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> just flirt with them and wear ome cloth that will make u look sexy!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Bring a red rose and go somewere that she likes
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> and some taste better then others.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_10> ask her out take the risk man
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> If you really love her that much, ask her to marry you.

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> im in the same boat, i have been dating a guy for 2 weeks.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> you could type in his / her yahoo id and search for the person.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Breath a little bit deeper once in a while.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> as if they dont even have to accept it.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> Looks like your in a hard spot and it also looks like hes in a hard spot.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> -- OK, so you aren't my student...but same answer.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> I used to feel the same earlier...

<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> it all depends....i am a guy with a punkish attitude but down inside im a nice guy.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> Well, I am not sure exactly what a surrendered wife is...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> People always love talking about themselves even if they act like they don't.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> I THANK THAT IF THE GUY IS REALLY IN TO THE WOMAN HE SHOULD CALL 1ST:) GOOD LUCK
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_35> yeah yeah go and tel her

<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> do the best and as a simple man, bro!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And the next day, you find out that your relationship is over, from Yahoo!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> BE FUNNY,TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE INTERESTING,AND THEN TAPE 20 DOLLAR BILLS ON YOUR BODY.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> if not dont worry if you do or dont have a guy.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> your are the forth who ask this question :(
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> or am I just to paranoid?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> guys can never go wrong w/ a woman if they give her jewlery.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Women, you can't have it both ways.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> ...  and then they would still think about it for a moment before they said 'no'.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> and you say your young too well if thats the case its kinda suppose to be like that.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_70> start with heavy petting, move to cunilingus.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> thats the first step, i suppose.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> I love a man in Boxer Briefs!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> that sounds really wierd and dumb but define what U think  an online realitionship is...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Most women will never ask a guy out.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> you can check the yellow pages ...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> I DON'T MEAN TO MAKE YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE, AND I'M KIND OF NERVOUS.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> right after the date or on it
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_60> not in mid MI, Clare area
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> (Guys hate it when they feel that they are being nagged at!)
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> no because if you really love someone, how will you have room to be in love with anyone else?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> why would u want 3 g/f's?
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_30> yes, go talk to your doctor.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Also remember that the wife is always right!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> It is like losing a love one.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> anyway,e-mail back when u get a chance.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> disclose everything u want......lets make list out here
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> he wants to be able to watch football and have sex with his gf or spouse.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> i can only find this poart of the quote...but im looking for the whole thing!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Your virginity is very special, and should be saved for someone you really care about...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> try to go to partys and stuff he might be at.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> there are lots of women out there that will be interested in you.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> go at it in a church
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Love is not sex - that is lust.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_25> so remember not to rush it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> You've said it, but do you MEAN it?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> 11 with a card sayin that she/he completes the dozen!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> Also a lot of people who don't want someone their with also don't want that person with anyone else.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Is two dozen twice as nice or is it just overkill?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> Did you get off to it?
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_25> he said i could be a housewife.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> If deep down he's a nice guy, it won't work.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> now i got a job offer in a whole new state for a job i don't like.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> DON'T TELL HER THAT YOU ARE PLANNING ON STAYING WITH YOUR WIFE , SHE WILL ONLY BE BITTER.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> stop and ask her for directions or something and just start up a conversation
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> if ur family does like ur girlfriend and ur girlfriend does'nt like your family.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> ), her fate is already sealed.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> because boys cheat on the girls and we know how it gos!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> That is a bad sign bro
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> love all, as if you are loving god.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> Get a picture first and send her yours.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> If that's their answer, they probably don't.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> Especially when most people suck at it!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> i think if the guy is in to you he should call at laest every other day.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> What is a major reason for people straying...BOREDOM WITH THEIR PARTNER!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Nobody does, unless they're psychic or something
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> no, it scares them but later makes them confident, if not arrogant later on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> if girls wanted it as much as guys we wouldnt get very far as a society.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> I never act embarrassed / ashamed to be with him.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> dont be scared the color of her blood pumpin through her body is the same as yours.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> I don't want any drama, i just want my dress back.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> even he agrees that i m a nice , good friend of his.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if that is so.. tell her that reaching climax will not affect that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> That's how it goes, I guess.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> FREE TO DO AS I PLEASE
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I love this girl very much but i have no idea how to start!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Then he sits around alot playing Palystation 2.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> you know when you know there no real way to say it just something you know
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> At an early age , well 16, I decided that I wanted adventure in my life.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> And make sure she doesn't read any beauty or celebrity magazines!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> Does it matter if he is what you call gay?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_10> U DONT SPEND ENOUGH TIME ON YOUR KNEES.AND OR BENDING OVER THE KITCHEN TABLE..START DOIN IT!!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> you cant make someone love you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> I dont really understand your question that good but it seems like youve been attracting young guys??
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> but the ring on my finger is enough.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> Hey and I said Oh, hi, C. What's Up??
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> i have seen this happen way too many times; get out of there before things escalate out of control.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> i understand that and i respect him enough to not do it.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> who care what they look like it is all about there personality.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> Then again she may have intimacy issues, i guess u'll never know.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> its hard to even find that these days let alone take care of a woman.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Could the ones you are trying to dance with be Hoosiers, bu chance?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> offer little gifts seldomly and tell jokes to her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> My grr did the same thing, then left when I told her to get a j.o.b.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> If you don't already know, ASK YOUR MOTHER!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Takes these facts and ask yourself, am I a freak, or am I a super freak?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> Then that'd be perverted or vice-versa!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> Depends if you really believe in love .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> Plus I found out she just doesn't call people back very much anyway.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> go to the member directory of all of the yahoo members
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> Maybe you should try some dating websites, like yahoo perosnals or someone other ones.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> but we mostly forget that and let the bird runs away .
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> BC THEY LOVE HIM AND DO KNOW HOW TO GET OUT OF THE MARRIAGE?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> SO.. practically married, just no paperwork.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Eather through note or e-mail.Not unless she likes  it when u ask in person.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> She was scared I wouldnt like it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> single mothers can't leave house.... or are too lazy
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> Most men are interested in younger women!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> wht do u have 2 do?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> but remember to keep your eyes open and dress nice.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_50> single mothers can't leave house.... or are too lazy

<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> Pretend like you don't know she exists.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> because, after all, they are better than other people and they can get away with it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> no i think it,s a bad thinking to sleep with some you dont care about
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> my boyfried and i have been togeth for 6 years
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Just about drove my husband crazy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> i would agree with wat nichole says.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> they think about how good the women looks
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> just dont take it to far.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> ...They both know, and he is always nice to me, but she hates me.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> I mean, I'm not even the one she said it to & I'm offended!
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> Never change just for a guy.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> then call her and ask her if you guys can talk.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> WOMEN CHEAT AS WELL, NOT JUST MEN.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> if it wasnt, u'd just be friends.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> not one of these sites that dirct you to pay porno sites .
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_30> Okey kids Listen Up...the waterfall with great....we looked great...But the only thing you could hear WAS THE DAMN WATERFALLING....!!!

<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> Some are okay with it, others are not.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> No, there is little chivalry here.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> trust me..i no:)or call him  he will want to talk... ;)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> i said what ever you have to say say it now.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> Although I think it'd be kinda difficult!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> and your partner will not doubt you wether you are lying or cheating to him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> ( if you get this message please respond.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> every woman has a taste... no matter how clean they are.

<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> a marriage is both the hardest job you will ever have & the most satisfying.

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> If you find that perfect man then let me know.

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> but thats only for outgoing people.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> I think that if you have sex with 10 guys or with only 1 --it shouldnt matter.

<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> where did you get that, do you know..., nice dress..
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> i would have to say 2 dozen b/c the more u buys u roses the more he like/loves you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> because married men are more mature..they already know how to handle relationships and they have more experience
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> How long ago was the breakup and what were you so jealous of?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Im still trying to find that out for myself if you find out tell me!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Just don't let them get that close.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> I always thought once people were engaged they were SURE!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> i don't really want to start something, but i still have a grudge with her from four years ago.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Hey there,  nice to know you love the girl.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> Your best bet, if you like him, is to flirt with him and then see if he responds.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> love is a feeling but feelings are not love.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> find a girl u want to go out with and without thinking much about it ask her out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> you might find on that u fancy and stick with her the rest of the remaning year.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> love to see full big ones, pretty sexy eyes, not butch looking
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> or maybe hes never thought of you in that way.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> i live in ohio and i dont see much chivalry either.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> if u have summ thing in common use it
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> what would she do if her son were to really die.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> He however, always quits or gets fired from one job to the next.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> im not even sure how he feels about me.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> Get out of the house once in a while!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> THEY were the one to cheat, remember?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> had anyone in love with 2 sister at once?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> like saying all that suppose to change the way i feel about them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> Watch out for the sound on your....video tape...Better Luck too you!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> Well...I love getting new jeans and/or underwear.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> being married is becoming one.....you have to give and take
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> i think he just needed someone to feel sorry for him.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_50> make sure that you are the one.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> (I am blind in ONE eye) ..
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> If both of yall aint tryin to make it worth anything it wont' be worth nothin.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> you get that felling in your stomach that when you know
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> the moment we see a gr8 girl, we feel we are in love, but then that is just infatuation.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> if he is telling you he dosent like you , suggest some time apart.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> he is not interested in your.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> kempie.....what the hell is up with the train analogy??
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> like i said men think differently than we do, give him time he may come around.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> there is know h thinking about it u just feel it.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> It would be even worse if i didn't know the guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> just say that u really liked her for a while and she will do the rest
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> well anyway, just don't close the door, give them a chance to prove their worth.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> That other guy didn't answer the question right.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> I know way too many really beautiful girls who think they don't look good...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> ... maybe he just has a sis who hogs the phone all the time.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> Oh yeah, helps that I'm a hottie!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> Yeah you know you are, jus go with it!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> Yes and no, maybe she didn't get the message?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> im only 13... but still... if he didnt?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> it depends on the realtionship between me and her but mostly i'll not sleep if a little bit doubt

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> coz those who r the one who helped u to come all the way.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> yes, it matters more than it does for a guy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> - and 'accidentally' bump into her.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_55> He's young, and a young man- is going to be a young man.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Say im sorry bla bla bla bla bla do u forgive me?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> When you can't do anything else but think about spending the rest of your life with her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> If your not having sex it because she choose this not you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> Sometimes you gotta play the game to stay ahead.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> I dont get it... youre supossed to be wrong, you know?..
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> I keep thinking she'll be back.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> and forget him, & enjoy your love.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> try yahoo email search, for one.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> People like and want what they can't have.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> I buy my wife flowers every couple of weeks.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> u will beable to tell them apart once u actually meet a mature guy which would be hard
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> Ignoring it doesn't mean that they hate you.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> i kissed my date on the first date.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> if a guy were going to ask me out i would like to know the guy really well.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> i also have an infatuation for an elder girl.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> if you have to ask, maybe it is not love
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> There really is some nice, single guys left out here!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Don't ask a girl out in a message.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> so it basically means that if you want returns you have to take the risk.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> And no- I'm not talking about sex, either.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Well, you COULD try asking your wife.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Think of things you know he likes to do.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> why won't she ask me out?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> disease...because innocent people get that too.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> sorry i just want to know how many girls ever got this line or how many guys gave it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> Ah leave em alone...   People learn by getting bit....Hondo Lane.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> And what if it doesn't work out?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> I don't mean with war either.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> If you are a chick then that is awesome to do.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_10> what if you like this person.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Ah leave em alone...   People learn by getting bit....Hondo Lane.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> And what if it doesn't work out?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I don't mean with war either.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> If you are a chick then that is awesome to do.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> what if you like this person.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> try telling her that u felt in love but never tell her who ... then follow her reaction
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> Just remember, in the long run, which is more important: your friendship with her, or a crush?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> That would be so uncool, right?
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_20> I only have 5 and women never complain.
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_20> I'm 27 yr old, 6ft, not white

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> i don't want a divorce or to live without/away from my husband.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Love is what makes sex great!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i dont want to get hurt either.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> i no there are good people out there just be careful
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> mmm Well when you get older you will find out :)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> What you need to do is learn to trust your man.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> i still like having the door opened for me and i love my feminity.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Either case, you gotta let her know, wouldn't it suck if she got away because she didn't know??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> I hope you get caught on asking that question...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Im sure he would love to help!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> If you truly think he is cheating .....he most likely is...........good luck.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> 7 years are enaugh , to understand alot of things in life .

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> I cheated 2 times, THE BIGGEST MISTAKE OF MY LIFE  Never Again Will it happen.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> why not try to seduce him?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> sounds like you should not be engaged.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_10> BUT EVERY SENCE THE NEW KID CAME HE TOOK OVER!!!!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> like they say, if you love someone, set them free.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> lets just say i wont ever forget it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Hopefully she misses you as much as you miss her!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> girl, i have been there done that.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> more of the same stuff you probably already talked about during the date.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> Good luck and keep your chin up!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> they even want to marry me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> If you're not in love with her, then don't stay.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> sound like a little single time is what your in need of.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> Almost every state has great looking girls, but I dunno, I'm gonna say Texas

<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> just enjoy and go with the flow!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> use your eyes and your ears and then you gonna find out,remember not all the ladys are the same.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Some men like to spoil their gals.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Even though I'm married now and not looking for anyone, I still laugh at the pick up lines, etc.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> That's, like, so awesome, like, amazing & like, the best, and like, so sad all in one!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I don't think it is 'wrong' at all.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Picking up girls is not all that different.)

<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> Just sit back and keep doing what you are you doing.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_30> Nothing like big hair, fake nails, and lycra to get a guy going.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> I don't know but someone tells you write it to me cuz I want to know to
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> Life wouldnt be life if everyone was prefect.. im not sayin what he did was right!!

<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> Remember its for better or worse!

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> YOU NEED TO MAKE HER WANT IT DONT ALWAYS GIVE IT TO HER WHEN SHE WANTS IT.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> God created man`s Head unlike womans- seldom it match- AND IFF?
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_25> But only if u can handle whatever answer you get.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> or go on a date w/ ur husband or go 2 a concert.

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> By the way why did he leave you?

<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Get a penpal thats a girl thats your age!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If your still in love why would you move on?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> No to going to other girls.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> (FOUND OUT THE HARD WAY...BROKEN HEART 4 12 YEARS.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> There is no US law that says they can't.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> if thats the case keep trying... thats how my boyfriend and i ended up together..
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> Its nice to get the family seal of approval though, so I wouldn't wait too long.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> becuase you also have the chance of not gettig hurt and being happy
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> just watch their actions and listen to what and how they say things!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Dont let anyone tell you different.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> 13 Herb Bath) and get on  with your life.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> hehe maybe u must get warm him first:P
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> this guy might want to kiss you but he needs time to find the right moment.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> they just don't want to admit they were dumb enough to get caught.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> I hope this helps and best of luck to you in the future!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> *In Philly, I like the restaurant MORIMOTOS.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Well the guy I met kissed me on the first date and I thought it was awesome.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> may be you good nature & good looking they fill better to live life with you
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> It's so easy to marry the wrong person.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> i too got married early but we didn't have kids.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> u have to find a real love than never care about being tall or not ....
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> Don't let yourself be hurt any more!!!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> if he goes to a party, ask if u can go with him
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> no, thats true, i've had that too.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> You cant make anybody love you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> And then you roll your eyes and sigh and say, nothing, and storm off into the kitchen.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> Try a little trick I heard on the radio.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> 1st, you hafta be open with him.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> this keeps happening to all of us (guys) all the time.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> redefine hot girl.. i think girls that are mean aren't really hot...hokey?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> If she's picky, she will not be happy no matter what you give her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> Guys don't pick up on hints as fast as women do.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> (no dumb pick up lines but if you want one that never fails get a hold of me)
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> guys(not all guys) want it more than  girls because sex is more important to you, sex is your priority.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> Well I like when girls have eye contact with me.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> If you brave it and ask her, that's gonna be a plus.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> but sometimes ; we live too long in paradise , until we don't feel it , any more !
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> whole new bunch of problems (ones people dont talk about in public)maybe.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> if so is it better to have multiply orgasms or one big orgasm?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> What did you like about it there?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> If Demi can why can't we...LOL  Go for it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> if its there you will know but hold out on her a little
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> But that just my plug nickel's worth.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> be yourself because will like u being urself.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> That is all i have to say!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> In general, if guys want sex, women want romance.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> personally i dont like a girl to have kids.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> She & I wound up dating & then we got married.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> Tell her exactly what you said in your question.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> if u have a house or will someday have one get her something for it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> I am not a person for that like that u tell to ur boyfriend
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If you want to talk let me know!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> by the way.. he is very very very stubborn!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_90> The one I know is loyal and I can count on.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> [Unless the woman forces it ;) 'I have never thought of you like that']
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> i would call her every day  but not too much  so that i dont step on her nerve
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> this guy is just bringing home the drama y even bother?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> I wouldn't take it to much to heart, just be happy in the fact that you're really hot ;)
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> 2. do the two of you have experience in solving disagreements well?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> Stay there, while the staying is good, unless they are abusive in some way, then it isnt true love!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> How do you get your dog to roll over?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_20> Why can't you ask her out?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> if your into it then go for as many as you want and can get.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> but you have to regardless of how hard it may seem.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_15> I wouldlike to know your answere dud, question like that means you have something to say about it, right?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> How do you get your dog to roll over?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Why can't you ask her out?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> if your into it then go for as many as you want and can get.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> but you have to regardless of how hard it may seem.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> I wouldlike to know your answere dud, question like that means you have something to say about it, right?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> Maybe she got ate up by zombies
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> if you can wait then do..
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> One night he called me on a break from work & was really depressed...just having a terrible day.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Ask her to get up and clean the house
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> The second rule - saying ANYTHING is better than saying NOTHING.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> and i would say for you to do the same.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> nothing i have read or anything, just my own personal opinion...  anyway, i hope that helps answer your question.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_10> THEY ACT LIKE YOUR KILLING THEM

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Girls love a guy with confidence.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> so if she is looking around the room instead of you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> i then think you are a rainbow warrior.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> dont worry their is a special place in hell reserved just for you for even thinking about cheating.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> For guys to bond, they have to do stuff: billiards, bowling, drinking, partying, sports, etc.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> i want to see aishwraya rai's toes
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> ask your mate..its only cheating if it would upset them.

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> One reason (for me anyway) it really turns guys on.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> If you dont love him, then dont lead him (or you) on any longer.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> cause it's one way of being honest to him no matter what.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> i suppose you could let him treat you like a queen if he thinks you are
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> And, I'm just getting started here...........
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> hope u got a good lawyer...lol
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> might be he is feeling lonely.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> a soulmate is nothing more then someone that you want to be with for the rest of your life.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> Or a gay women thinking a man is hot?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> You left this question kinda late, didn't you?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> if you feel you need a wedding... do it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> why you gotta be all up in my grille about my attitude?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> tell her that ur father in law will watch over her
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> depends who starts it...if u did, an apoligy is nice, ..
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> But i think it is healthier to live a LIFE full of LOVE... after all, you go both ways...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> I prefer blonde , and i don't know why !
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> Hi, I go to an Academy and there's a woman I like.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> why arent u comfrotable with talking about sex?
<NbChars_280> <LevSim_30> just walk up and tell him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> If he is not that type of man.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> tell ur mother in law that she is safer at her own house.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> yes,but on the boobs/tits only OOOOOOOOOOk!!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> A girl who is kind and honest and wants to make me happy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> why do girls dress like tom-boys?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> nope..as long as your full time job isn't looking 4 1.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> 10 years ago, mine cost me $5,000.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> i don't think that u should kiss at all.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> tell this friend that he needs to get a backbone and ask her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> if you keep trying, she'll see you as a stalker and that's not where you wanna go with this.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> Don't linger, get in and get out.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> What if you two start working on it and she cheats on or leaves you for another man again.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> HoNeST MeN LoVe WoMeN: THoSe DeCieVe THeM AdOrE THeM
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> You did the right thing... don't worry bout it ... u'll find someone else!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> lol what the hell.. were you drunk on your wedding day??
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> I lost weight.. but I was in the bathroom at least 10 times a day...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> because he doesn' t want to spend the moneyon someone other than himself or he's not ready for marriage
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> If she still isnt doing it right...well, your call.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> they, actually were jealous of my mother and I.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> I actually went through this recently myself...wow!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> Please don't think all men are the same- we aren't.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> then u'll understnd the value of life.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> If your wife wants more sex have her call me.Ha!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> Yes mosdef you can get pg.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> Thats the kinda thing that guys do.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_25> Give him his freedom for Christmas!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> She'll probably be flattered that you only want her!
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_45> move on its over post a pic and maybe we can talk
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> try to forget about the mean girls or those that don't work out-thats part of the game.

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> well how old r u bc i might know some that does
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> This is your test question, and also this is my test reply ... ;-)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> He just wants you to be happy.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> he s in my class n a good friend of mine.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> then he lost his job right before we moved here!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> im only a freshman and im in love.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> and at the end of the school he gave me a hug!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> it doesn't matter if she loves him, or if her father wants them to get married.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Look directly into his eyes & ask him if he is faithful to u.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> Did he think about you when he cheated?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> depend if you have a hot body
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> or take her out to spend time with her at her favorite resturant.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> Im coming at you from the cheaters side.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> there..s no match.. r  u planning to hang out with the same girl..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> it is not as easy as it sounds i know that but it works.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> you will know when the time is right
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> i think it is okay but just dont over do it!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> if you don't then someone has issues that need to work on.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> It goes back to Do as I say, not as I do.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> I DON'T REALLY THINK ABOUT IT.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> what ever happened to spare the rod spoil the child and spankings in school?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Am I happy when I'm with him?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> talk in a cool enviornment, afterall he is your father.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> he said same thing like her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> no I never send Christmas cards out
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> You should be pleasing her and she pleasing you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> are you able to let some things go?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> gotta agree with applejooce, just tell him
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> eeek... marriage your thinking about this too much.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> anything that will make me laugh all night long...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> old when i had my first kiss first real boyfriend.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> Its the little things that guys do that clue us in to what you are thinking.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> Though, we always talk at night(coz im working abroad) and takes care of the kids.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> What is wrong is that YOU don't love your spouse the way you used to.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> I dont celebrate x mas myself...  3 months dude xmas is over... LOL
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> lick her body starting with her hair till her toes
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_60> Try burning a cd with his fav.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Will you ever get drunk with tthem again?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> I was just wondering, Am I in love?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> I like a lot of girls too, and I want to ask them out.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Lots of gurls are this way.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> Cant put my finger on it but going to see her really scares me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> can he look into your eyes?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> I was just wondering, Am I in love?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> I like a lot of girls too, and I want to ask them out.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> Lots of gurls are this way.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> Cant put my finger on it but going to see her really scares me.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> can he look into your eyes?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> People get married and think well if it doesn't work out we can always get divorced.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> thats sexual harrassment, document the situation, get some evidence, tell her no, then sue for your retirement.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> no, it just doesnt happen as often.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> saometimes the hardest part is totally letting go!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> you have to open for him the way to not be a shy
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> and both of them ok with it ?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> And besides, I just popped a mint.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Yes i did think it was pretty slu***y but I am still married and havent had any problems.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> I can go on and on with reasons!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> No this isn't a dumb question, actually it's a great question!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Like I said, though, it's a hard question to answer.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_45> Tell your wife before she does.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> tell her youll leave her alone if she wishs.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> i think that a guy should love his wife if his wife aggrees.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> On the flip side, why does a woman nag as to where the guy is going?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> that it may or may not help them.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> DON'T HESITATE JUST TELL ME I WON'T TELL ANYONE!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> A girl , i see , but i don't know , named moonlight !
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_45> email me back with more info.mandie_mo_of_co
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> There is nothing more attractive than a girl who's having fun!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> no sir not wrong at all.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Should I Wait or Should I Go (as Wham sez)?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Many women always say they want a real man?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> ask more girls til one calls you back ;)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> and should i get her a gift?????
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> Do yall not like him for right serious reasons?
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_30> people that fit have better sex.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> its happened to me like 3 times
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> I BELIVE THAT U CAN ONLY FALL IN LOVE ONCE.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_10> YOU STUCK THE KNIFE IN YOUR OWN BACK...OUCH
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> if you could advise if you work as well that may help get a clearer answer
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> NO, you're not weird, unless you think you are!!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> When you feell like it is time... What I mean is that your hart will let you know.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_40> Do you know the way out
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> tell him until he decides he wants a conversational relationship with you no s*x, usually works
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> Now men think their women are lazy if the woman just wants to be a mom.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Do the one thing that many never do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> I'm wondering how old you are.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> If u don't love this person leave, but marrying someone else isn't wise either.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> WWII Singer from the Jersey Isle in Britian...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> dont jump to the assumption that u will definitely get hurt.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_50> how would he feel if you were friends with ur ex.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> Because a lot of men are looking for trophy wives.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> Online relationship shud b there for online purposes!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> if you sucess then congratulate you!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> sex is very important for men also money
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> look for guys that are serious about thier studies.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_10> BOTH SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE FRIENDS.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> as i am not married i dont know.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> don't answer just smirk and continue.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> And if it is--still no excuse to cheat on your wife.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> sit down and think of it and speak up.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_10> WELL,FIRST OF ALL DUDE, CONGRATS!..I FEEL LIKE TELLING YOU TO KEEP THEM ALL.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> is it wrong for a woman to date her ex-husbands brother.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_5> NO STINGS muah have fun and JUST DO IT
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> how about a man that will take care of themselves!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> ill tell you what worked for me.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> The kids get hurt the worst.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> (Frankly, I don't like roses all that much!)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> nothing, you broke up with him in the first place didn't you?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> If you want to...  without question - yes!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> like i said dont do it just cuz people u care about want you to.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> first off, you should get to know her, become her friend first.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> Magic 8 Ball says:  Ask again later
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> if you find your love winds down for even one of you it probly just infatution.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> for the upper answer... a player @ 42 years?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> why do women feel as though men want to controll them back at you
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> She still wants a relationship with the guy, that's pretty obvious.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> If u dont ask she loose her for ever so dont waste time my friend.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> you should ask youself some questions before beginning a life with someone.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> cause your partner trust you that you are not deceiving him
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> If I don't marry her she'll leave me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> for some reason guy round here feel cause they like you, that u should automatically like them back.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> some just like it that way!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> gift cards are the best way to go with anyone these days.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Who's to say, just go with whats comfortable for you
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> a good woman woudnt do that.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> If I ask him out then i'll pay.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> ALL YOUR ACTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES no matter when or how long it has been...
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_20> meams ur pretty dam good-lookin', if ya have 3 g/f's!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> How do you love him if you barely ever talk?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Hi Sweety, Well not all women do but I guess most do.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Is it really worth it to cheat on your wife.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Think about this your are saving the best for last!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> have fun, and do not be afraid to discuss and ene try new things.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> likes guy stuff (sports, etc...) and can hang with the guys and make them laugh.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> I did once just for fun.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> just b/c you asked doesnt mean you do or dont.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> if u love him, can talk to him about ANYTHING.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Oh yeah, and if you're a girl...it hurts like hell the first time.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> if i guy can't accept that, then he is not worth your time.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> doesn't the other grrr deserve a chance?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> yeah because parents like 2 screw ppl up
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> And if he says no, then that's just that.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> but too difficult to wait till marriage!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Not to be rude or piss you off or anything, but it sounds like she still loves her husband.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_20> H E L L O :)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> That's quite impressive - 90 a day and that's just ONE service!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> But I assure you......never stop looking.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> something u can have with me that is if u are over the age of 18
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> my condolences go out to you !
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> When you move, keep your phone number unlisted and get a p.o.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> how do you ask a boy out?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> if they belong to you, they will come back.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> Because if a girl chases a guy, he feels cornered.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> well it depends on the guy how old is he how old you are.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> Words don't mean much...actions speak louder.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> YOU DON'T TRUST HIM AGAIN CHEATING IS DISGUSTING.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> But, i asked, and she explained.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_25> who knows maybe u two might go all the way!!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> give her all she wants and more......
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_10> SORRY TO PLACE YOU IN SUCH AN UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION.... SHALL WE CARRY ON NOW??
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> yes it's bad...you should be desiring each other all the time.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> you won't know until you try
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> Flowers or choclates and you can always get her some earrings man
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> Wow... thanks for the kind compliments you fine bunch of wonderful ladies!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> If your a 30 yr old dude LEAVE THE KIDS ALONE!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Sounds like something my friend is going through right now,, he needs help but you can't do it alone!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> flirting can lead to a lot of things just dont let it do that...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> maybe she got bored with ya...expected some things outta ya, and you didnt deliver..wake up, that happens
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> If so then you are in love.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> actually the average size is 5, so it really depends on the genes.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> you have nothing else to loose.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> i know a girl like that ,   and i try to stay away from her
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> But still shouldnt be that big of a deal if you know how u feel about that other person.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> mtv also has an influence on girls too but hey thats their problem
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Then he will ask you y u r doing like this.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> Some things are just not meant to be.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> how can i get over this person easier, and is there anybody out there that needs a new friend?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Look up their phone number in the phone book?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> whether that is worth trying, or even possible, is up to you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_90> u will never know if he likes u unless u ask.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Dude... it as easy as reading your letter...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> because it would be wrong to ask him to break up with a girl that he just got with.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> give a smile, or do something which makes her laugh at u.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i'm sure another girl would appreciate u better!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Because he wants to hammer you grrr, don't do this, don't you remember what jon said in the 80s.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Something clicked like magic, and it was like I was in heaven!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> it isn't that hard to find a great chick thats nice to you, is it?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> Marriage is not about what you get man, it's about what you give.

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> think of your kids first..they dont need abuse in their home.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> So men learn that I can do what I want and lie and she will still get over it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> It's like slamming your finger in a window over, and over, it feels good when you stop!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> Acutally I like Cats answer, it's prrrrrrrfect:)

<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> how could u forget look on the license
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_15> Get her to eventually ask him back to her place or something similar.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> get her close to orgasm and when she tell you to stop, stop and get away.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> Hope you can understandme... Everything is up to you, just think a little about it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> See if he finally gets the message.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> ALL THE STATES HAVE GOODLOOKING GIRLS AND WOMEN EVEN THOUGH ALOT OF PEOPLE ARE TO DUMB TO SEE THAT!!!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> Get her to eventually ask him back to her place or something similar.

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> defenely if he is nice...it is not the looks but what is inside that counds.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Now things are really messed up.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> And add a good Pick Up Artist online resource.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> how much dating did you do ?
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_25> And let's talk some more o.k.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> That even goes for a 18-year old dating an 17-year old.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> its a bummer, but they can get away with it most of the time.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> cant really snap out of it until they do something really stupid and out of hand.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> And if it doesn't work, it just makes it that much easier to get over her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Isn't that wrong of her, or what?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Your in High School you should be dating a lot of people not just her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> make sure u really want it.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> Sit back and peep her out.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> because they can be....now go out and fin a girl that doesnt poop on you
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> just get it over with.and try to be sincere.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> not really its usually the other person has something you don't have
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> having sex with other people not in the relationship and the partner not caring and/or doing the same thing.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> because there is no such thing
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> someone who cheated is probably deceptive... they will lie and say they don't know why, when, really, they do
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Please give me some tips so i can have a orgasim when ever I want!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> or put an azo pill in her soda to make her pee orange.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> welcome to the 21st century, dave!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> And the second and third from what I recall.....
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> If he thinks that 100 is not too many, then hey, you’re like a virgin.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> do you love him for who he is?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> goto switchboard.com and put in the there address
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> Worth looking for if hard to find.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Are you dating younger men just to play around and they get too serious?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> But it's not that big a deal, when you think about it.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> no more than 12  no less than 5
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> goto switchboard.com and put in the there address
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> Worth looking for if hard to find.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> If you can get over that then your str8.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> LEt me know if it works.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> u tell him,  so you are really serious,huh?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> just because you want to get back together with him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> YOU COULD JUST E-MAIL ME THE MONEY GIRL!I COULD GIVE YOU MY E-MAIL ADRESS DO YOU WONT IT?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> If you can get over that then your str8.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_20> LEt me know if it works.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_10> u tell him,  so you are really serious,huh?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_10> just because you want to get back together with him.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> YOU COULD JUST E-MAIL ME THE MONEY GIRL!I COULD GIVE YOU MY E-MAIL ADRESS DO YOU WONT IT?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> !If you don't like it, then move on to the next category...duh!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> I am afraid that she may get angry ........ or she might not like me ........
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Don't pull away too quickly, and if he pulls you back in....you know he likes you!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> depending upon.. who is and how the date went..
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> I noticed that i get attitude towards guys who for some reason unknown to me wanna holla.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> But that first time in love stuff just happens when you first fall in love.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> i think cards that would say, one free back scratch or one free massage or one free kiss.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> Yes, I think its really bad !!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> they're everywhere, you just have to identify which is which.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> Well if your family is anything like mine.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> what can I do for her?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> go with the flow cause maybe he is just scared to be in love.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> I guess u just have to date until u find the right one.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Don't mess up a good friendship.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> ummmm.... i don't think its romantic i thinks its gross, but also farts are funny.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> what if he/she didnt like you because you had, short hair...etc etc...you see?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> this will be an investment for u for future
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> YALL JUST THINK ABOOUT THE UPS AND DOWNS WITH IT.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> Showing your love is all the little things that you do for someone you love.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> what if he/she didnt like you because you had, short hair...etc etc...you see?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> this will be an investment for u for future
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> love = koigokoro  you  = temae  so it means that u love someone in chinese language
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_10> YALL JUST THINK ABOOUT THE UPS AND DOWNS WITH IT.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> Showing your love is all the little things that you do for someone you love.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> HE IS CONTROLING WANTS TO MAKE YOU THINK YOU OWE HIM
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_10> LIVE*LAUGH*LOVE ITS AS SIMPLE AS THAT
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> its not the best situation to be in
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> if you like the person why not?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Ask yourself, is she worth waiting for, are YOU willing to wait?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Start checking out other guys, let him know how it feels.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> FIRST OF ALL YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD AN AFFAIR , BUT THE DAMAGE IS ALREADY DONE.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> Nope not at all unless it was only sex and even then make sure you protect yourself.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> Because people get married with divorce in the back of their minds already.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> First of all, don't let him know you are thinking about leaving.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> He buys me whatever i want, but he doesn't want me to do anything for him.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> if have not already found out, make sure shes single.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> but women see it different than us men.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> just go up to him and asked him out.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> Britney Spears Ass or Carmen Electra's mouth!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> If I'd had the choice I would say YES, without thinking twice...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> now if she is just being polite and not interested in you.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> I do know one guy who met his wife that way!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> I've cheated, and been cheated on.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Just look at it like this... men expel and women retain!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> some other guy to come get her at YOUR house wouldent you get a little jelous
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> u kno they could be sex addicts.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> im impressed by a man who doesn't try to impress me.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> So she has to turn a lot more guys down before she finds one that she likes.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Frankly, its not that big a deal.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> If hate is amiss, it's like a funny smell in an elevator.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> i said how many do you drink.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> for me it is a felling u can never put in words
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> you will definitely know if it happens... its too intense not to notice.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> If he looks at other girls when you are not around then, O.K.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> (unless u don't mind other guys banging your girl)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> it depends on if he really really likes u or not
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> either u have a good figure or u r extremely beautiful.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> I like a cool chick with a hot ass.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> 3- You find a good girl and you don't want her to marry some one else.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> I THINK YOU ARE MORE LONELY THAN IN LOVE.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_10> WHAT IF HE GAVE YOU SOMETHING.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> i'll take the brunette please    thanks
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> Go to USA if you like an american girlfriend...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> if you have to ask, then i would say no.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> cus they are bored and don't have anything better to do...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> If you're thinking of asking someone, but not sure, just DO IT!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> and if he stalks, call the police.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> u just have to marry him to know HOW husband he will be.family life changes everyone.merry x-mas
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> Many, Many girls (and Guys) prefer a uncut guy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> but you must enter his full name.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> WHY DO YOU WANT TO SEE HER TOES??
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> i think you should be bold anough and ask him
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> i have never heard this before.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_20> And legally you can't do anything about that.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_15> I LOVE HIM BUT I NEED TO MOVE ON, HE IS MARRIED,PLEASE HELP ME, I AM SO DEPRESSED.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> cuz everybody got a freak side to them.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> no cry-baby whining stuck-up prissy high-maintenance jealous back stabbing hoochie like most women are.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> the limits are but u cannot hold it till death i think :P
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> quit nagging him and get him a beer.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> She needs some attention from you sweetie!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> Best of luck finding the right answer !!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> anyway if u really want help on this mail me to acriyaz@gmail.com ................. bye - ac riyaz
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> because they are insecure dweebs and can't handle a real woman.

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> jest look to her eye :)

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> its in the people search section.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> to an extent... yes it does.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> she refused you once... meaning you two werent really together?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> and is she as a freind more important to you or this guy you like?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> I tell u this from experience!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> if u trust him, have met his family and i just pray.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> She expects from a boy to do things,,about which she is thinking,,,got it???
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> when u missed him/her when she /he is gone
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> 2nd, he might actually respect you, like most guys dont, and doesnt wanna ruin a good thing.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> nice guys sometimes are too attainable.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> cheat while she is buzy cheating u
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> he's looking to cheat on you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> I don't think it is wrong.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> I didn't realize how sick I am.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> Show her you are a nice caring guy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Like french kissing and makeing out.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> small claims court...if you got proof that they have it?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> The answer is: No, there is not a chance with him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> yea..besides a tree some men would probably like some polo boots for the winter..really depends on the age?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> and have kept a freindship since her divorce.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Did you try to turn around?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> To ask out a girl you like, don't sweat it or practice it over & over in the mirror.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> Usually women like this will give it up to the man who doesn't buy into their BS.......
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_15> LET YOUR FRIEND DO AS THEY PLEASE.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> plus it always kinda hurts when a break up doesnt affect the other party.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> yes...and if you ask real nice...he may give you someTHING extra!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> i haven't heard anything about them.why don't you ask them?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> what if she is really mean/crazy?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> arcade, go cart riding, bowling, play pool
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Perhaps she is thinking the same thing... how can I tell if he still loves me?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> any where i perfer some where nice
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> i say no because if he done that to you once it will probably happen again.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Because you'll always come back to him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> or you could just talk to him!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> and if she likes you to she will understand.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> it might be that your wife only had cybersex but that is still sex.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> I need one for a guy that I like alot.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> the whole saying about...guys mature a few yrs.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> So flirt one of 'em and you will be in love.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> a gravitation force which pulls u
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> girls never go for sensitive guys.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I would take her with me, then go hang at the mall, but I like Richs answer best
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> If u still have problems file an complaint and reverse it to them!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> I certainly wouldn't do that to just anyone.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> Why do so many people have sex with other people that they have no intention of ever marrying?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> My husband got me a leather jacket for our 5th Christmas!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> If u still have problems file an complaint and reverse it to them!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> I certainly wouldn't do that to just anyone.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> Why do so many people have sex with other people that they have no intention of ever marrying?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> My husband got me a leather jacket for our 5th Christmas!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> have an affair with married man.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> WHY YOU ARE LOOKING FOR free DO U HAVE SOME MONEY PROBLEM?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> and finally ask him why, what does she mean to him?...will it happen again?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> no,she might dump you because shell think you want to have it with her and her mom.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> or if you meet her at home she will need to look for a vase to put it in.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> i jst wont waste my time.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> WHY YOU ARE LOOKING FOR free DO U HAVE SOME MONEY PROBLEM?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> and finally ask him why, what does she mean to him?...will it happen again?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> no,she might dump you because shell think you want to have it with her and her mom.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_15> or if you meet her at home she will need to look for a vase to put it in.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> i jst wont waste my time.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> You could just hang back and see how she handles it...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> He is most definitely a LOWLIFE who SUCKS!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> does the cock size really matter?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Actually I know more women than men that way.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Most of the guys that like big girls a really skinny.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> This is tough because of what you said...you're still in love with him (how long were you guys dating?).
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> ignore the ones who said alcahol.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> well u never know ur luck so there might be a big persentage or a little one good luck!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> THEY ONLY WHANT ONE THING(-----)NOT THE RESPONSIBILITY OF A FAMILY.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> and don't listen to those other bogus answers about maybe he wants to wait for marriage... thats not true.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> IF YOU KNOW HE FREQUENTS A CERTAIN CLUB OR RESTURANT, JUST STAY AWAY.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> easy rule of thumb:  you sleep with guys and if you enjoy yourself you're  gay.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> I like answering these kind of questions!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> Or do u love what he was and what he could be, if he wants?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> Just as some women do, and some don't.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> not downing anybody, just trying to constructivly think here.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> In a woman: long hair, nice legs & butt, small breasts.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> But like I said the best advice is TIME.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> He will not care about it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> you have my confidence good luck bro.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_15> My question how do I go about this?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> I am a girl and I am not.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> guys are guys and the jump from one topic to the next.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> you have my confidence good luck bro.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> And kinda watch over the whole situation...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> My question how do I go about this?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_70> I am a girl and I am not.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> guys are guys and the jump from one topic to the next.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> I just had sexual relations over the internet with some other random guy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> And flowers...there must ALWAYS be flowers:)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> One guy was really creepy and scared me.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> or use yahoo personals  i am looking for a part time lover too.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> But that they do not want to have children with you or marry you.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> Plus its just having fun with one another and pleasuring one another.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Well, first off ask him if he is.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> you just know if you like someone.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> redheads with a fine sexy body.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> If she doesnt set this guy straight then maybe you should say something to her...
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> I really like this girl but im too shy to tell her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> most girls do that maybe because they have a crush on them and you want to impress him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Just remember a life long commiment is just that, life long.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> I really like this girl but im too shy to tell her.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> most girls do that maybe because they have a crush on them and you want to impress him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> Just remember a life long commiment is just that, life long.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_20> Head it off at the pass?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> Go go a blog sites..like yahoo 360 or msn myspaces thing...give her a link...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> I agree with catnip... my mother never care any of my BF's business.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> the smaller it is, the lower your self confidence, the worse your performance.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> Hey dude... wake up and smell the coffee.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> go out with friends not necessarily males but females
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> keep ur personality high and don't do it .... your r too high-class than ask such thing
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> maybe point out to him if you see someone kissing.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Family In General Division - Ew no!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> just go whatever the best that you've had think!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> And He didn't try to have sex!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> we met 26 days ago, and im willing to have some more days together with him.....
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> i would say good just keep looking
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> How can I get her to love me?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Just don't go overboard with it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> the fact that you even put yourself in the position to watch her makes yourself a cheater!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> If he likes women older than him, he probably likes a mature woman.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> don't forget to use your ears.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> No matter how cool and charming they are.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> it seams like he dosen't trust you if he is jealous, i wouldn't
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> i first started dating at 14!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> In fact my girlfriend does it sometimes!!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> I've actually never used them, but my realionship couldn't be better!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> friends friemds or she may be someone u allready know
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> When did i stop doing that?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> men are hunters, women are nesters.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> You know i get the same crap from my friends and family.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> when you find out, you let me know
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> tell them that you like them.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Remember any guy can sweep any girl off her feet- he just needs the right broom.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> That do u gurls look for in a guys personality attributes?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> it wont work out...if he cheated on ya once, he will again
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> its because she doesnt think anybody would like her in the flesh.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> deadma lang pag sumunod p din deadma k uli & tell her the worst of u
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> Spending time with friends or keeping oneself busy (NOT by cheating though...).
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> sorry but your are still a child!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> GOING OUT DO YOU STILL USE THAT EXPRESSION THESE DAYS.PLEASE DO ME A FAVOUR AND DONT ACT SO DESPERATE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> did he spend time with u at least on that day?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> Hey baby... Do you have a little (insert ethnic group of speaker here) in you?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> For the same reason men do!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> ya its a good idea, just nothing too expensive, under 20 bucks should be ok.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> think about the world of problems that alone opens up.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> Hey, I have a crush on you.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_25> Good Luck... Hope he kicks your face loose!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Oh, men are just strange.......So simple....Yet so complex..I think every man does it at least once.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> My big brown eyes and my boobs... yes they're real!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Finally...remember the way you get a gal IS the way you lose them.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> I want her back.... and that feeling is not going away.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> if he invites you to do something with him and/or his friends.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Is she in love with you soldier boy?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> I saw it with my own eyes.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> most people these days look at physical stuff.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> WOMEN CAN BE EQUALLY AS GUILTY AS MEN.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> That way she can get what ever she wants.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> He said that if I died, he'd kill himself, so I humored him and said, Ok.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> LOOK FOR SIGNS THAT SHE LIKES YOU.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Other people are drawn to that and you'll have more friends than you ever dreamed.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Once they are mature enough though..
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Then smile, peck him and give him a big hug!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> And then,  get a big piece of paper and write I LOVE YOU!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Most Girls only look for the wallet and they are idiots for doing so.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> thats the only solution until you're ready 2 move on
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> I wouldn't go back out with him for one thing.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> maybe you guys could have a really strong relationship.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> Don't mess with the other girl's boyfriend.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> [whew got tired writing that last sentence.]
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> you can have one with out the other.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> This is your best friend, your lover and the one person you dream about going old with.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> She is 18 and she's a big girly girl.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> From parenting Q&A:  Q: Is it OK to talk about sex with my 12 year-old?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> For the past two weeks me and my bf wasnt clicking like we use to.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> if you've been dating a short time, she probably isn't interested in you anymore.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> once; if they are the one, you'll know it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> ITS NOT THE END OF THE WORLD if it goes wrong.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Brake it to her gently that you just don't want her to be in your wedding.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Ok then do you have a job?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> knowing you can spend the rest of your life devoted to that one person.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> I heard Raz B told that to sister to sister magazine.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> oh god i m so confused please solve my questions.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> Don't be afraid, you might get invited and have a blast.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> well several diff reason are you like every guy and do nothing but eat sleep shit and watch tv?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I heard Raz B told that to sister to sister magazine.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> oh god i m so confused please solve my questions.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Don't be afraid, you might get invited and have a blast.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> well several diff reason are you like every guy and do nothing but eat sleep shit and watch tv?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> And btw...I'm speaking from personal experience - it does work - so good luck!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> Ok maybe that's just me again since I like art.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> DUREX, unless you want a sensation of a broken condom :)
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_45> always jewlery or chance by channel.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> and then of course there is always the naughty christmas gift.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> but then kiss him and such.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> This is the way families are established... Go ahead and be happy, you two!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> u gotta get ova that shit.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> Men who are best friends are friends because they trust eachother!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> take a cruise you can find cheap if you book late
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Really give it to the Salvation Army
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> If he doesn't like it-just ask him to cut it
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> because, they need to decide who has a bigger rack and whos @$$ is nicer, lol.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_30> no i heard that was a rumor.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> at the moment i feel like fall in love at the first site.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> #1 rule never go back always go forward.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> do you get that a lot, or am i crazy?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> What do u gurls look for in guys physical appearance?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> That statment....well i am still waiting.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_30> but if not wit untill you are really ready.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> Use manners, so many people forget that lately!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> dude as long as ur not loud and they're asllep just do it!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Ever had the girl you don't like and have made fun of and teased suddenly be crazy about you?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> TRUE LOVE IS WORTH WAITING FOR,HE SAYS THAT HES WORKING ON IT, GIVE HIM A CHANCE.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> but with love with eyes closed.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> And before you ever get married always get tested together.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> Look, you can't keep a woman that don't want to be kept.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_25> coz guys dont think twice b4 going for it ..
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> If the love you have found hurts then, baby it's not love!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> And the cultural and religious differences; we won't even go there!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> why god set my mind when i cant get him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> well it depends, especially for me.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> I say this because once you cheat once you can not stop.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> the more she treats me like shit the better
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Men see that as criticism........even though you so don't mean for it to be!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> yeah....i like this one girl and i only have 2 classes with her
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> Said he tried to kill her with IT.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> who cares if you kissed another girl?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> when we were kids we plkayed that game.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> your gut feeling is usually always right.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> yeah....i like this one girl and i only have 2 classes with her
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> Said he tried to kill her with IT.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> who cares if you kissed another girl?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> when we were kids we plkayed that game.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> your gut feeling is usually always right.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> and i now that doesnt apply to all guys, but most of them!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Please specifify if it's a gf, wife, stranger, friend, etc.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> i thnk u must give more time for ur relationship.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> I went crazy and bought my boyfriend all sorts of stuff the first Christmas.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> hey i think either is just fine with me but i prefer bad guys.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> ); to me you're taking a chance both ways.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> If he is so far gone to say yes, then you know it is over anyway.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> and when is sex too long (after 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, etc.)
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> Is Gay what your intersted in?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> Try this, but whatever you do, be very genuine don't be fake.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> or if it doesn't brake up with him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> usually during the first date the guy tries to impress you and something goes terribly wrong.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> You just don't know about it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Could be that she is shy.Why don't you give it another chance and talk to her again?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Some men are sexier without hair.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> when he feels comfortable with his gf.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> ask a friend to do it for you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> I could go on and on about this, but to sum it up the answer is HELL NO!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> No, men just think that women answer questions like that.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> i had a great friendship with a 37 at the age of 18.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Try to have any details about her!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> if its respectable and mutual, its a beautiful thing.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> YOU'RE 15 THATS A LITTLE TOO OLD FOR SPANKING IN MY BOOK.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_10> because they want to impress them
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> Dont give her too much space, because if you do, thats mostily going to end up bad!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Try to have any details about her!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> if its respectable and mutual, its a beautiful thing.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_20> YOU'RE 15 THATS A LITTLE TOO OLD FOR SPANKING IN MY BOOK.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> because they want to impress them
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> he said no that means there is no womenly instinct matters.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> The first love it the hardest to forget!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> it didn't work out for us.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> So I told him that we should be friends.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> tell him though you are not a stalker you just felt like saying hi
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> or did she give you something.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> So tell my why do guy do that?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> I guess men just get caught more.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> But hey.. it's a unique thought!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> (Just have to say though, that calla lillies are awesome and you can get them in LOADS of colors)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> or did she give you something.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> So tell my why do guy do that?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> I guess men just get caught more.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_10> But hey.. it's a unique thought!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_10> (Just have to say though, that calla lillies are awesome and you can get them in LOADS of colors)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Porn n : creative activity (writing or pictures or films etc.)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> we're just waiting for the catch!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> Man I have the same problem!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> that he's a disrespectful bastard that likes to get smacked in the face.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> So i feel u need to move on and still rember your kid.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> If you are religious and don't believe in premarital sex, then don't do it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> Yes, but make it a coupon for a blo-job or something like that
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> Hey, sometimes you find love where you weren't really looking for it.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> If not, there's plenty other fish in the sea baby!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> Someone whose not scared to cry.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> The bad boy image sometimes girls like, but I doubt those relationships last too long.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> I'm not that kind of guy and I think that guys that are, are cowards.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> To young to date or be in love!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> they might be feeling the same way and want more too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Hope you find the right one.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> before he goes out dress really sexy so that he can't go out with the boys!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> how does this make you feel.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> It has been 37years now and well...what ever?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> if she fell in love, well, it seems hard.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> You're not engaged (yet)...so there's really no reason to worry (as of yet).
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> I think it is wrong to cheat.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> there are two ways of cheating at a modern day.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> try getting a girl then taking her picture.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> But if you want sex with him, too.. then talk to him all you want.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> If you want extravagant, then $20,000.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_10> SO GO & KISSSSS YOUR LOVED ONES & ASK WHETHER THEY FELT CHEATED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_15> RELAX AND IF IT IS MEANT SHE WILL COME TO YOU.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_20> (FYI: not putting civilian guys down) Good luck hun!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> I guess ALL men need is lovin and nuttin else!
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> no REAL man waits until marriage!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> Do I REALLY want to get married somewhere else?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> If u don't cheat her, she will also never tend to cheat u.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> somebody said to just do it within 3 seconds.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> (If she doesn't pull  away then she WANTS the kiss).
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_10> WELL THEY WILL PROBLE HAVE A CELEPHONE IF THEY HAVE A PHONE THEY A PROBLE BE CHEATEN ON YA.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> it's how tight the you know what is.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> how much you should spend depends on a few things.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> So now everybodys happy but him!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> My answer: (pssst...is it in yet??)
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> Do you not have grounds for divorce???
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Or is it that you want to be the female version of 'The One'??
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> or wait until u get to know him better to tell  him about the kids.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Just don't get 'em mad by getting them drunk!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> IS THERE A HEART TO LISTEN TO OR JUST A TEENAGE PUPPY LOVE?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> if someone did it to you and you didnt like it, then why ruin someones marriage?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Both the girl I dated and her sister are very beautiful.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> get a bass boat instaed, you'll have it next summer.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_40> Use it and get him to loose the hag.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> if it doesnt stop report him to the authorities!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> in  relationships i find making out wonderful, then the last base!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> love is something that two people share.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> Not weird, just don't let security catch you!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> ask him to pick u or her.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> he supposely likes and we hold hands and he flirts.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> try courting..but dont be too fast,take it slow and be a gentleman ofcourse.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> then you'll be happy and he'll be all yea!!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> Well that all depends on if you want your family and friends there.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> and so wht if u get the girl, he's just haten
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> Us guys are so afraid of making the first move...so go on knock his socks off!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> now he is broke and pissed off all the time.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> beside you marry him and your the one who really proposed.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Baby or Hunni...she calls me Pooh Bear, Boo Boo, Her slave...etc.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_25> yes go for it you love her
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> so take a step if she doesnt say not yet you have a go ahead.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> think long and hard, do you love him.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> IF THATS NOT AN OPTION THERE ARE OTHER SOURCES
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> it depends what hes lieing about
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> That would depend..are we talking years or days?..do you love her?..if so ..yeah why not?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Let her know you think about  her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> I found a girl that I love.. and I love her for who she is.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> it seems small but it means so much!
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> What can I do to get her back?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> love is a thing which everone do's.we get stuck in love
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> i fell good when i am with him but soon after i feel bored....
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> Don't pull away too fast, and if he pulls you back in...well you know you got one!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> 1st of all- don't marry him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> She said hes just a friend, even refers to him as her homeboy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> THEY NEED NO EXTRA REASON TO KISS LOL HAPPY HOLIDAYS !
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Ask yourself this question...Would YOU want some other guy to try to take YOUR girlfriend away from YOU?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> she didn't cherish your love like you cherish hers.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> is it to make love wit somebody?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I'm pretty sure they wouldn't do that for you due to all the pain you'd be in!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> they prefer them with back hair instead
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> if you're OK w/ Women's Lib, & Girl power, & that stuff, yes.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> ur girl friend had not accepted no.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> My boyfriend wanted to have a baby and get married, but changed his mind... too late.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> Maybe he thinks ya'll can get back together.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> it probably won't for you if religion is a major factor in one of your lifes.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> I guess you mean relationship with gals like sex or love, from their bf or husband.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> ur girl friend had not accepted no.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> My boyfriend wanted to have a baby and get married, but changed his mind... too late.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Maybe he thinks ya'll can get back together.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> it probably won't for you if religion is a major factor in one of your lifes.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> I guess you mean relationship with gals like sex or love, from their bf or husband.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> other bitches call my house 24/7 and i have to tell them off.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> you can do it but thats nasty and your kids would come out all wrong
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_25> The list is too long to name
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> but sometimes its not so n iam sure one can judge the best him/herself
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> Hi Kat, you have to be safe with this one.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> I THINK NOW MEN AND WOMEN CHEAT FOR VARIOUS REASONS.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Why not say it if you are not married if you really mean it?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> your questions dont make no sense!!!!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> yes, go to the courthouse and ask for the paperwork..usually its only about 200 bucks.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> Do exactly what your heart is telling you then.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> If you didn't have sex with him.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> grow some nuts and talk to her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Guys don't really care too much about birthdays like women do.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> If he already in love in other don't distrube him and search for other guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> a woman will stay with a man no matter what anyone says if she loves him
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I want a baby badly too, but why make myself miserable and poor by having it now?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Although guys rarely take girls back but girls seem to take guys back.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> make me feel happy and free
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I don't think you ever stop loving your ex.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> LOL  Kinda like a caveman gene.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> as far as the two of you are willing to work at keeping it that way.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> i think it is a turn off only because i dont like the way it feels on my face.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> Funny cuz I have that problem but I try.It helps some though.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> but if your wondering why lesbians hate you, youve already answered your own question.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> All its doing is asking for is trouble.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> I call her my meali'i and I am her po'okela.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Hey...you wanna go back to my place, order a pizza, and hump?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> ask urself these questions...did he have the money?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> And if it doesn't, just be happy being happy
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> If you like more things about then go for it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> *> BUT THATS COLD NOT GIVING YOU SOMETHING FOR YOUR BIRTH DAY.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> i'll create one and give it up...wait
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> and presto u'll have ur love back.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> If it works out, great...if not, no loss.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> because they are friends and family ?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> NOW THAT ALL DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> most people at my school know im gay anyway.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> Did it work, (even if it was for a laugh) and why?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> i think he just left elementary school, w/ F's in every class!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> i feel liek i should do something.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Lots of things to think about if you're looking for life!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> Im 17 and shes been with me since i was 8 i think.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> its illegal and the 20 year old should be put away
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> Oh try it with the lights on!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> When men talk to men they rarely lie...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Because most guys are wussies around women.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> One I just never hit it off with.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> I hope u liked it and use it i really think it sweet.............
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> If she can't see what a wonderful person you are, then she is not the one for you...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> show (dont tell) her that you can fullfil all her need and want!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> i really couldn't tell u what it was but all i  know is that its fun...and feels good!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> without grabbing her arm or stepping to her to be rejected.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> if your mother thanks its ok tell someone else.teacher,nurse at school.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> BUY HER WHAT YOU WANT HER TO HAVE AFTER ALL ITS THE THOUGHT THAT COUNTS
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> she will if ur nice to her and do things for her and dont be an idiot to her
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> whiles standing infront/on the phone with her, of course...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> nothing it just makes the illegal, legal
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> but carry on, love and be loved!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> My sis and bro keep bugging me and I keep asking them to stop bugging me.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> y do they always forget important dates unlike us women
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> if i see a cute woman, how do i ask her out?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> I got divorced and went broke... she didn't care...
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> I have no real advice, because I can't do it myself.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> he sounds like he likes playing mind games to get girls crazy about him.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> they say it is a mans ego but a woman she is a hoe.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> don't no girl want to weak a$$ man so u can't be a punk about it.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> blah and then call only once a week?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> maybe going to the beach , somthing interesting and creative.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_20> Once again trust me it work
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> but unless you fed up dont break up ask him why he dont give you gifts.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> You need to go somewhere you can talk and just hang out and have fun.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> Don't deal anyone throwin' curve balls at you!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> Unless u can't afford it then don't bother... lol.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> though he was honest, it still sucks.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Just be careful, a lot of guys are users.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> I don't know, your the one in love, right?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> SEE I BROKE UP WITH THIS GIRL AND THEN IT BROKE MY HEART
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> well kill them with kindness has always had a funny sound to it.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> BUT IF ALL YOU GET IS PROMISES AFTER PROMISES, WATCH OUT!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> its a friend but you can have sex and its ok = )
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> try to listen before speaking you might miss out on somthing inportent
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> and if you love the girl the age doesnt matter is all about feelings...

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> to give ugly people their first kiss

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> YES... Hope it worked for you, I've discovered that they suck anyway.

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> he prob wants to take it slow or become friends with benifits?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> b/c in the end you will all get burned if you dont.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> You just have to wait on her, she's out there.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Ain't that a great news !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> It's like asking why don't women find bald men attractive.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> lol you put the peepee in the vagina and hump hump hump

<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Well it wouldnt be as special if you didnt write it yourself now would it
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Dont worry you will still find someone who really is in love with you, just keep looking.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> thy looking at it that way
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_20> So even though it's not easy move on.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> it means he is still heterosexual and still alive
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> get her something she can use with her husband.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_15> oh my god, do you even have to ask that?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_10> i think most people likes  to have a christmass gift
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> So even though it's not easy move on.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> it means he is still heterosexual and still alive
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> get her something she can use with her husband.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> oh my god, do you even have to ask that?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> i think most people likes  to have a christmass gift
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> You don't want someone that reminds you of your dad, that would be kind of creepy.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> well i believe in love at first sight but some are just a mere infatuation as we call it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> not if thats what you enjoy and you like the moment... and regret doesnt come.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> just forget it and save yourself the embarrassment.. trust me.

<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> The heck with that guy he is a two time loser.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> figure out what it is you like about both of them - and decide who makes you happiest.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> If you do it online your just getting a little help.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> (then eyelashes; bf has really long eyelashes and IT'S DEAD SEXY.)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> JUST TRY TO STAY OUT OF EACHOTHERS WAY.

<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> who knows, you might be a spoiled brat who needs a good whippin'.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Its depends if they are not phycho's or stalkers.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> women are individuals...just tell her that you're simple minded and have her tell you outright what is wrong.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> Tessa, you took the thought right out of my head!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> what do they say size does matter?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I only say I love you when i mean it.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> ( watch the movie walk in the cloud)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Now, did I try to fight it?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> And instand of u being the one looking for the girl,your the one gettin look for.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Depends..are you materialistic and shallow?...if so then YES.. if not ..NO...life is too short for trivial things.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> some people spend the rest of their lifes together without ever saying i love u
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> Don't tell her - SHOW her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Some guy walking down the street saw it and said You are a gentleman.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> nooo star wars is over rated and thats crap!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> LOVE HURTS BECAUSE IT IS REAL.....

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> with words comming from your mouth!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> I don't know what I am going to do either.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> some will tell you to forget about him, but i no thats hard.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> Actually, even thinking about someone without your partner knowing is cheating.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> Hi, my name is <insert name here>, what's yours?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> Your avatar is bald, so I'm assuming you are, too, and I wanted your bonus points!!)
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> make him feel like he is the man!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Use people-talk openers like 'Do you know Steve?'
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> And you said I was a loser.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Talking about cars, cell phones, & buddies, negative!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> shown how important he thinks it all is.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Tell him something like, We shouldn't be doing this.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I threatened to put more garlic in his food if he didn't back off!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> I wouldnt go down on a girl thats stank.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> Find a distraction - school, work, X-mas shopping (just no subsance abuse, OK?).
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Most women I meet are married, have b/f, or have 5 kids and can't date.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> yeah unless your related to them or they already have a girl friend
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> don't even try, he will see throught it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> In other words, its not like you just went out & turned up pregnant.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> give it up, girl you deserve better!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> under 25-30 bucks but is my favorite gift yet....
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> hey babe ping me on coolnishith2000@yahoo.com.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> I'll pray for you.. God bless.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> AND IF YOU ARE, DO HIM A FAVORE, DUMP HIM.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> I don't see anything wrong with this but how do I reason with them?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i would hang out with friends and let him wonder where you are and what you're doing.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> Get over it and do your homework!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> for some, it feels like falling.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> TO GIVE ANYONE A REASON TO KISS EVER NOTICE THE HOTT ONES NEVER STAND UNDER IT THO ??
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> the guilt trip, the unsureness, it's all difficult, especially when you've got the mind of a girl.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> love simply flies away when hunger knocks.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> take him out for pizza or play sports.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> looking for a woman to date
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> I guess to put in just one word---kind.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> try to meet his relatives or someone friend who love him and make them as a mediator
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> Nope the speed of air comin' out is toooo much
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> I mean you can think a girl you know is hot.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> 11 real red roses 1 fake red rose i love you till the last one dies
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> We're not best friends, but anyway......
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Go to a gym (they're working out, and it's coed).
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I just realized you said how, that's good.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Then...no one else will appear in ur dream
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> You need to find a guy who actually cares about women ^_^.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> try it out my TOP 5 -- it works.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> Every time I look into my girlfriend's eyes, I can see the beach.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Perhaps ur not as snuggly as yahoo ans, where's he now, why r u on the comp?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> i dont think they all do but i would guess that a bunch of them do
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> so she left me high and dry.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> re you willing to fight till the end?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> If you truly do want her back, then you want her to be happy no matter what.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> You're not cheating, you're just outsourcing your orgasms.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> You probably can't do it without offending him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> remember actions speak louder than words.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> it could happen to you too.... just put yourself in his shoes and judge yourself!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> yes som time ilike to be alone
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> that was better than a man
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Avoid worn-out party pick ups like 'Do you want another drink?'
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> its like a trampoline...  only two can be in the air and one is bouncing
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> this is my first year ever having a guy w/ me for christmas.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> Sounds like he just wants to have sex with you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> :)  Just remember it's the rest of your life, how much do you love and trust each other.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> you kant expect neone to love you when they dont,,, keep it cool dude!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> My ex-girlfriend and i where alone at my house.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> Your father will eventually come around trust me!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Takes a long time to know you are a somebody & stop accepting anything less!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> well talk to him tell him to choose cause you are settingyour self up for hurt
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> i have been with the man i love for only 9 months and we are getting married march 25,2006
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> When the time is right WHAM ... you got hit.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Don't tell her she can't hang out with him or you've already lost.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> my mom asks for a list every year so we get something we want.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> STOP LOOKING SO HARD AND SHE WILL COME TO YOU!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> makes you feel like you didnt matter.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> dont u think we love our parents, grand parents.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> just forget that you had a very bad nightmare.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_30> tell him everything but the cheating with a friend part
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> Yes, long as you dont have it every day!!
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_40> yes you should stay with him maby time will fix it.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> If you like her and you feel shes interested yes.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> it frowns on women who just want to get freaky.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> like in my case, i dont mind doing laundry, but i HATE folding clothes and hanging them up.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Of course thats about the when i started liking people.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> But it would be great to marry a girl/boy who loves u and viceversa.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> If you like empty parking lots, then stick with them,
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> he knew it wasnt right but he didnt want to be alone.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> so i hope what i said helps!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> I even don't know if he is alive.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> You just learned to french kiss.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> it would&#92;could be awkward but i think i would rather have a girl ask me out
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> I dont think its harmful at all.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> Definitely clean, that freshly showered smell, the smell of soap and water and clean clothes...does it every time!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> AND THAN IF THE OTHER BITCH IS THERE YOU AND YOUR MOTHER KICK HER ASS.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> invite her over and pop in a porno
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> men are individuals just as we are.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_30> hey i wanna be your friend
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> I'm sorry that guy was such a butthole, no woman deserves that!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_5> Try Dooney & Bourke- they have some cute bags in the $135-$150 range
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> I don't care what anybody says, somebodys gonna lose a trailer.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> tell him/her how come its over/gone.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> so ask urself wut is luv.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> I'm sorry that guy was such a butthole, no woman deserves that!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Try Dooney & Bourke- they have some cute bags in the $135-$150 range

<NbChars_195> <LevSim_25> tell him/her how come its over/gone.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_40> so ask urself wut is luv.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_25> if you wait too long, you will have over thought it.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> maybe he wants to be friends but really would want it to go farther but isn't ready yet.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_10> THE EYES, THE WALLET AND THEN THE EARS.
<NbChars_265> <LevSim_20> But if he's not, dump him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> it don't need any third party applications
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_10> Get hurt physically or something else?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> How do you get back at a cheater?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_10> actually i think that one of the states that start with an 'i' does marriages for gay couples
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> me and the guy broke up and his friend asked me out tho afterwards.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> That along makes me not want his sorry ass.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> Get hurt physically or something else?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> How do you get back at a cheater?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> actually i think that one of the states that start with an 'i' does marriages for gay couples
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> me and the guy broke up and his friend asked me out tho afterwards.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> If you whine he'll think you're a b****.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> depends on who you are doing it with
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> and ofcourse a sense of humor.....chocolate and wine never hurts!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> And, of course, they are young men...they want sex.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> if he's afraid of committment, then i don't know what you could do.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> THING'S MIGHT CHANGE ANY MOMENT FOR THE GOOD.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> love is what u make it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> you just try to forget everything good, and remember everything bad.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> I Dont Know, And trust me I have had sex before !
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> and how much total you have to work with.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Ya if you live in Alabama hahahhahah
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> if he gets nervouse around you and says stupid things.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Take 'em to chuckie cheese or whatever 5 year-olds like now.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> suppose he's a duck hunter...buy her some waders.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Lose him, and don't give it up.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> and you know that he is a married man.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> It is like you are kissing their..................
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> And I know shes been hanging out with him lately.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> SAy somthing like hey ya want to grab somthing to eat?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Try setting her up on a blind with a guy with some morals...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> cuz its not about him or u its about us (the both of u) make sure its real  ps.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> You got it all wrong, hon!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> when you feel hurt, that means, you care for that person.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> and, i have to admit, after really good sex, you get a certain feeling of primal possessiveness, i.e.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Some people are into it and some are not.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> no im one and i wouldnt.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Um...no, unless you want to go illegal.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> Some people are into it and some are not.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> or else he is dead....either way, he's gone!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> no im one and i wouldnt.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> Feel good that you just did it!!!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> Kaely thinks you are a dork.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> totally i ask for naughty things all the time :)
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> If it worked once why not again?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> But it's like any other group of people, compatibility isn't always easy.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> My work here is done, toodles!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Then you should GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Just give it to him straight.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Be there for her in the good and bad as you always have.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> What this do is make the girl want u more because it become like a test for them.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> Or, if he does like guys, jump his bones!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> moving on, being happy, screwing his friend, becoming lesbian, please give some good maybe even funny advice.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> OK Cupid has lots of strange tests and matches you with people based on them.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> Family are generally a pretty good place to start...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> i think you should keep trying.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> and the woman at home cat must aint good to him anymore.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Lil hugs and kisses touchin thing like that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> why do u need a free girl fiend???
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> its true, most women want to know that they are...well wanted, and sexy.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> let her know what you were thinking from the start.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Is that what you are asking?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> im sorry i thought u were gay
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> Or an average looking girl that actually cares about other things other than herself.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> maybe try to convince him you want a lot more than just a hook-up.
<NbChars_460> <LevSim_15> all for one and one for all.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_30> I had an ex who cheated, lied, etc.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> don't let any kids see your dirty little christmas list!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> You just have to keep looking.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> Further u need not to tell, he himself will tell U.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> This is how the whole gettin a girl thing work, girls like nice guys as friends only.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> Hi,   I am Kong, some call me King.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Remember there are plenty more fish in the sea...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> BUT if you do not mean than you should not say it.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> people try to hard and usually end up with something they dont want later on down the road
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> Someone out there is going to find you attractive no matter what you look like.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> start bangin someone else .......she is most likley
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> Now it seems like just an ordinary, everyday thing!
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_40> Do you just not like him?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Then you won't have to worry about the label, you'll be Husband & Wife again!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> Even if he's not gay, it doesnt have to mean it's cheating!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Don't bother dating, just renew the marriage & MAKE IT WORK!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> i think that u should talk to him about it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i did once, many years ago.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> So... yea.. it just all depends on who the person is and how honest they are with you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> No gift, thats a big mistake.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> If so, weigh out all the pro's and con's (make an acutal list on paper!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> You can't have it both ways.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> you'll never know unless you ask.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> If you really love him you wold reconize that size doesnt matter
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> dont worry hell come to you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> I believe that some do, some don't.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> how do you know that if you get with he won't do the same thing to you?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> if it doesnt make you happy why are you doing it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> If you really love him you wold reconize that size doesnt matter
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> dont worry hell come to you.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> I believe that some do, some don't.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> how do you know that if you get with he won't do the same thing to you?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> if it doesnt make you happy why are you doing it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I knew how to keep my apartment neat, did laundry, etc.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_90> Think of something he always bugs you about when your around.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> Beyond that, it's freakin' nobody's business!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> they always think the grass is greener on the other side.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_90> what ways can u give a guy pleasure?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> would you do me the honor of bieng my wife?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_20> Belive me, what ever you decide you can handle it!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> I don't know a guy anywhere that would like a poem unless it's about beer and boobs.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> just leave be honest and straight up tell them that its not gonna work.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> like emails and stuff like that?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If she Acts like that, You probably shouldnt be friends with her.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> some want it every day and some want it twice a month.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> and the toucing things have really impoved.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> gals cheat less cos they scare being cheated by the guy she try to cheat.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> it sounds like you love the person but feel that they dont love you.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> turn-on..intelligence, sense of humor, great teeth and smile, tall sexy man, men cologne  turn-off..sarcasm, ignorance, bad hygeine, materialistic, unemployed
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> So sex it up, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Life never turns out the way people want it too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> the love they deserved to have
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> When men talk to women they have to lie a lot...
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_25> as a catholic i say after but as a hott lonly chic is say before
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> But, u marry ur life-partner only.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> When you give of yourself, and allow yourself to love, and the other person just isn't there with you...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Find out what it is & try to accomodate...it might help in more ways than you know...  Good luck!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> His favorite television series on DVD ?

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> what does this have to do with singles and dating?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> buy her a K&N filter charger for her car!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> first ask the basic 'w' questions: who was she?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Whatever you do, don't give up your friendship with your guy friend just to make your boyfriend happy.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> can you guys please tell me where is a nice place to have fun... san francisco or lake taho...
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> For the same reason that women do ... ask any lesbian!

<NbChars_175> <LevSim_25> U find what your not looking for.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> we rnt suposed 2 meet people here....thats stupid

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> Than well the rest is up to you :D
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> It would probably bother me if he didnt.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> of course u can love a person even if you are not married.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> so, be honest and try your luck!

<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> First you have to get yourself busy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Anyway we all exagerate don't we -- let me know how it goes - info@ianjennings.com
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Show her that you took the time to make it special.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> shouldnt be that hard they're easier to spot :P
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Cause if there is one then it will be plenty more to come
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> this is you just heve to wait for her
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> if you are a starving artist...don't spend 300 dollars.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> The true and honest love always win!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I want a man with confidence.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> Heck.. you just might find Mrs.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> you do not have to be married to say i love you
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> high school (according to my brother).
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> It means I'm just not that into you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> fight ur urges friends are worth more than cheap thrills.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> my muscles and my eyes girls go crazy for it   wat r your three best features i'm curious ???????????
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> have u gotten him anything for his bday?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> if you do tell her dont go into great details, mostly the mom part.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Moral of the story, don't be something you're not... be yourself ;-).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Do the I don't what to screw up with you line.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> SO MANY THINGS TO DO HERE IF YOU SPEAK PORTUGESE..
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Yeah, but dont show him that you really really like him then he might freak out!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Have you ever asked a girl out?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> plus if she lets you lick her feet then you might have to fulfill her weird fetish too.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Wow, didn't know I could go so long.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> is there some unwritten rule about the girl never saying i love you first?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> depent how deep you know each other.... about common interest and a lot more....
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> yes it is ok to fall in love with a young single guy
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> even if the man isn't gay, it's not considered cheating.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> And I'd strap on a six shooter and make her call me Tom Selleck for spite!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> but shameless flirting never hurt anyone.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> Ask him if he is gay?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> Maybe you just haven't found the right girl or maybe you haven't noticed the right girl.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> you can tell him its over thats what i do
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> with the following words coming  out of your mouth...would you go out with me?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Well you might have scared him a bit, especially if you  got something expensive.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Mine is Doc and hers is Kimber
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Dont feel bad, my son is 31 and still single.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> GET OUT AND SMELL THE COFFEE.....
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> that way, they can leave without any problem.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> This one doesn't care about you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> just tell her, or write her a note.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Is it because, I'm a giant gorilla and she's a woman?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> in other words, if your dating a gigalo, don't kid yourself into thinking he's prince charming.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> all I can say is you know her and what she likes.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Get ready for an odd little story!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> no...it doesn't matter the size...it definitely is how you use it!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> IT'S A FACT...I CAN DEAL WITH IT...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> well personaly you need to pick.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> If there is nothing you disagree on can you just file and be done.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> Well guys in a nutshell are assholes.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> But if he treats you or the baby bad then I would say NO!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> Also when we kiss no matter how badly I want to or he wants to move we dont.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Well I don't see why there's such a fuss over sex before marriage.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Maybe she's got her eyes on some other guy and you just stepped in her line of vision...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> if you hurt all the time then you need to find someone else.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> And trust me.......you so don't want to mess with her!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> Oh mothers........ where did that come from?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> maybee you dont know what lonely means
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> and anyone that says they love you would never put you in harms way.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> If you love the woman get married.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> coz u have it in ur ID catchme.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> Get to know the girl...no matter whether she's larger or smaller, if the connection is there, looks won't matter!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> She may just like you back!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> If you love the woman get married.
<NbChars_315> <LevSim_25> coz u have it in ur ID catchme.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> good cute body & style & their face & ec.

<NbChars_235> <LevSim_25> She may just like you back!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> You just have to guess and hope for the best.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> out to dinner and then go have fun and do something like bowling
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> sounds to me like someones being led on.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> yuo ten to get peace from praying.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> I don't want her to be in my wedding.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Well, whatever you do, don't have one of your parents call to break up with him for you!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i will know by; the care and feeling she shows around me
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> And if they think they are, it's a very good indication that they aren't.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> is only foolish men who cheat
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> find out what she really wants, and be that if you can.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> not unless he has no desire to talk to her.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> its frusterating, but then again...a blast!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> Tiger: Don't listen to any of them, they are all wrong.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_55> Sry, yall- this is like my 4th post.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> stop wasting your time and his and just leave already.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> There is this guy i like and we are kinda dating but we havent made it offical.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> Now I just get him things he'll have fun with.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Becuz, We are trying to train you to do wut ever we want
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> you dont need someone there making it bad.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Personally I run down the street an get me a Big Mac and get my tummy full/
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> maybe he just likes you and is trying to fill the void?...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Most of the nice gals are married.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> I THINK THAT AT THAT AGE, YOU ARE JUST BEGINING TO LIVE.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> but i wouldn't try to impress her by being just that b/c relationships aren't all about humping.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> If he wants to be more than friends with her then he won't tell her what you said.

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> ignore him and forget about it....revenge is not worth it
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> I like clubs because they are loud and women always go in groups.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> to some women i`m in between it kinda matters it kinda doesnt matter
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> OuT TO DINNER is always good....but dont take her to ur house...take her OUT
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> He cheated, how do I get rid of it?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> Yes, and she became my wife.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> if u like a girl dont dont dont get to know her as a friend 1st.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> girls do that anyway, whether they are conscious of it or not.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Wait till you find the right one that you love!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> and you can start a conversation.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_35> you canalways step to him first
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> your perfect guy will come at the perfect time
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> 5th: u don't care what they look like or anything,and u can't name y u like them.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> And oh yeah, wear something short.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> Come on guys, we are not picking on you, its a known fact!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> and if you really want to get to know me call me at 307 351 2765
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> let the kid believe what they believe.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> When she keeps flirting with you.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> Come on guys, we are not picking on you, its a known fact!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> and if you really want to get to know me call me at 307 351 2765
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> let the kid believe what they believe.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> as a girl, I'm gonna say it's pretty hard for me.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> When women talk to women they lot a lot...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> from that it self you can tell how she is being true with you?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_10> THAT'S NO REASON TO DUMP A BF.UNLESS YOUR A MATERIAL GIRL.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> sure she does...until he gets bored with her and moves on to his next conquest.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> women  had self esteem by being a good mom and wife.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> ?and why would you want someone who can so easily be taken from the guy they are with??
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_35> if still can't tell write him a letter.
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_25> then blurt it out like a joke.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> is there something going on with them?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> its a big step especially with a shy girl.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> I gotta have it all, love and everything else.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> Some men freak out about that much responsibility.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> but there could be tons of possibilities why she is like that.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> But i wish I did Maybe because we're so different and always trying to impress one another.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_45> It's just a feeling that starts in my gut kinda thing...
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> perhaps your scaring guys off... good luck to you
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> So I don't know what to do .
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> no baby i see its free good
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Gvie her time to feel 'at home'.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> only you will know if he truly loves you or not
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> get her a gift card so you don't have to worry about anything
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> Oh BTW, I'm not really that butchy, kinda in between..haha...but anyways, just had to add that in there...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> im a man, i like it when my women shove the boo-ahs in my face
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> Ok, this is something I know about, this is all I can say, HONESTY IS THE BEST POLICY.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> true true...  it comes it goes and no one knows...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> She doesn't play, but I do.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> I would become a sex master, after that I would get married and teach my wife all about it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> So, they had sex & the woman left him.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> danceing, then go to the moves!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Right, no, but is he really blowing you off?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> regarding what is wrong w/ him..... unknown.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> But some are into big girls.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> but then if you just happen to see her and liked her then you could observe her actions.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> fyi... he's sitting behind me answering questions as we speak.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> that magic only exists in fairy tails.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> they seem so happy to talk among themselves and nothing else???
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> I see too many women like this ALL THE TIME!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> If not, that sucks but at least you'll know, and she'll be happy.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> But all in all do something different.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> and some ladies wonder why there isn't a faithful guy out there.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> First, if he loves it...respect him.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> Wear something sexy but not slutty.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> its a way way of showing love like any other way.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> !Ha Ha Ha!I don't mean that.But go to blind date,Yahoo Personals, or Google personals
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I still wanted to send it to him but I never got an response.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> pretend that she does not exsist.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> try asking him for a reason.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> just go for it...even though i think u should start from 8th grade and over
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Once there keep in the center of the action - don't hide in the kitchen etc.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> STAINLESS STEEL SET WHICH WILL BE USEFUL FOR THEIR DAY TO DAY USE .
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Should I tell her now, I don't want her in it?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> You dont you each have to move on.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> Girls seem to pick each others b/f's.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> Firstly - there are plenty men who like bigger women - it's all a matter of personal taste.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> wat he does is his thing.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_90> I cannot go back to someone like that can I?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> He will probably cheat on you again.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Now she is talking to this new guy and I found out that she's hanging out with him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> There is so much more both of you have....... take the time to find it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> i don't trust these online poeple search companies.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> I, my self have been told don't look, she will find you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I saw him naked with her.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_50> Lets kiss and find out  ;)
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> If u look for love u never find it.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_30> I will tell you a secret..
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_35> Call me for more Questions at 307 351 2765
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> What if you hug all your friends when you say hi?
<NbChars_335> <LevSim_20> take a chance and do it
<NbChars_310> <LevSim_25> look her up or just look for her.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> Move on and get a life.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> and next time don't be so stupid and say things that you will regret.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> GOD SAVES THE BEST FOR LAST
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> (at the end ask him if u still could talk about it personally to make it formal... =)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> That girl is a little bit my friend.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> But don't give them that i love you stuff because thats a turn off from the start....Be confident!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> i don't think there is any thing wrong as long as u luv that person
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> talk to her in loving manners, but dont be too pushy.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> Do what ur heart tells you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I can't stop thinking about girls that i know , Is it okay for me to have sex ?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> (What if kids aren't even possible?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> SEX & ATTENTION -THEY ARE TO YOUNG TO KNOW WHAT THEY WHANT.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> should i just try and ask a girl out at my school
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> ive planned only a few but my input is 7-10g's.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Pass on him some hints of ur liking.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> something she will love for ever   merry christmas   ...... comeing from the haert
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> If you love this guy, it doesn't matter.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> when you are mature enough to understand your own feelings
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_25> Yes, he's been cheating on you.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_20> i know what im talking about.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> so tell him and then start making a list.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> no, but i would be-friend them!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> And that your friends are ONLY friends!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> I hate the short hair for girls.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> your own hand, or your sock?)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Why can't MEN stay home and watch SPORTS on there home TV without his friends..??
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> I dont think men should hit women at all.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> why not stay home and talk!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If you hurt someone like that then you dont love them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> it is if you can't tell your girl friend/wife about it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> not all girls like rich boys and some like fat boys i hate the rich type.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> well there are probably websites for that.. they are plenty of single woman though.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> who know he may doing something nice to you?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> GET A LIFE AND DO YOUR SCHOOL WORK
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> buy  a red cheek poweder to increase shyness cuz shy girls are amazing
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> Don't bother getting too upset with this.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> It depends on if you ever plan on meeting
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> one has the word word in it and the other has the word note in it
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Come on.....everybody has at least one insane one.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> and make it very clear thats what you want once you've got him on hooked.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> It's not that guys don't want to help.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> let him know what you feel.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Chances are  He will be back
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> The wallet is a plus though =)
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> I know it sounds kinda stupid to be talking to yourself, but it really helps.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> send the kids with your spouse.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> or anything else for that matter?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Of course you don't want to pay.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> man, am I the only one to do this.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> Well, when I stop talking about it & do it right in front of him...loudly...he normally gets the message.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> That's not horrible, it's just practical.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> WEll if you dont want to flirt ( if your shy especially ) then don't.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Just think of it as a boob trifecta.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> or is it just a thing to u?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> girls don't want a guy that they can run over.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I'm thick and i've never had a problem.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> boyfriends and girlfriends come and go but your true friends will always be there for you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> 23 is very young and you have a lot of growing up to do.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> Can't go wrong w/ a single rose
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> Well did you boink the guy or what?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> my parents don't like it my mom sayies well if they make you happy and my dad hates it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> now i have a man that i am seeing that would never even think about another girl.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> see it for what it is.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> i sounded just like you not too long ago.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> tell your girl i bet she will think so too.!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> does it mean to trust care and respect somebody?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> He's an ex because he's an EX...no more!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> If I cheat on my boyfriend because he never puts out?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> probably he likes you but something is holding him back.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> Hope that helps, rock her world for me bro.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> As for those that don't.. it's their loss :)
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> Well mainly it is just him.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> If your asking that question than YOU ARE GAY!!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> because they might like you and dont want you to know things.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Do anyone know what I should do?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> They also don't like men of other races and colour, but you know what?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> People at school think I am a nerd
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> second none of my lesbian friends hate me, they just dont find men attractive.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> until one comes along and they start beggin and pleading.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> if you dont feel hurt, that just goes to show that you dont care about him or her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Tell him that you don't want him to do that anymore.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> is this the kid of relationship you want from a boyfriend.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> NO---as long as they have an orgasm ---who cares how much u weigh!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> you dony hsve to move to africa, they are everywhere.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> Pick one up and give it a try!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> i really like him and he asked me out last year before we did anything i told him no.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> Raising kids as a GAY IS wrong and immoral period!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Good luck with the boyfriend & happy holidays.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Why not he just might be Mr.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> y bother in the first place..
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> i guess the only consolation to that is honesty.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> i no thats how my friends are but i don't lie i'm already good.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> Us women are no so complex creatures really....  Good Luck!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> If he says no and you believe him, then there you go.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> How can I forget it all in my mind?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> Why don't you just ask her and then go from there.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Sounds like an excuse........well, you can always kick the kids out somewhere.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> give her a nice and simple gift she'll love it
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_30> If your love hurts... let it go.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_10> WE MEN ARE INSECURE...REPEAT AFTER ME.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> move on,, if she wanted to find you she would have...
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_50> just be charmin and sweet girls like that
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> If they are just friends, he will tell her what you said.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> ?....gee, If it's his, he'll know..lol
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> 1st consider getting a dictionary so that u r able to spell the word anniversary.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> What's so funny is he's 20yrs.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> a guy who really cares for you will make the time to call and say hi.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> do you forgive him and stay or do you figure it as a love-crime and walk??
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_55> stupid question, try writing it better.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> He just want to use you WHENEVER.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> I LIKE TO THINK THEY WILL UNDERSTAND AND PROTECT YOU.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> so plz take right step and gv deep thinking to take any decision.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Didn't you promise to love honor, etc.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If you do not mean it do not say it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Tell me how things go .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> If you have to ask, she probably is.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> there's nothing really bad flirting to a guy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> i did not like kissing men or haveing sex with them.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> I'm a guy... and teh poems I like most are limerick poems...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> I pick it up and just stare at it.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> Then, hand the girl a drink, even if she already has one in her hand, say here, have another.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> never do a movie on a first date.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> (that's even more modern in thinking).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> let her know that you would rather leave then to cheat because you care that much about her.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> One day they want space and the next day they want a relationship!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> but identifying it is a whole different matter
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> if she freaks out around a firearm, i wouldn't want anything to do with her anyway.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> For some one to say 'I LOVE YOU they just need to love u.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> give it another try, sometimes it takes time, if u like em dont give up
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> choose one from ur neighbours house man an denjoy ur holiday with her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> But most women prefer it to be just them two.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Dont waste your life over one girl!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> SHIT I WOULD DATE THEM BOTH.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> First of all, what kind of guy says he would never ***** as you put it?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> think about it..but before it- smile please!!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Look around, grab whatever tickles your fancy and have a ball.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> yr going to be with 1000 cats and rats if dont stop it
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> because they think that there is something that they are missing.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> ya got to love getting older.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> you deserve someone that will only look and want you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> BUT IF NOT YOU SHOULD PROBABLY TALK TO A GRANDPARENT OR GREAT FRIEND.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> I WANT TO BE YOUR FRIEND
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Now I'm with a girl I totally trust and she and I both are very happy.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> just dont show that u like him.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> first u make it sure n test him thn u must take decision to brk off.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> Just don't let him pressure you into stuff you do not want.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> of course I would date outside my race.Everybody needs lovin no matter what
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> I want a fat and hairy obese woman that belittles me im public.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> DO U HANG WITH YOUR FRIENDS?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> THE QUESTION SHOULD BE AM I IN LOVE WITH HIM NOT DO I LOVE HIM.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_90> Do the household chore she hates most!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Don't let him and he won't.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> say hey momacta let me hit that
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> you probably havent been looking in the right places dont worry theres someone for everyone>
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> take what you can from it.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> you may not realize it but you men are just as confusing as us women!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Till then, you hang in there!
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_35> It is all in your hand
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> It's not a good thing to date your ex's sibling!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> It depends if she likes you too
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> if you guys are okay with the religious difference, then marry.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Go look up some e e cummings  There's tons of good poetry that guys like.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i am not this way, but my husband is.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> some men are just stuiped like that
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_45> But lil mamma it is doable.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> personally if i were her, i would want to go to a movie and then go out to eat.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Just spend some time hanging out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Just accept him and be friends.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> He usually buys stuff if he wants it, so he doesn't need anything.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> I don’t like him, he is no good for you, or you can do better than that!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> ya do what you want it is your life
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> It's ok to be afraid, but don't let that stop you!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> Just accept him and be friends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> He usually buys stuff if he wants it, so he doesn't need anything.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> I don’t like him, he is no good for you, or you can do better than that!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> ya do what you want it is your life
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> It's ok to be afraid, but don't let that stop you!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> it depends if you love him or not.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Now think whether it could happen with your ex...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> be a friend dont let your feelings for her get u further away from ur goal.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> feed that person that should keep them quiet for a while
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> ; ) That should shut them up.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I love sleeping with me wife.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> If you have to ask yourself that question, then there's a good chance
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> I love him so much and don't want the flame to die.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> Trust me having sex after marriage does not mean your not cool, weak or even stupid.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> becuz they had it with someone else b4
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> but just remember, it does matter
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> tell me if u found an answer
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> I THINK THAT AGE AINT NOTING BUT A NUMBER.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Me, I'm not sure if I wanna get married any time soon...I'm young and with little experience.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I have a feeling shes seeing another guy but i'm nt sure.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> But this is only my opnion okay..
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> so that every night he has to lie in the bed that his girlfriend and bestfriend had sex in.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> I look to see what keeps her going from day to day.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> give them a hint or flirt a little then tell that u like him/her
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> No your not a bad person you just have needs.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I wish i was that lucky
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> then you need to set a budget.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Yeah, good thing I like twilight zone music
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> IF HE IS NOT WORTH IT.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> When I told him movies, carnivals, eating out, a concert, he said So, you ARE all about spending money!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> and he won't already have a mrs. right.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_5> dummy that was a dumb question!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> Because men lie just because they think they can get away whit it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> Best advice is just not to ask guys out.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> i don't think its true that lesbians hate men.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> I agree, there is good and bad... Just get to know them.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> it gets more detailed but this is just an overveiw of it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> give it to me if you dont know what to do with it.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> my friend wants to know (maybe that friend of mine is me...)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> I'm in one now and straight LOVING IT!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> If you just want to play but aren't the serious minded type - tell her that too.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Then I toned it back a bit.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> no that's hot...   what's up sexy?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> a person only has one sould mate, one true love.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Matter of fact, me and my boyfriend'll meet ya up there cause we're gonna get married too!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> just tell him/her honestly how u feel..... or don't let her/him to feel you spirit anymore...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> because there is no one good enough for a true nice guy
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> go pink girly girls love pink, and butterflies.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_20> slap a libel suit on her ass
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I think u got the question wrong.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_10> what  the  hell   you  talkin  about
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> we are not the same as even a few generations back.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> But don't waste tons of time doing it.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> But always communicate with her, and if she loves you, she'll brush this guy off...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_10> because they are from two different planets!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> what  the  hell   you  talkin  about
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> we are not the same as even a few generations back.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> But don't waste tons of time doing it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> But always communicate with her, and if she loves you, she'll brush this guy off...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> because they are from two different planets!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> i wouldnt do that to my beast freind  if iwould do that iwould confese and say that iam sorry
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_25> fox theater jan. 1 2006 playing?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> you should let it go and be friends justlike she sayd.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> If you're so interested, why don't you ask him out?
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> If not you will loose both.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> U should buy her a   Underwear !!!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> When they ask me why dont i get married i just say what for?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Too bad you don't have an Avatar.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> Try and get him to realize your not cheating first if that dosent work DUMP HIM.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Don't worry though, there are people out there who don't cheat.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> no offense but she doesnt sound too interested.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> There's also this: guys just don't like bushy privates.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_20> I hope Kaely Lykins likes me!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_5> yea cause cause i have 2 home girl and we r
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> no offense but she doesnt sound too interested.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> There's also this: guys just don't like bushy privates.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> Like mouth, just lips, just tounge, etc.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> I hope Kaely Lykins likes me!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> yea cause cause i have 2 home girl and we r
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> it depends on how she feels if shes stayed for that long i bet its good to get married.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> have fun, but don't date again, not until you're 100% sure you can't get him back.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> it is a guy thing..don't fall into that trap..take control..and you call the shots.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if they are single, they probably want to stay that way.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I don't understand why some girls like those guys at all.
<NbChars_250> <LevSim_35> Get a puppy, or watch the American Pie movies.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> if i were you, just ask him in a flirty way like are you checking me out?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> But my friend playa to playa if you get caught up in the mix.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> (at least that's what it sounds like)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> So, why would we only love one man or woman?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> try to get everyone to care
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> i dont have any boyfriend so can't tell u anything.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but secretly they were still going out and i didnt know.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> this is my most embarrasing moment  leave comments plz.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> IF THAT DOESN'T WORK THEN JUST ASK HER.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> there is no amount on love.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> we danced together and kissing, we didnt talk much but we feel like we talked so much already.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Why so quick to throw away another marriage?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> I would also add...  a kiss !
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> set a date.... and go from there
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> she is a sick woman and shame on her sorry
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> I hope one day there won't be a need to ask this question!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> dam how do you not know that?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> why hell no.. he should dumb you for being such a shallow bitch
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> There are a few things that I just get SO tired of asking about & I get annoyed.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> she is a sick woman and shame on her sorry
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> I hope one day there won't be a need to ask this question!
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_35> dam how do you not know that?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> why hell no.. he should dumb you for being such a shallow bitch
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> There are a few things that I just get SO tired of asking about & I get annoyed.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> nope dont think all men cheat.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Take an ice cube & crush it with ur feet & say now that I have broken the ice......
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> If he is cheating on you and with other girls then tell him what the problem is and leave.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> i think that you could go to the movies.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Go out and buy something sexy to wear (even if you just wear it around the house).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> So explain if you want advice please ;)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> if you wouldn't marry them...don't date them
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> coz it very easy to say but difficult to stay on words.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> So there is only the girl who wants things differently.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> ye love can be at first sight
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> If it were me, you'd be packing your bags and hitting the road...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> How you r treating and trust your girl friend?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> You call but she does not pick up.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> if he didn't find women attractive, he also wouldn't have much interest in you!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Guess what, I lost my incentive to do these things.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> And also about playing with gadgets.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> and dont act like a stereotypical floozy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> figure out how much money you will have total.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> If they say no, that's it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> i have a friend that lost his dad last year, you just got to calm him down.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> nothing gets a girl going like horsepower... at least it works for me!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> Why don't women like short guys?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> i dont know what to do
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> It is online dating, not line dating...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> If a casual friend is asking they are just making conversation.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> IF SHES WILLING TO AS FAR AS THIS, WHAT WILL SHE BE WILLING TO DO NEXT???
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Yep and there is nothing there..just this empty space between your ears
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> you don't need much to turn a guy on...we are always on
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> i think that is the point of the drug..not to just stay hard but also to last long
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I know lots of people who use it, and at least some of them are looking for relationships.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> dont let your relationship go bad.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> ....  because I can see my self in them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> it means they don't want to hurt your feelings because you obviously care more than they do
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> but i do believe in love at first sight.it happens rarely .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> He wouldn't like it if you looked at other men, so tell him that and work it out.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> If they ask, I would recommend saying, Oh, you!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> If you have crushes on guys and can't imagine ever being w/ a girl= gay.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> and she still shouln't mess around she should just leave ya!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> If you like this guy, go out with him.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> SO STOP SWEATING AND START LAUGHING CAUSE IS SURE CAN BE FUNNY AT TIMES.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> sweet talk and get them drunk
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> i know i liked women from a young age.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> DONT RUIN SOMEONES LIFE FOR YOUR OWN GAIN!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> The same thing hapened with me, he cheated on me with my BEST FRIEND.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> i really could just use some advice...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> sweet talk and get them drunk
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> i know i liked women from a young age.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> DONT RUIN SOMEONES LIFE FOR YOUR OWN GAIN!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> The same thing hapened with me, he cheated on me with my BEST FRIEND.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> i really could just use some advice...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> dress conservativly, but still make yourself look good.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> i mean how can emotions create pain?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Because they watch too much MTV... :P
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> He should trust you enough that you only love him!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> can you send me your answers to timitimika@yahoo.com?
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> yahoo personals is good, so is match.com
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_10> AND I FIND THICK GIRLS VERY SEXY.SEXYNESS COMES FROM PERSONALITY AND SHARM.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> (which is to saying, loving person a doesn't take away from your love for person b.)
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> well not everybody is the same there still people around with moral
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_35> If you both think it is ok then it is ok.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> If u have to take a break so he can go on w/ his life, then do that.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> so she obviously does not care if you get sick or not.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Just because she asked for the moon, doesn't mean she'll get it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_90> When I first married I was almost 31.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> being a virgin isn't as bad as many people think it is.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Cheap= Linens and things has great gifts!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> that is what you call a dumb ass!!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> If he cheats once, he will cheat again.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Even when she's home, she doesn't really hang out with her family.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> it is the invidibel (it is in the blood)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> be cautious if you have a hard time getting away from somebody.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> HONEY!YOU KISS JUST LIKE YOUR MOTHER :-0
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> if the men is a good person he will take u and kids together.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> My little brother justed turned 21, so I hope this helps.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> NO, you need to get a new boyfriend
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i beleive in lust and yearning at first sight.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> -What do I not like about him?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> If you guys hang out AFTER that, that means he likes you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> internet  ,  street corners  ,   house of ill repute ,  high school/college  ,  mall
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> sports bar during any major event
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> DO NOT appear to just be nice to get her back.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> A: It is OK and even advised.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> what i feel is dat my man need to stop trating me bad.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> sure, if you are in a relationship,why not?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> After all they are just toys and you can always play with them on your own.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_70> That what is to be in love
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_25> If you have crushes on guys and girls = bi.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> Gruesome wicked...  What girl in her right mind would ever dream of letting a python go, well, there... Yuck!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> I guess it kinda depends on the kiss to.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> if you're a gentleman all the time she may not feel attractive.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> keep dreaming and she will be there
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> IT BECOMES PART OF YOU THAT'S WHY WHEN IT IS TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU IT REALLY HURTS....
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Food and flowers YOU like, it's your day don't worry about what other people may want.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Who cares what they are up to?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Umm do you own a toothbrush
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> It seems you guys have good chemistry..online.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> My favorite is West Coast Swing.

<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> Or take a trip down there.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> think your name says it all.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> But give me credit for trying.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> OK this guy that I know likes making other people cry.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> they are out there... just gotta find them.. just like i'm wondering where all the faithful men are at
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> sometimes ya gotta be a jerk in life to get what you want.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> It came with a price - - my brokenheart!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I used to be that way because I didn't trust my partner.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> ), and sit down and have a nice heart to heart.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> What do girls really want in a guy?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> if that seems to impersonal ask.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> look up everything you need to know at the links below
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> I LIVE IN BRAZIL BUT I BEEN THERE BEFORE LAST YEAR.BUT BRAZIL IS FUN TOO!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> hand bag,makeup,shoes or anything that she really dream about it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> There are lots of great guys out there.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_40> It is just not your time to shine.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> love isnt hard to find, its just hard to accept.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_50> have your family look and ask.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> Life's too short to wonder and have regrets later!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> I gaze at his smile,, if he has a nice SMILE... i cant resist ;)
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> I don't skinny girls; I prefer BBWs.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Its not how big it is , but how you use it!!!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> eventually your dad will get over it
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> You should tell him that he is a DISGRACE to MEN!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> MEN DO IT ALL THE TIME GIRL.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> Other men- well- they just don't look good no matter WHAT they do to their hair!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> But I'm guessing you mean that you don't want to get too wild.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_10> But that's just my two cents!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_10> how do you really know when you love someone?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> MEN DO IT ALL THE TIME GIRL.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Other men- well- they just don't look good no matter WHAT they do to their hair!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> But I'm guessing you mean that you don't want to get too wild.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> But that's just my two cents!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> how do you really know when you love someone?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> you could ask any questions you like, if you know the girl.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> first you have to love and respect the person youre going to make love to.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Nuttin wrong with shaving.. but the snake thing has GOT to hurt!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> and by the way sex is not always penetration!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> doing it sideways is also good b/c the d*ck really gets in there.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> anywhere... you dont have to specify that you are a xtian...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Just gotta love all those walking contradictions out there.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> we are best friend and love every minute that we spend together.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Hey didnt you know?A man grades his manhood according to the number of girls he has conquered.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> You deserve better, dont you think?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> not at all  it's all about who you fall in love with:)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> well you can find out by a lot of ways the easiest way is to ask her !!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> maybe give her a rose and some chocolate and tell her how much you love her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> u can let him talk to u when he feels that u want that
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> I really like to do that to I dont think it wrong, It think its very sexy and hor.ney.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> just be best friends with her daddy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> give it time, if she is truly using him he'll find out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> It is a hard thing to do but if you love the person then  it is so worth it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> tell your new girls about her b4 any thing goes beyond a first date.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> so jsut take this advice, at least one of you should use a condom.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_60> you said your shy use it to your advantage.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Would he get mad a you?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Do this out in a nice public resutrant don't ever become desprate.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> what a jerko, buy him socks and underware, the cheap ones too
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> If your not ready dont  do it even if that means breaking up with him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> nothing he was there before you he'll be there after you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Never in my life have I felt like I do now.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Make you stronger or destory you??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> yet, my ex had crooked a** teeth, it was him i liked so the teeth didn't bother me.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> go on you know you want to
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> Plus, it may be him that's doing the blushing!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> then you can go for it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> they say it, but they don't.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> geocities through yahoo lets or used to let you make a website for free.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> what kind of sick lover do you have.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> And she will NOT stop pushing herself at me.
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_30> if you act fake we'll know.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> Online dating sites, personals, church, library, bookstores, coffee shops, concerts, hobbies, gym, supermarket, etc... etc... etc...  Women are everywhere!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> but fidgeting and looking down and away is usualy a sign of lying.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> You learn to deal with him, if you love him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> Call her and talk about your day that works!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> So it is quite important that u shud b comfortable with urself.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> NO, LOVE DIED WITH THE SOULS OF THE MEEK
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> I made a mistake is no excuse.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> just go up to them we don't beat if you treat us right
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> I'm kinda a shy guy too, and noisey rooms don't help when you're trying to socialise.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> but if you really want to be happy ignorance is bliss
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if you're worried about hurting their feelings by not saying it, then you care, so tell them that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If you like her then yes.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Ask him to do something sometime, if he like's you he'll say yes.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> It depends on both of you!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> this will not always work, but you have to take the good with the bad.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> PS I'm a single guy Normal looking guy.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> If you tell both of them about the other, you all have choices, don't you?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> Not nasty, but it can be messy!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> It depends on both of you!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> this will not always work, but you have to take the good with the bad.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> PS I'm a single guy Normal looking guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> If you tell both of them about the other, you all have choices, don't you?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Not nasty, but it can be messy!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Okay -- this is without a doubt the wackiest response I have ever posted.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> also you might want to get to know him as a friend.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> messy, and she can get a nasty infection from it
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> Smile and don't do anything stupid.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> Believe me hon, there are plently of ugly and mean gay guys too.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> I like her a lot too What do i do?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Just tell him you like him.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Ignore the ones who only think about having sex with you.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> Because thats what it is ?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> now i'm with someone and have been for almost a year now.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> because the the left hand goes to your heart
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> THAN MAKE LOVE and one's more say I LOVE YOU
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Love always hurts and it never makes itself easy to understand!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> because many guys dont have feelings to cover up?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Get ONE good lookin' one and you'll be rollin' in phone numbers.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Because they figured out how easy we are...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> I don't so much just making eye contact or simply flirting..
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> nope what if she finds out your cheating
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Guys try to emulate their dads.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> cause a real man doesn't need sex, he needs a friend.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> they just never will until they loose you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> you can always try again once you desided hes done w/ his games.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> tell her you have a girlfriend already
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> There is nothing we do for fun.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> I guess you got your answer ;)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> I did not choose to not be gay, I am just not and I would not want to be.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Oh yes, he is too old for you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> sounds like you got your hand in your pants bro.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> or if thats hard to leave and come back to him later.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> start off with how was ur day at work.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_80> If you dont like wear it in right hand.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Dont forget the bedroom...keep the work up in there!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> As for the answer, WHO CARES!!!

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> or he may not be interested in you
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> BECAUSE IT IS CLOSET TO THE HEART
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Sometimes men are weird like that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> And one more thing - don't be surprised after she gets to know you if she asks you out.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> is it really necessary when you hear the tunes of pleasure
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> A fat wallet asnd a large ****.....good luck
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> I can give it up by sharing it with him/her
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_30> If it's that bad then get out.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> It really just depends on what both of you are looking for!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> at least untill you think he tires of her and then try to make a move.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> Just find someone right for you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> then he'll play until he goes to bed.

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Guys can get away with it - that's the answer.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> playful, who is not affraid to show his feelings to me.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> Once a cheater, always a cheater.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> A basketball game, class assignment, some crazy rumor.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> does the age of a man matter to any age female?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_5> EATING, SLEEPING, WATCHING FOOTBALL, TALKING TO FRIENDS....
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> you won't respect yourself later and he probably won't either.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> but hopefully you are friends or dating already.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> yea he is a sick perv and she doesnt know any better
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> I'm trying to tell her that if goes out with his friends why can't she????

<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> What can and should I do?

<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Busy in Work more n more and enjoying  life.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> When she says You Have Changed what does she mean!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> AS HARD AS IT IS,GIVE HER ANOTHER CHANCE, TRY TO WORK THING'S OUT FOR THE LAST TIME.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> go to yahoo personals & tell were you want him to be and it will tell you
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> Why would she want to spend time with a guy that is so boring?
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> I'm not quite sure, but I'm going to say yes because its ILLEGAL!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> if he's REALLY nice, then of course he would finish me first......
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> it depends, probably earlier if their parents wouldnt disown them for it
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> she is the kind of girl that i always dreamed of and that i always wanted.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> Why would she want to spend time with a guy that is so boring?

<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> White with bow already at the top for like $10-15 bucks!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> And that is the truth... no kidding!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> a guy could give me flowers and it means more to me then a ring anyday.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> too macho...but only coz some men try to conform
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> But this sounds like it is better to move on.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> i would say 14 or 15 and +
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> not asking just tempting to see if he goes for the bait.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> Good looking sometimes, but mostly just rude even when they do want to hook up with you!!
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> for this time i not sure where to go and have a nice experience whit him
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> what present that suitable to gv to her ?any idea ?
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_40> age is just a number unless its a crime.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> i am working on the same problem.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> talk to you about what, the weather?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> First ask her  I like you and wait for answer!!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> (I know from experience) Men don't know a good thing til it's gone sometimes.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> That & getting on with your life...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Mine did it behind my back a lot..it just started a ton of fights.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> I told her that I didn't approve so she said she didn't want to see me anymore.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> but somehow they always end up thinking you really like them.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> (I know from experience) Men don't know a good thing til it's gone sometimes.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_15> That & getting on with your life...

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> but somehow they always end up thinking you really like them.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> 2 wrongs don't make a right!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> also, y did you marry him if you guys didnt have anything to talk about?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> 4) Maybe he's a really nice guy and just wants to take it slow.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> if less than 5, it might not be that bad.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Not that I know of....try classmates.com or google their name.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> (nothing sexual tho) and if he goes for it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> just say hi you look formilyor
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> If she's simple make it simple...it's about her.

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> you don't have to do anything you don't want to.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> :) After that, I would leave it alone.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> mabbe she likes 2 c u wen u r angry!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> then you've got a bit of a problem!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> maybe because they are not worn on the right !
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> but side by side, a feelin'of frnship also got stronger, n she really became my frnd.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> on yahoo search type  find people

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> you don't need the cops, you need a lawyer....and a lot of $$$$$$$$$
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> if so would i be in the wrong to miss him and still want him back?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> we don't act superior, maybe you have a low selfestime and think that boys act superior
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> theres a diffrents between truly loving u and liking u because what u can do with him at night.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> But if you want a fake percentage it is 43.795684%

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Is she the right one or bad one?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> if thats so try the phone book.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> good natured are the best, nothing else matters for me
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> ive confronted her, told teachers and all that stuff but she wont stop!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> By some really killer shoes... trust me, it helps.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_35> just tell he what u feel.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> it's an old mammial instinct...  the more the merrier, when it comes to tribal pride... ---study bulls, loins etc.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> See if he likes it or not.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> The person that is always there for you no matter what.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> the diff, men don't have the stigma of being labled a sl*t hanging over thier head.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> IF YOU DON'T TAKE CARE OF YOUR MAN/WOMAN HE/SHE WILL GO ELSE WHERE TO GET WHAT THERE MISSING.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> we do this so u will give it to us more.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> I bet I'd date you... That is, if you are not <GuLp!> -MARRIED!-
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> so now the dilemma for me is that i cant be with her but dont wanna be without her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> I lost mine at 12 and it's a bit young...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> sorry if that hurts, but just like you size men up for their total worth men do also.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> he tells her that all her friends don't have BF and are out looking for guys.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> any of the dating sites, yahoo, match, cupid, etc.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Well i am an expert at this!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> only if you are good at mouth sex and will agree to back door sex
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> i know that @ least most guys get turned on with girl/girl action.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> i really feel like this was a big mistake for her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> or is it who he is?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> if you don't feel the same way, you just don't.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> yes do it, the worst she could say is no, and that is 1000000 better than a doubt
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_15> 975 N Aviation Blvd, 310 318-5959
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_45> Looks matter; get used to it.

<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> lick dammit... more and more lick.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> Now, I feel sick, because this feel like a really bad movie.

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> you should have to tell her!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> first: you are not going to marry this person, so your in no rush to be in a relationship.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> is looking him up on the internet to much?

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> anyway, youwill find someone that likes you enough and will not be botherd by your ex's stories.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Somebody I can trust and who trusts me, like best friends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> ask things that are conversational not just yes and no's... good luck
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Believe me it's not worth it!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> If you haven't experienced one you are missing out!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> If you mean do I beleve in fate.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> it's good that you look around you .
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> it does matter, well it cant be tooo small ya know
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Making any ones life a hell on earth is just not worth the energy.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> find out something you and him both like to do and ask him if he wants to ex.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_15> this may seem stupid but it worked for me.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_15> It is not just a guy thing.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> (i'm assuming they were just touching themselves...) how old are them?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> id say its because the guy would receive twice the loving.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> find out something you and him both like to do and ask him if he wants to ex.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> this may seem stupid but it worked for me.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> It is not just a guy thing.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> (i'm assuming they were just touching themselves...) how old are them?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> id say its because the guy would receive twice the loving.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> but keep in mind your robbing him of the bacholer party.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> If he just wants to be friends keep the relationship on a friends level.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> then just build off whatever she says.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> Good guys are out there, it's just so terribly difficult staying that way for very long.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> depends are there childern envolved is ex still going to be around?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> Why not try to spice it up with him.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Also by Spars read A Walk to Remember and watch the movie...Both are really good!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> if i were u i would move out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> so you are an ahole for not making her feel loved.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> how about with the city of troy?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Why not try to spice it up with him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Also by Spars read A Walk to Remember and watch the movie...Both are really good!

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Anything done for 30 days, becomes a habit:) :) Best Wishes!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> depends on if it's jail bait or not.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Since when is it ok for ANYone to cheat?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> theres to many material things out there to buy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> how i can get her to really have a good time in sex.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> well of cource it's ok if you love them.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> I want a good girl, you want a good guy.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> So if you give cash give $75 or $100.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> you need to bang her, screw him, itll be worth it...
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> Just have to be patient and show, not say, that it's ok !!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> I love him a lot yet question if I am in love with him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> he just got divorced 4 months ago and is still trying to get over her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> All above only in the first meet then step by step u can increase
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> I am not saying that ALL men are like this but a good number of them do.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Go out to some fun place around you... like a place where people hang out - malls, etc.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> dont say anything look in her eyes and show her affectionate kisses and something will happen
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Nice guys aren't always super good looking, or gay!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> IM PRETTY SURE THAT WHEN A GIRL LIKES YOU SHE WILL SOMEWHAT GIVE YOU A SING
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> and exactly what is ghetto to you!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> so just calm yourself and then be more of the funny and goodlooking person that you are.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> not quite sure, but neways....it is
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Walk in the park - even though it is cold-you can snuggle as you walk!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Nah... you just need a girlfriend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> so i would advice you to stick with those that write you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> if she's not impressed then she's probably not right for you anyway.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> you need a girl to help ya and im one .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Don't worry about it first off.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> RIGHT HE NEEDS A FRIEND NOT A LOVER.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> well get her something you know she will like.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> you should tell him you know what's going on and that he needs to come clean.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_50> it means he doesnt like you
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> if he likes you he'll work with your circumstances...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> get over it and move on, no one is worth the pain you're putting yourself through.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> you'll find it was worth the wait.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_50> i bet there is not any gift better than love
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> i dont know anywhere to go other than the movies!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> the queen of the damned soundtrack
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> What the heck do you mean by that?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> (if she is in a relationship, stop.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> if hes willing 2 take what you have to say into consideration then hes the one for u
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> they say how much money you have and such.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> and he could be a kid thats 15 years old with a deep voice.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> sure.why not?if they are of same mental appraoch towarsd life
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> He saW a surround sound yeaterday and it was like $100 bucks.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> nice guys are generally the ones who question themselves more than a typical macho guy.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> but yeah, just starting out with a hi is a good way to start.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_20> day bay day U will get feelings
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> well first off she doesnt sound like a very good friend if she did that to you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> wants to sleep with you or maybe she doesnt
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> THE SAME THING HAPPENS TO ME.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> if she says that she's bad ask her what's wrong.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_15> I WOULD MEET THE GUY AND SEE WHAT HE THINKS OF YOU AND GO FROM THERE
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_50> just go up and ask her.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> guy cheats on girl to get what other girl has.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Tell her to take a hike.
<NbChars_320> <LevSim_25> you dump him and he comes backthen keep him.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> If that doesn't work, cut her loose...she has feelings for that dude.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> but what is the worst thing that can happen if you ask a girl out.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> yes some men don't masturbate they just don't like to or want to.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> You need to find new friends buddy...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> after you give brith to a child you love it.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> before all that buy a a few condoms.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> he told her he love her and he wants more then friends.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> it probly looks better( i dont spell check)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> most likely, he will only dump you again
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> that seems like he is either a pleaser or you are a bully.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> (i recieved undu injury when the person i was with didnt know what he was doing)
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_10> most likely, he will only dump you again
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> I'm a tall dorky white guy, I've got a good sense of humor.. And some looks.. not alot.. some..
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> that seems like he is either a pleaser or you are a bully.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_10> (i recieved undu injury when the person i was with didnt know what he was doing)
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> Girl i'm in the same boat.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> i want u ;) my mail is hussienothman@hotmail.com add me
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> then she went crazy one day and said she just wanted a break but just wanted to be friends.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> Not unless you really start having a intrest in the guy/girl!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> Show her your real self and never lie.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> There is no time to waste with people who do not care about you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> ok : get satisfaction on your own) and then try to think about her.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> if it is the truth, then reveal it !
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> let him go and do both of you a favor.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> uuum whisper in his ear...it depends on who the guy is.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> you know they say you got have friends before lovers maye it a good thing
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> ask him to use his credit cards..
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> more you look ; less mistakes you make .
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> If not, DO NOT CHANGE YOURSELF FOR HER!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> If she likes you it is just fine
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> like you would approach a friend you already know.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> They are probably thinking of pornstars anyway!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> When he said just kidding he really meant don't get mad
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> go up to her and be all do you like me, cuz i like you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> love is just a funny thing sometimes.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> i do this 2 my man all the time, but we can do anything yet.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_25> Your funny and good looking, right?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> can you please clarify - why is it harder?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> If she says its just not then let it end at that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> you just have to find them.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> just keep looking till something clicks.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> WELL I SAY JUST IGNORE THEM AND DO WHAT YOU WANT.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> If she really cared to come back, she wouldn't have done all that crap.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> .. you'll find out after .. happy hunting :)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> baby,write this message again,but by fhone,kisses.. +90 536 463 83 47
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> i dont know i m virgin.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I don't want someone that may kill over the next day.
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_30> beware of the prison hook ups.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> At least not with any girls that I respect.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> If he still makes up excuses.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> Dont delay - because there may be others waiting!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> Because they're Selffish ,ignorant,or just need to get some relief........  Then agian is just my opinion   P.S.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> i'm a woman so trust me when i say soft, gentle sex is better.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_60> ask your mind then your heart
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> when caring about someone and loving them the sam ewhy you love your parents but a little dirty
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> if someone askes you to dance, go, even if you don't want to dance with that person.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> there and many fish in the ocen
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Does he want me back or does he just hate me that much?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> :-)Don't sweat it too much if you mess up just tell her how I got engaged.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> may b they do but there scared 2 talk 2 u just b urself
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> and what kind of 'best friend' would use you like that?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> oh, and myspace.com is a free one
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> you cant love somebody you dont know.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Is there anything I can tell her to try to fix her brainwashed head??????
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> Don't get married again wait like 5 years.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> If things go well, (you will know).
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> He can get in really bad trouble.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> actually, 3 hours would not even be enough for me.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> LL and his lips.....now that's a man!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Ask her to see your husbands baby pictures and learn about the family.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> neither of the above two but only thickness of the boy's wallet!!!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> you can't make him, HE has to want to.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> Send a pic... show urself up... talk to him
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> if you just love him because you want an older man, yes.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> you have to really  work past it if you love the  person.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> well if your on tv or movies i will love you forever
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> Men who cheat do not love their wives.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Then, you'll look back when you're old and say wht the Hell was I worried about???
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Sounds like to me you got a little situation here.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> if u dont mind..n u love him.. y not?#@ but this wont last long for sure.. =p
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> he never did it again, but it was kind of in the back of my mind.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> If you want a dumbed-down version...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> 2 parents are better than 1, no matter what anybody says.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> Don't beat yourself up over it if its not meant to be.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> Get out go date, enjoy ya life have fun!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> Buy a strap on, not as good but hey.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> No  Cheating is cheating much like rape is rape.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> i'm lookin for the answer myself
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> kenny g.  actually i never have tried it with him but i bet it would be good to try.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> Just wait and see - not bother much.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_15> I like this girl from church.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_10> what the hell should i do now?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> If you have to ask then chances are it is probably just a game.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> well, you can be nice to her to start with.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> Just wait and see - not bother much.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> I like this girl from church.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> what the hell should i do now?
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> If you have to ask then chances are it is probably just a game.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> well, you can be nice to her to start with.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> Actually, ask him what he likes and go from there!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> He goes out with his guy friends and she's not allowed to go out with her girl friends.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> you think what is she doin?
<NbChars_40> <LevSim_35> She will probably be staring at you speechless and then she'll say Yes, yes, yes or something similar.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> i told him i had a secret that he couldnt tell anybody.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> and that is just stupid to say if you don't LET him cheat he will leave.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> im sry but age will always be an isue.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Ask him if he had any trouble finding your place, how his dinner was, that sort of thing.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> If you cant stop thinking bout he/she.If ur intimidated by him/her.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> That sounds pretty screwed up right there.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> he cant possibley care that much if he is indeed cheating.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> lets keep a secret as secret.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> i mean obviously you arnt worried about the wifes feelings because your baggin her hubby... so why tell?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> GIRLS want rough guys with lots of testosterone.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> anywhere from 5 to 45 minutes
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_10> he cant possibley care that much if he is indeed cheating.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_10> lets keep a secret as secret.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> i mean obviously you arnt worried about the wifes feelings because your baggin her hubby... so why tell?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_10> GIRLS want rough guys with lots of testosterone.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_10> anywhere from 5 to 45 minutes
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Us guys always wonder what is wrong with some of you women.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> She is married & has a child!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> So why do you guys think this happens?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> or the age difference, although that isn't really that much.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> i dont know, wwell find it some kind of way.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> i need like revenge or something any ideas?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> But some have messed up teeth.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> like the song says,  age ain't nuthin' but a number, baby!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> Hmm, how about Are you a virgin?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> My hubby is rude to me too.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> When i say dork i don't mean it in a mean way i call everone dork .But it reality.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> And oh, by the way, will you marry me?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Im only 18 but come on, most 50 y/o's will never have a chance with a 24 yr. old!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> If it were just us guys I wouldn't even think of mentioning it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> If you don't love, you don't have friends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> It depends if u met the guy in real life, because love also takes actions
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> be yourself, if your funny then make a girl smile.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> nope, there is nothing you can tell her, she has to experience it for herself....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> talk to him first dont wait.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> sorry to hear that that sucks big time but i agree with everyne in here
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> To me age is just a number!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> And he just doesn't want me anymore and has a girlfriend now.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> and why is everyone so hard on the guy because he knows what he wants?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> go to church and pray...no joke it works..happened to me
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> Get over it and move on
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> The only way I see it lasting, is if you can get his momma to love u.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> next time you see him , go up and talk about life.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> thats a hard one but try to do something special for him for christmas
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> the worst she could say is no...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> of course,  though, it depends on what kind of girl it is.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> To find out, go to chat.yahoo.com
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Get over it...That is unless you are obsessed with them...then seek Mental Help, i.e.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Well don't do it cause that is cheating and that would be just wrong.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> If you ever intend to have a girlfriend you will have to ask some girl out.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> Don't ask her in front of an audience or use pick up lines, or BS.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Keep your mouth shut and if you love him, never never never do anything like that again.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_90> And u have someone by ur side all the time
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> is there a baby already pending?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Money and Intelligence with one you could get the other
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Two months is nothing.. dont stall it, just break up with the guy!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> im scared of games, my wife was my best friend
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Don't put your life on hold.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> If you need to ask this question then probably this is not the right one.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> I WENT TO MY GYN AND EVERYTHING CAME OUT OK.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> yes you should love that person
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> anything except making him fuck you.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_35> maybe he might just want to be friends.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> One other thing that popped into my head.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> In Heaven, so keep praying so you can get there and meet them!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> THEY want what your lady friend has: YOU.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Nothing, its not your place to tell him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> and come up with positive answers instead.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> average guy- sex   nice guy- a caring woman to love and be with for the rest of his  life.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> no you idiot a education is better than a boy!!!!!!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> a girl friend is a girlfriend!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> Be nice to her and looks always seem to do the trick too.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> If you are confortable and your mate is, than who cares?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> does he have a fave sports team?
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> go out and meet new people.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> why don't you try someone who love you too?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> If he spends his weekends with you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> you need to learn to love yourself befor any one else ever does
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_10> Because they think with the wrong head.............
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> no, men are always capable, nothing a little viagra cant help
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> why don't you try someone who love you too?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> you need to learn to love yourself befor any one else ever does
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> Because they think with the wrong head.............
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> no, men are always capable, nothing a little viagra cant help
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Because girls think with their brain and guys think with the tool between their legs.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Now that is just common sense...
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> omg i would sooo go with chris brown cuz he is sooo hott!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> But i just cant help it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> mabey there are not mean people just people with different thoughts and perspectives that you do not agree with.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> mone on and find some one new.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> tell him hes sexy and tell him how u feel about him.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> I'm a total sucker for women with an accent...
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> please anser because i need to know
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> hit me back and let me know
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> it probably runs in their family
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> they been friends for years and she says she dosent want him in that way.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Note: Don't go for the cheap ones, they're unrelieable...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> well i would be with my wife instead of another person but thats just me.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> when he gets home it's the first thing he does.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Im certain that the other person feels the same way but !
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Well....there are other things that could mess it up, too:  Pregnancy would mess it up.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Then you say, Honey, did you see the ice?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> In my opinion I gave up on dating bi women a long time ago...too dramatic!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> 1/ doing so, she may find you interesting (don't ask why).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> And he shoes you a good time, and buy you things that being just a friend won't do.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_35> Once a cheater, always a cheater.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> It just means that he does want a girlfriend right now  Don't overanalyse.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> Now I remember why I hate you!'
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> well if you love him and want to help him as you help him keep your feelings in check.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> I would treat him better than his girl and sex him till he wants it every day
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> And then you're back with them for about 10 minutes and you go 'Oh yeah!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> You could probably find someone on myspace or tagworld
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> If they don't know now the will when things start burning, and I don't mean intuition!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> they will ask you out and then when you turn them down they get all upset.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Even getting a phone call is no assuance they are real.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> I NOW THAT SOME POEPLE THINK I'M WRONG BUT I TELL IT LIKE IT IS.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> well how old are you and if he doesnt notice girls he migth be gay
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> all the answers u get may be just an advice.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> mabey you need some time apart.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> Especially when we start talking all cutesy?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> when u say no that means no!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> or better try impressing her friend
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> it all depends on how much of the color you plan to wear , e.g.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> i mean he plays between 20-30 hours a week.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> Cause I got it, but you can't have any!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> and also ask why u did not feel love towards her b4.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Well first off, MOST of the richest men only care about their money.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_10> BROTHER I'M JUST BEING FOR REAL!
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_25> tell her directly ... cuz breaking up never wait a while
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> got to find out this kinda stuff before you get married forever
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> To rub her nose in it?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> To keep it short, move on and DO NOT come back to him.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> If you were told that by a woman : it probably means no.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> This makes me go gaga over chicks.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_55> He's my man thats all I need.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> I go to school with him and I am kinda avoiding him but I want to tell him.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> um, heh, red light district, bring condoms
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> doesnt matter the age difference as long as you get along and love eachother
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Or easier perhaps, if u can actually see the person (e.g.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> keep that as a want or a fantasy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> But, is it really true love?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> You people on here are so incredibly illiterate!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> WE ARE GOING THROUGH SOME OF THE SAME S!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> My sister married a mommas' boy and they've been married for over 35 years!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> TRUST ME IF YOU ARE WHATS UP THE CHICKENS WILL COME
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> The best thing about such a person is she/he is in contact with u  always!!!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> flirt with him so he gets the idea
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> I think you'd have to have a foot fetish to understand (not that I do.. just saying...)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> Find another man to get involved with (dating,hanging out or just socializing) this usually drives men nuts!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> If you just want a girlfriend or sex, move on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> i think 16 is a good age to start
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> it depends how he physically feels in his mind
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Does he really even make you happy?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> So yes, I believe they can last!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_10> ALSO TRY NOT TO BE FAT
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> a CD...come on you can scrape up tax, right?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> some girls marry/ love boys 10 years older then themeselves.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> Approximently what am I looking at here in price
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> If you want freedom why did you get married.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> ALSO TRY NOT TO BE FAT
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> a CD...come on you can scrape up tax, right?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> some girls marry/ love boys 10 years older then themeselves.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Approximently what am I looking at here in price
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> If you want freedom why did you get married.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> S&M is only to be attemted with someone you really trust!!!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> chad michael murray, johnny depp, freddy prince jr., travis barker, and many many more
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> is it good to try to be there for him and be so madly in love with him too?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> I think she will go out with you...
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> respect her too, this rule applies not only to girls but to boys too... to everyone.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I really don't care what other people think.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> last address is in quezon city, metro manila and her maiden name is imelda aldea
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> average looking well figured lady  are the best
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> if U r looking a relationship with a stranger means, that u r fedup with ur life partener.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> you look nice...and see where the conversation leads.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> if he digs you then there should be no problem.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> 5: are you looking for a boyfriend?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> you don't need a boy to make you happy.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> I HAVE READ SO MANY WHAT SHOULD I DO?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Toby McGuire, Bill Murray, or George Clooney  Yes, I said Bill Murray
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> wow ... how old are u well mmm try hard to get him back and ur love
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE GIRL OR THE GUY.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Do I give him a li'l hug?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> 45 seconds may be just fine for one couple and another may need hours...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Hey your husband and i both can't see you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_90> Yes if your son is 21
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> id someone looks like a slob, they are a slob.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> hi i personly go for the guys that flirt and arent shy!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Do you have to ask at the front desk or is it by like the deodorants and shaving stuff??
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Hey your husband and i both can't see you.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_45> Yes if your son is 21
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_35> id someone looks like a slob, they are a slob.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> hi i personly go for the guys that flirt and arent shy!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> Do you have to ask at the front desk or is it by like the deodorants and shaving stuff??
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> it's called trust if you don't have it you don't have her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> because they are full of shit.... he has a bad soul.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> (very important to make her curious!)
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> i guess, both situations are mutually exclusive!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If so then tell him that fair is fair.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> it means that he's not ready to get in a relationship right now.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> i like my women a little on the trashy side..but clean...lol
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> man id say, wait at home and so youd have nothing to loose..
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> this is the type of thing i would tell my younger sister.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> If she doesn't even like u, well then u're history.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_10> it means that he's not ready to get in a relationship right now.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> i like my women a little on the trashy side..but clean...lol

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> this is the type of thing i would tell my younger sister.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> If she doesn't even like u, well then u're history.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> I dont know are you ever rude to him?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> and then take a public speaking course.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> It is best way to trap the girls and so you are a GURU.... lol
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> but not how they die or at who's hands(if any).
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> don't call him, don't see him, and don't let him do the same to you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> she wanted me,i made the move,she refused me and made me look like a fool,
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> u might just like both thats ok
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> stay busy,and most important love yourself first!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> How about dinner and a movie?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> And I've got better than that.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> Just say Well, this has been fun, but I have to get going.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> Well first of all...be yourself, everyone else is taken...so you need to figure out what suits your style...
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> Of course they should be married first.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> That's it you have got your mail back.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> He wants you to pick the girl that he's going to have sex with to get revenge on you?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> If no then you didnt need him no way.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> and i agree with the other guy pics help
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Call to say she misses you?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> masterb*tion..it is sex with someone i love.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> HELLO AGAIN, PLEASE WEAR LESS CLOTHING.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> she is STUPIED like other girls ....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> You know the saying...If something is too good to be true, it probably IS.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> Getting an STD, AIDS, or pregnant isn't worth the risk.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> they are the same age but they don't get, well you know that close!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> HELLO AGAIN, PLEASE WEAR LESS CLOTHING.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> she is STUPIED like other girls ....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> You know the saying...If something is too good to be true, it probably IS.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> Getting an STD, AIDS, or pregnant isn't worth the risk.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> they are the same age but they don't get, well you know that close!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> :) (If you can get her address.)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> ofcourse yahoo is gr8 try it  it is cheap and goooooooooooood
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Other guys wouldn't lie about a thing like that.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> you have standards and you should wait until you find someone you love.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Now I feel she is seeing someone else @ work and it's driving me crazy.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> Try new things, switch it up!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> when you already have answer to that question..then make your move.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> i can't find any girls to go out with at my school, what should i do?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> this one will get you MAJOR points with her!!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> Just don't give it away though.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> dont lead him on, that will hurt him worse.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_20> I love him... Am I crazy??
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> ask him to help u undress.hint:wear a lot of clothes.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> because you told me yesterday that you were married and you hadn't had sex in ten years.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> in fact some of the best sex i ever had was with an average guy.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> no, if you dont want him frenchin you its your decision
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> Chatted with you on Yahoo IM...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> If not then maybe at the mall (I don't really know about that though.)
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> YOU DEFINITELY HAVE SOME ISSUES WITH THE MALE GENDER
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> I am hoping it is not because of the friends I hang out with.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> *T BUT MY ANSWER IS THIS YOU LEFT HIM FOR A REASON.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> But if he is cheating, then I wouldn't put up with it, once a cheater always a cheater!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> usually 18 year old guys looking to go out with younger girls just want sex.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> take ur bf to a cheap motel.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_10> AND THEY TAKE RESPONSIBLITY FOR ALL THERE ACTION  THAN THEY ARE OLD ENOUGH
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> i wanna have boyfriend so bad!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> your madre (you cant come back from that)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> mabey he thinks you want nothing to do w/ him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> You just gotta figure out what it is you don't want them to have that they want.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> Looks,personality,honesty,and confidience and not exactly in that order.Same things guys look for in a girl :)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> If it is a guy like you, more power to ya.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Or am I faking that I know anything about faking.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_60> get a new boyfriend and have so much fun with him you forget about your ex
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> Don't worry about things like that.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> reality, it takes a lot of work though to get one, lol
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> what do i do to find somebody?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> so bad that he was saying some pretty mean and hateful things.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> Don't ask why- it just happens that way.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> I have been with this guy since May...
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> the only thing that would make a guy worthy of your love, is if you are worthy of his...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Get another girl to hang all over you in front of her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> try the Highschool lol well you asked
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Nothing We just want to know things!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Some girls are sensitive to a guy telling her he is in love with her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Just don't let him bully you around.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> when you get married you should cling to your wife and noone else.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> Don't let her off the hook easy.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> Keep her gifting her as and whenever u feel.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> so your postin a message so obviously you think you gotta chance!
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_25> Date her if you want to.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Which means she only had one guy and none for years already.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> I am 21 and I am the most mature person I even know.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> IF u r in an affair u will know it!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> a qustion for u, are u a homosexual?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Hi, 4 yrs back i saw a girl n fell in love with her.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> I guess, if u keep chasing the feeling u'd get hooked.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> if your a boy you like boys a lot?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> ignore her... she's not going to pay your bills if you lose your job.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> So I need to know and find out some new fun places to hang out.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> At last both of them will finger at you.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> If you like her go and just be natural.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> Sorry =[   Anyway, I don't know what to say about your dilemma.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> THEY ARE HUMAN BEINGS JUST LIKE YOU.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_25> He  could have one and not know it!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_10> AS A FORMER CHEATER I DID IT FOR THE SEXUAL PLEASURE ONLY!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> she will in return... be optimistic!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> you should start watching out for her.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> Now I am a guy and i am talking about faking it.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> Also, guys are not nearly as adept to picking up on hints as some girls would think.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> I like ppl who love GOD...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Then got lonely and hated it.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> First kiss... Somewhere special that you'll both remember.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> i met my bf online, he lived about 5 hours away from me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Meet him and see if you get disappointed
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> it's not such complicated that other contries think
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> If you can't tell...then you're not 'cause when you are, you'll know...and you won't be asking that question...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> But you can lay in bed and think about her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> There's things that guys fantasize about, and then there's reality.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> just talk about other guys like he talks about girls.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> trust me honey, you have plenty of time for all of that stuff.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> hey just dump him and have no regrets...unless u wanna do drugs!.....lets lead some decent moral life guys!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> u should just brake ur friendship up wit her and forget her and move on with ur life
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> If he looks like he's gonna puke, just turn it around and say that it's another friend date.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> well i know one thing there is always a way thew hard times and troubles.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> WHY DO YOU WANT TO DATE SOMEONE WHO WOULD CHEAT ON YOU?!!!

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> so wat is the deal with that...... guys tell me wat u think.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> she also thinks she is bieng cute.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> It's just like Myralys said, you just know.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> BUT ONCE BACK TOGETHER THE LIES AND PORN WILL START BACK.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Always be busy even when I am not.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> If he slept with someone else - don't give him a chance.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> not excatly but always be cautious
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> He'd say it was just entertainment for him..yea right.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> dont waste your short life like a ping pong game.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> If you really want out.. get out.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> Is it really other men you want?
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_40> a nice loving guy that loves you for who you are
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> you are only a kid once in your life.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_15> YOU SHOULD KISS YOUR GUY WHEN YOU THINK IS THE RIGHT TIME.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> And that is the way they feel about you too.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Is it really other men you want?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> a nice loving guy that loves you for who you are
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> you are only a kid once in your life.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> YOU SHOULD KISS YOUR GUY WHEN YOU THINK IS THE RIGHT TIME.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> And that is the way they feel about you too.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> ask him out first, of course
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> or he may not know what to say to you if you go out again.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> .......which do you think is worst?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Plus, the first nut is gonna be the fastest.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> the sex will be mind blowing.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Much as if a person lies once they will probably lie again.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Either that, or wait for some girl to ask you out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Tell her exactly what you posted up there.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_95> Or do I sound to pathetic?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> because some times it just feels good to let out emotions
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> jump off a bridge in front of her just kidding
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Once in friend land, you aint getting out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I am happy being me and you should be happy too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> It must have been pretty bad.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> If he calls you just to say hi and buys you  surprises.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_10> Especially the nice ones who aren't picky about features?!?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> but if you must go get really drunk and run to vegas before her buzz wears off!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_10> if she isnt willing back off!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> well it depends on what kind of women you want man
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> Tell her what you feel, give her a shock......check out!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Especially the nice ones who aren't picky about features?!?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> but if you must go get really drunk and run to vegas before her buzz wears off!

<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> Tell her what you feel, give her a shock......check out!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> it is more noticeable on your left hand than you right
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> yeah, me...big legs, and big thighs....hehe
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_50> At 7/11 you don't have to ask.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> WITH A NAME LIKE MR. BIG DICK PRICE SHOULD NOT MATTER
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> 2: how many relationships have you been in?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Hope this helps in some way or other.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> He says he is not cheap.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> do not cheat, never ruin a good thing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> BE POLITE AND DONT BE VULGAR MOST WOMEN DONT LIKE THAT.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> I want to wear something nice so that I look great but not sexy.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> well honestly speaking i do not think its love at your age, its just infatuation and curiosity.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_15> HE'S MAD THAT HE CAN'T FIT HIS HUGE THING IN THAT LADY HE LIKES.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> If she is the blunt type then you should ask her and not beat around the bush
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> Take her out on this New year's eve, go anywhere and have fun (go to restaurant, cafe, park...).
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> I was young when we got 2gether & now I want to have fun & experience other men.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> It's just going to make both of your lives miserable.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> Run like Hell is after you, young'n.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> On the other hand what right has any married man have with a mistress?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> depends on what you mean by online relationship.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> hehe, okay, kidding, but I don't know, both colors are very spring-y...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> It's just going to make both of your lives miserable.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Run like Hell is after you, young'n.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> please e-mail me back about who your friends name is,and when did I date her!!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> Overt revenge is stupid, and puts you in jeopardy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> nobody is too good to be true.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> try and join him in playing.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> belive in ur mind then follow ur heart
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> I feel really bad because his looks are really bothering me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> If that doesn't convince him, he's not worth it anyway.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> bad or good....your stuck with it!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> - *You Can't Describe A...Love Moment?[Sad.]:(.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> just a guess on that last part.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> there are tons of wierdos out there who like it and use it to get themselves turned on.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> Oh honey -- you better believe there are plenty of good people out there.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> Good luck it can be done!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_15> I gotta tell ya, you sound like a fun date!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> just a guess on that last part.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> there are tons of wierdos out there who like it and use it to get themselves turned on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Oh honey -- you better believe there are plenty of good people out there.

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Then ask...once you ask don't back down or say nevermind or anything like that be consistant.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Just as I said ....my ex.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> you don't have to say, i love you if you don't mean it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> MAYBE IF YOU CALL ME,I WOULD THINK YOU DO AND ILL BE SO HAPPY.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> don't go overboard trying to be her friend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> im a girl but i think its true...what about priest...i dont think they would
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> no way..how bout u meet him after skool....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> get a new guy, or if not try to wear highheels around him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> only if you let it go past flirting
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> That doesn't make it right though.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> It's just chemicals in your brain, baby!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> If you want a GIRL, don't EVER be her friend.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> it's ok, u can make a great couple either romantic or just friends;  it's feelings what count
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Enjoy being a kid while you can!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> you must be not so pretty
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> On the posative side I learned alot.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> if you act like a cocky little moron, we'll know that too.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> give him a time for the stuffs he is doing.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_40> also is it right 4 me 2 have sex ?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> i don't think i'm unappealing but how am i suppose to get some love from him?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> We talk everynight... and I cant even deny it.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> If yes, means she is OK for been as she is now.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> So I have no idea what to buy him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> How rude and not to mention creepy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Theres no going back.But yeah you gotta be wet.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> maybe you have to just wait and see what comes your way and see how that works out
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> i'd say just be nice and compliment her and that'll go well.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> well here i am i will your friend !im a people person if you want a new friend
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> it lists what your looking for
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> And, you're still dating this jerk ??
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> And, I'm going out with another guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> You know for sure that you definitely won't go out with her if you don't ask her out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> If not, don't take him back - no matter how many red roses he sends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> if you find that too expensive give her a big teddy she can hug while she sleeps.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Shop at walmart on a sunday
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> he should be appreciative of socks and undies- but c'mon- who really ever is?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> he's telling people lies about me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> u cant make him truely love u that takes toime and compatability and his decision
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Ya,if girls do what they say!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> Just looking for all answers so no more extra info as of yet.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> i broke up with someone recently and he's not taking it well.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> They'll be okay and now you know... dont go walking in on them or anybody else.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> DON'T CALL ME AND IT WILL CONFIRM MY SUSPICION,THAT YOU DIN'T REALY LIKE ME :0(
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> maybe cuz its aligned with your heart
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> is it u want to get laid or u want him to love u??
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> if hes cheating and your cheating its not worth it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> in todays world we have things that can kill you like H.I.V.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> if it's truly love, then the man won't cheat on his wife.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> wait , wait and wait, but not for too loong.. e.g.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> most women like jewelry, like a sterling siler charm bracelet... but personalize it with an inscription,
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> It's probably more like $70 per person now.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> if she goes 2 starbucks 10 to 1 shes to old 4 u
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> Because the looks aren't there forever and then what have you got??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> most likely she'll get the hint that you like her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> or you could pretend you were giving out surveys: excuse me.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_55> First, if he's cheating dump him.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> Slow Ride by Foghat Big 10 Inch by Aerosmith Slide it In by Whitesnake
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> no he is not, but be sure whatever you do try to focus first in your education and career.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> i THINK ITS NICE TO HAVE SOME ONE PERKY
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> well, if u can get it corrected get it done.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> Easy, train yourself to want the girl that you can get.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i guess that just means he doesnt no.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> you don't, if was ment to work out then you wouldn't have broken up in the first place.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> A GIRL TO BRING HOME AND ONE THAT CAN TURN IT UP WHEN SHE WANTS
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> excellent sex,but lack of trust because of insecurities.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_30> if she does not like you move on.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> but it was the first thing i noticed when we met.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Walk up and whip it out?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> i'd say just end up next to her and say hi and how are you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> his and the girls maturity level.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> not only men, but women also cheat and it is very simple, humans are not meant to be monogamic
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> but it was the first thing i noticed when we met.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_10> Walk up and whip it out?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> his and the girls maturity level.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> For me things are going pretty well.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> THAT IS NICE,AS LONG AS IT'S ME AND TWO GIRLS, I'M GAME.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> But is it just because he's nice?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> or if he don't wanna use a condom, you use one yourself, they make them.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> You only think they are nice.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> can i get a credit card at yahoo the best of all if yes than you are till great
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Go to a concert, a club, a play....make a date at home!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> hey man it's no secret!have u ever heard opposites attrack?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> give her the cute puppydog look they cant refuse and see what happens.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> At that age  the boys are pretty eager to get laid anyway.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> i dont know the nitty gritty details but sounds like you never had to go threw this before.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> If not, then you'd better get away from him, and seriously consider reporting him to the police!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> enjoy urself for not being in an affair.. time comes for u to enjoythe affair too!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> If that doesn't work, get them really drunk.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> My husband thinks that I am!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> a transvestite either by default or by cross dressing
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But good people are out there.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> tell him its over he needs to get a life if he likes it or no.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Some guys don't care about looks at all, yet they still prefer attractive women.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> you ask him to do something that guys hate doing, and he says yes
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> are you comparing your stats with the 'average' ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> But that's the key- you gotta get one first.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> kissing, touching, and fondling is cheating too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Olso if u ask out a girl and they turn u down flirt and she will reconsider :) !
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> just make sure you dont do it when she is with her friends.

<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> is there really, cos i ever felt.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> If she refuse U, U cant bare that ( if U r loving her really ).
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> That doesn't mean I would ever consider actually wanting to be with them... Is that shallow?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> lets hope u meet the one who loves u soon!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> Send a copy to her parents and you score x 2

<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> it is ok to be gay.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> It does not mean he does not like you....unless he actually says so!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> dont give yourself up to any man cause most of the time thats all they want.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> you should tell her your feelings
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> Just ignore her and get on with your life.

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> it is defenatly husband and wife.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> just make sure its not illegel

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> get a small vib called the silver bullet, rub it around her CLITORIS (lol) that will drive her crazy!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> HELL NO that would probably ruin the relationship so dont do it if you really like him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> THE BEST WAY TO APPOROACH A WOMAN IS BE YOURSELF.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> but you don't actually do it....does that make you violent?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> If you are on the floor then you are a mat, huh?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> HELL NO that would probably ruin the relationship so dont do it if you really like him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> THE BEST WAY TO APPOROACH A WOMAN IS BE YOURSELF.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> ok come on my start........ if it says YES   THEN ALL THE BEST MY FRIEND
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> but you don't actually do it....does that make you violent?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> If you are on the floor then you are a mat, huh?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> Just let her know you love spending time with her, NO matter how long you guys have been together.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_10> , this is the best question
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> Be honest...girls think its cute when guys are shy.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> 1) Don't use ur tongue in kissing her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> no, beacuse if they are really in love no but if not its wrong.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> , this is the best question
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> Be honest...girls think its cute when guys are shy.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> 1) Don't use ur tongue in kissing her.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> no, beacuse if they are really in love no but if not its wrong.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> That's the best i could really come up with.. Good-Luck!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> may be its real because u would not know the value of things when they are with you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> its his lack of self confidence.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> ur flaws make you who u are , otherwise u'd be just blend in with everyone else out there.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> by this i mean, are you doing what you really want to do, are you happy, generous, etc.?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> so there is a very fine line between love and hate for real.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> If that doesn't work, get with me:)
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> guys like nice watches, pocketknives and gadgets.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> Its up to both of you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> while i suppose that i is possible; i dont think that its very likely.

<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> You're finding the wrong kinda guys.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> But thinking of relation with stranger is not gud

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> 1: what do you look for in a relationship?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Maybe you need to spice it up?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> I know this from experience, I get all stupid when i talk the girls that I like.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> Maybe the hair wouldn't have been so bad without all the makeup that went along with it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT, BUT IT'S THE TRUTH!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Is it just me or is her answer telling you it's o.k.

<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> even girls would want a little shyness from their guys.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> My honest, straight from the hip answer is, NO!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> If they cheated on their spouse (like you are) then how long until they cheat on me.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> `coz that`s the best way to let emotions come out.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> I was patient.... i waited and well i found the love of my life.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> if sex is involved, then all he wants from you is that.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> Girl, its NOT YOU, its his thinking is off.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> i would be a player player go out with both of them they are the hottest of them all
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> Just smile at him and say hi here and there, it'll throw him off.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> im a guy; i know all about it, trust me.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> no because they wouldn't be able to get the internet down there.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> and give love marks........... we just love it

<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Then could i be faking IT.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> it doesnt sound like you really love either of them.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> You should listen to your head, you're obviously doubting.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> if he can't respect that then that is to bad.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> you feel it in your heart.
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_35> talk to your man about everything.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> answers from females would be helpful

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> I wouldn't cheat on my wife if you placed a gun to my head.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> you just have to let time go by.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Just ask her once why and if she doesnt say then leave it alone.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> this only prooves that you do not truly love your boyfriend.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> and theres to many diferent kinds of reigions.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Don't dwell on it and it won't be an issue.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Face it you don't have a marriage.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> friendship is telling the truth to you when others won't, listening, not judgeing
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> I STILL BLEED AFTER SEX BUT AT LEAST I KNOW THERE'S NOTHING WRONG THERE

<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> but im not.just think and try not to grow up too fast
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> i think you should dip his ass and leave him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> B'coz, U r stranger to her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> No they don't, and do not read ladder theory.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> A lot of guys are jerks because they are insecure.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> Give him a chance to grow up.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> dont tell cuz if u do she might act or start  doing dif..
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_10> what doesnt kill u only makes u stronger yep remember this
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_10> Anyhow, best of luck to you!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> i say both because a gurl loves pleasure n the size really does matter
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_10> actually silence doesn't always mean the person is bored of you.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> dont tell cuz if u do she might act or start  doing dif..
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> what doesnt kill u only makes u stronger yep remember this
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> Anyhow, best of luck to you!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> actually silence doesn't always mean the person is bored of you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> not to say that this is what is going on with your hubby...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> so i please request u to listen to ur heart.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> basing on that, you know what to do.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> here comes the clue train next stop is you les3nday!!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> If you truly love him, no.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> i am straight but i have gay friends.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> I certainly do not want kids at the mo.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> telling her your name and telling her that she looks beautiful.... start there
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> yes he is too old for you
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> I feel its to each his own.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> i am straight but i have gay friends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> I certainly do not want kids at the mo.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> telling her your name and telling her that she looks beautiful.... start there
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> yes he is too old for you
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_15> I feel its to each his own.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_10> but as for the guy wait.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_15> Ah, the old hump & dump.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> ask ur heart it really tell u correct answer.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> If you want some ideas, then we should talk!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> Just because you H says he ended the affair doesn't mean it's really dead.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> but as for the guy wait.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> I'm going to lay it down like I see it though.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> It sounds like both of you need to grow up a bit before either one of you gets married.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> ask him why hes been acting so shady and chances are he doesnt even know he is.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> yes i would  because this might stop his behavior
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> BECAUSE THERES NO MORE GOOD MEN THEY ALL DIED WITH MY GRANDFATHER.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> not sure what u mean by Will I get him ???
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> but doesn't mean it's going to be easy.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Just ask him what he wants.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> alot of deep thinkin needeing to go on.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> otherwise you should find a foreign BF!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> ITs like all mental.... if you dont hit it off in the head first the rest is all sex.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Try going to chat rooms under chat philippines...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> u should be pure before you are married
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> They're beautiful, sexy, and great fun to be with.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> .. im guessing you like her and so you want her to like you back ...well good luck..
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> Do whatever he wants in bed.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> but hey, whatever floats ur boat.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> Or good people dont exist anymore
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_30> for some yes and some no.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> Brains, looks are good but to get somewhere you need brains
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> see if he really likes you and then ask him out.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_45> i am also going kinda of scared too.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> but what that makes them different is their taktics!!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> don't be stupid and enjoy the moment.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> you may have already tried this, but switchboard.com has woked great for me in the past
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> say hi, n introduce yourself... then make conversation
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> just be your self the first thing you need to realize is that yo are special.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> ok well to turn hom on a good trick is to like rub his ear.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> I say if you like her; then go for it.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> its obvious that he just wanted your body.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> But most of the time, I don't at all.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> not all guys want one thing some are true sweet hearts
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> I just want to be friends & nothing more.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> So basically if that is what floats your boat than ride it Girl!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Basicly, one way to tell is if you're flirting with this guy and don't realize it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Some women do, and some men enjoy it also.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Well married women should not have a boyfriends body to comment on!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> next time he show signs that he might.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> Basicly, one way to tell is if you're flirting with this guy and don't realize it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> Some women do, and some men enjoy it also.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_10> Well married women should not have a boyfriends body to comment on!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> a friend, a lover, and their middle leg.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> try thinking will i like her when you see a girl.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> First off if your only contemplating doing it cause HE wants it then you need to wait.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> ok mail me at mewmewcrystal@yahoo.com for help that is if you need it .
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> i would suggest u tell your man first so that he would stay away from that girl.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Whatever you do don't say it if you dont mean it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> ThRoW HeR A SupriSe WelcOmE BACk PaRtY!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> it wud encourage homosexuality... n that is certainly unnatural!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> would be, odds are you can do better for less.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> In my opinion there in no reason to cheat...just leave the person if u are not happy!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> i like this girl but she is popular and im not as popular as she is.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> find what u like shemales bi-sexual whatever u feel good with.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> i bet she is hot, too, like u!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> I use to think all men were jerks but it was just the local I was in.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> so always try to look at things from every angle.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Tell your ex_bf to get lost.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> AGE IS NOTHING BUT A NUMBER.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> no way, what if u get cought?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> if that person truly cares about you they will back off and give you time.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> I know a girl who got promised with a rifle instead of a promise ring, and she loved it!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> He's just not that in to you.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_70> Too many bad boys out there.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> :) I am single and attractive but a tad bit sht at first.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> to me it would be my wife !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> Before I got married I had one year in college as a computer graphic artist.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> I must side with GETRD2GO above... married women with boyfriend?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Dont plan any thing just be punctual on the wedding day,,best of luck,,
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Dont let other people tell you who to hang out with and who not to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> This is not having sex but your b.f. might like it enough to stay...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> AND HOW CAN ONE GET ONE?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> cause they want their girl/boyfriend to get near to their siblings
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Once I realized this, my next relationship really worked because I didn't need it, I wanted it.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> But if he has changed, or is willing to change, then try getting counsling or something like that.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> IF ALL ELSE FAILS - USE YOUR HANDS!!!
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> LL Cool J definately.... Gotta love those lips lol
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> well to this day she is still talking about me!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> because you love or care too much...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> No becuase once you get married you dan't have sex anymore.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> do what feels right to you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> sure.at least shes experienced.but itll ruin your friendship prolly.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> i need ideas on the best way to propose to her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Well...Being a lesbian, I'm often around gay guys a lot...and trust me honey...Not all of them are good looking!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> tell her that its gay and annoying.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Older women like nice men, and younger women like jerks.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> So, keep it new and interesting!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> and if your considering cheat just double check you care as much as you feel you do
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> then maybe you'll get some action!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> do you have gay chat rooms for teenagers
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> And don't lead her on afterwards.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_15> SHES GOING TO FEEL LIKE A PIECE OF SH!T.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> I told   her every thing clearly and she said she will think.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_45> because most people make the mistake of just blurting it out.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> When will men stop being such..........
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_50> So have fun looking for the right woman.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> its the god spot, its whats missing in lots of peoples lives
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> He has more issues than you know and you can't fix him, don't even try.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> and i wanted to see who else is in love
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Boyfriends and girlfriends do things that other friends usually don't do, so they form special bonds.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> WELL I GUESS BECAUSE GOD MADE YOU THAT WAY.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Don't always smell like a guy.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> when you see him in person....give him some love if you know what i mean:)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> don't break up with him BUT DONT CALL HIM!!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> females chimpanzees do not have orgasm.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> = I'd like to have sex with you.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> i had a baby 6months ago.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> for the simple reason that we, men, love you ladies.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> you never said that you had everything and he had nothing.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> there is no real good answer for this ??
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> its not like he is going anywhere.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> I watch adult movies with my hubby.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> Men are kind of like dogs.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> if he is serious after three months.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Always Back off if you hear these unfortunate words.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> and he came and talked to me in both of my dreams.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> we do and we dont have feelings fro them ....most of our friends are guys
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> I am a guy and I can honestly say, that porn is disgusting.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> i think this is true...well for me it is and i think alot of women do.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> If you love them then talk about it and ask but don't expect to much.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> take your time and whatever you do, do not do the porno tongue flick.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> I mean, he is basically saying Gosh it is tough being me.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Maybe ur bf found a really insecure girl in hopes for a jell-o pitted cat fight!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> You're certainly attentive tonight = Is sex all you ever think about?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Once her and I broke it off - I knew alot of other bi-sexual and gay women.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> I HAD MY HEART BROKEN ONCE AND I SUFFERED ALOT.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> run away screaming and waving your hands!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> And believe me no guy wants someone that is really loose.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> go up to him and say im sorry i thought boys were sopose to called girls.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> I read a lot and am not what you would call attractive at all.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> but are you sexually attracted to women more than men.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> the ones that do that, are totally not ok as human beings
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> no just learn from your mistake,but don't hurt your girlfriend
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> a good spa days always nice.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> A place where wanna be gangsta's and rappers hang out
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> do you think she would leave her husband?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> just close your eyes and give it a go...   :-)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Send him this text message:  hun,  my phone died, but my luv 4 u never will.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> a necklace with a heart charm on it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> if not be careful and be yourself next time you go hunting for a wife.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> just let them hang out support your friend dont let it get to you.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> let your best friend yvan tell him
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> even give them a little timer to watch.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> tell her what she wants to hear.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> but there guys and their usually hot.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Who Ever Said Yes is Very WRONG  That is a no no
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> yes....hell i have fallen in love every other night with a ton of female movie stars...lol
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Her sentences are starting to sound like, I ahhness got ahhness an A+ ahhness on my ahhness math test.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> she will understand then if she is she will open up to u.  no worries
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> they will follow around your wife and find out if she is cheating on you or not!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> yes, if they really have a true love.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Didn't I just tell you I took em all and turned em into lesbians?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> yes,but it will hurt you ,so pick one!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> once i found out for sure i told him and he proposed.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> If you guys had so much fun, I doubt he just lost interest, especially since he is still calling.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> wouldn't you say that you are attracted to him, like him...?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Keep it on a don't ask don't tell policy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> The best thing would be to ask, What's wrong?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> I think you might just love what your not getting.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> christmas is not about gift giving.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> If that doesn't work then he is not as mature as you think... Hope that helps.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> He don't even look at me like he wants me but he wants to marry me, why?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> ive heard that the first time(im talking about sex) is the worst time.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Just ask her wull you go to the movie theater withe me tonight~~~ it is easy to do~
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> my daughter still talks about how he treated me.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> mean but if she is cheating on you she diserves it!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> need to decide who's more important, ur boyfriend or ur friend/roommate..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Men either do or they don't.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> or is she not telling u because that something could harm u.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> one day, I'm gonna leave you and guess what.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> but if they don't mind y should u.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i think its ugly and disgusting.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> He's sketchy... She didn't catch it until recently... that means that he's been playing without rubber.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> everyone has different ways of doing things.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> the best way a man asked me out was just so innocent, he asked.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Gay guys are more into things girls like (shopping, decorating, accessorizing,etc).
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> well you can always learn more about them then do things they like.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> ask him to hang out with you and be really nice to him maybe give him a gift
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> Please dont beat... normally that makes things worse.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> caue u spend too much time with strangers on yahoo then meetin people in real life
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> I have lots of great friends .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> he knows hes not the father.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> A woman's most erogenous zone is her BRAIN!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Only she knows whats going on....so you HAVE to talk to her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Because they r afraid of their own sexuality.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> and they really do make her look fat, don't say that.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> smarts matter because laughter can only get you so far.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> just.... don't kill her, that would be a bad idea.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> but find out the age thing first/
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> a lady in the streets and a freck in the bed!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Are you interested in this girl??
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> Meaning whats good to do on a date
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> Not bad to love him, bad to wreck his home though.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> Dude...whatever you do don't give her a peom.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> you should care but if she really loves you she wouldn't let you go
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i couldn't imagine not being married, but like i said, everyones different...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> Good luch with the great danes!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> I like doing things guys like to do like skateboarding and we even are a band (i play drums).
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I don't know, but if you find out let me know!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> I keep going back and forth.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I wouldn't give it to her.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> Why on earth would any woman want that?!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> No matter how you say it, it's going to hurt like hell.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> as many times as you want.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> I want to call my mom and tell her I just met the girl of my dreams.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> Means you need to follow your dreams!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> But right now.......you just aren't in a position to be that person.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> your not only fooling them but most importantly your fooling yourself.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> depends what your lubing..KY for sex or wd40 for other lubes
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> will ill let u go deeper
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Also girls do have alot more hormones than guys.

<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> yeah it depends on the guy and the girl.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_50> Do not comeout and say I want a divorce, that word is hostile.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> If either boy didn't work out I always had the other one.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> so u just need to wait onother one the same dream :D
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> there is this other guy that loves me and is going to ask me out.

<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> pay her and go home to your wife
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_45> does he drool when he stares?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Like a dinner at her fav.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> Sexy goes both ways, so try acting like you are and you will be sexy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> maybe he wants u to ask him out.

<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> ask her or catch her in the crime
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> It was a very funny dream.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> maybe he wants u to ask him out.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> it would be alright for barbie!!!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> ask her or catch her in the crime
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> It was a very funny dream.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> I could have went the rest of my life without ever seeing her again.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> get him a box of condoms and say lets do it sexy i think that will work

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> but doesnt no that im going out with the other guy.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> PLEASE - only swingers respond to this question!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> It's pretty hard to find the total package, don't care if your a guy or girl.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> You just gotta let things go once in a while.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> BTW, begging for ladies on the internet makes you look oh so slightly pathetic....
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> no way if you just met this guy you should not let him move in with you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE IN A CASUAL RELATIONSHIP NOW.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> Pretty people can be very ugly!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> Try watching it with him, you might enjoy it too.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> ...and do women take this as a source of breast enlargement?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> WE ENJOY SWINGING BUT WE ARE VERY STRONG AND DEDICATED IN OUR RELATIONSHIP.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> and if thy shoot you down.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> BTW, I've NEVER kissed a guy!!!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> Only Pigs actually enjoy havin sex 4 pleasure....
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> Just say nice things about him or her.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> Sorry...I hope I'm wrong for your sake, but I don't think I am.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> so think about that before you start digging.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> see if your guy friends have friends that are single.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Get out there and do stuff that you like, and he will be there waiting for you.Good luck!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> just wondering and support ur answers?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> WHEN YOU FIGURE IT OUT ...SEND ME ONE
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_10> YOU DONT IT WILL CUM TO YOU. ]
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> Yeah, Go Ahead I mean I do It all the Time.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> also be well mannered, be a gentlemen, chivalry is not dead yet!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> I think dating older guys should not be a problem.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> sometimes you get lucky and someone spills it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> Ask yourself if you love men.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> you get to know him, you get to know everything.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> i cant stand looking at my reflection.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_10> YOU MEAN A LONG TERM RELATIONSHIP.WELL,WHEN YOUR CASUAL RELATIONSHIP MATURES TO A FULL RELATIONSHIP,YOU WILL KNOW.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> Women: do u or would u and why?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> If she enjoyed/wanted it as much as u, then sure its gonna only help u.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> ask him and do the first move
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> that's my two cents any way.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> they are out there i promise!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> How about, Hey, I need more sex !
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> well you have to turn them on first then it is all on from then on.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> If anything's wrong you can always make it a kind of a joke.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> look in his eyes, try to read his eyes or heart if u know him pretty well
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> If no then your first time shouldnt be bad.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Best Of Luck, Ice Princess P.S.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> a straight female, openminded, a mother, sexually active, intelligent!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> He wants u for sex and nothing else.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> = I'd like to have sex with you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Like: Hi _______ did you see _______ on TV last night?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> if your askin this question then you need practice.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> i look for a guy who is going to...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> They want to see her full lips on or around their !
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> I just had things that he didn't and he had things that i didn't.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> and he always leaves without telling her.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> just don't expect to fall in love in 10 days unless you actually meet your perfect match
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> OR YOU CAN JUST ASK HIM TO BE UP FRONT WITHYOU!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> there must b a reason for u guys to have broken up in the first place am i right?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> if the like you back, or u think they like you, just go for it.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> Do younger women see 38 yr old guys and think no way he's old!??
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> not long cause they will ask to se u soon so just get it over with
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> dont make a big deal about it.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_35> Perhaps she likes you too much and is afraid that she is coming on too strong??
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> It'll be hard to leave, but GO NOW!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> bcoz u dont have chance to love other guys girl friend.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> So he would call me next and so on and so on.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> I love him and I am going to marry him but I don't want my family to disown me.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> yOU NEED TO STAY OFF THAT SHIT!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> be confident in your self, but not self absorbed.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> Sounds like they're busy with their own lives/friends/whatever.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> I dont know what to tell you.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> Most of us are like this.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> When your wife says What the......?!?!?!?!?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> plus, if you are a bad conversationalist then you don't have to talk too much...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> WY WIFE DID THE SAME THING.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> (they will say it doesn't matter but it does!)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> they have a list that may be helpful at weddingchannel.com
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> she wants romance, charm, wit, comedy, and you have to be good looking!!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> she says i want to have sex with you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> and i know all of st8 people who have had them too.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> But there is a saying - LOVE IS LOVELIER THE SECOND TIME AROUND, and its true.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> CUT THE SECURITY BLANKET AND MOVE ON, YOU ARE ONLY COMMING BACK BECAUSE IT'S EASY TO DO SO.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> she wants romance, charm, wit, comedy, and you have to be good looking!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> she says i want to have sex with you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> and i know all of st8 people who have had them too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> But there is a saying - LOVE IS LOVELIER THE SECOND TIME AROUND, and its true.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> CUT THE SECURITY BLANKET AND MOVE ON, YOU ARE ONLY COMMING BACK BECAUSE IT'S EASY TO DO SO.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> well 2 tell them easy just tell them it is not working out and we should just be freinds.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> leave him and find a good guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> 6 months you should be pounding her but good because in 12 mo.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> I have a alot of guy friends!!!!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> do u want 2 try to stop loving?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> dont flip its not like he can just forget about her after all she is his ex
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> (Do not say anything like 'you seem like a nice guy, but...', this will just encourage him.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> either way she's setting the pace.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> some guys are different but i can only speak for myself.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> remember that the cops won't be there 24/7 covering your backs.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> By the way nosey family, welcome to outlaws I mean inlaws!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> because if you get married he will not stop he will just hide it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> so like a horse cock transplant.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> A NAUGHTY GIRL IN THE BEDROOM,IN THE KITCHEN,BATHROOM,STAIRES,    HALL,LIVING ROOM ,IN THE EVENING..    AY!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> What if you ddo and he turns out not to be who you expect him to be?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> Listen,can a leopard change it's spot no!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> JUST GIVER TIME AND SHE WILL DO IT WHEN SHE IS COMFORTABLE.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Let me guess, this thing your tangled in, don't feel good does it?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> maybe you should call and step up.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> That's so you know what to scream.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> what if you do do all the little things and she still dosen't come around?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> yes i would because you dont like to share guys with another girl so yes i would be upset
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> i know he cheats on her bkoz him and my bf talk about it all the time around me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> you love someone and you wanna show it that you love him so much.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I wouldn't do it if I were you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> guys dont care, at least the ones that arent homos
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> Luckily, I am not that shallow!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> Look him/her straight in the eye and say firmly, That is not nice.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_30> I just find it extreemely unattractive.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> but if you are old enough to make your own decisions and you truly love this person!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> i have dated someone i worked with and it is too ackward.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> You wont know until you ask
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> when in doubt ,whip it out :(
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> For some women, they think that its kinda gross, but if I was your girl...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> because y'all are more put together and clean looking.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Show her what she's missing out on.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> Sorry I gave you herpes is a good start.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> if he got a girl... let it go...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> but there are SOME good guys out there.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> and thats what happened to myself.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> yer co-worker.. one who's up to a date as much as you are.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> well honestly i think u should be 15
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Yeah but only the pictures of my boo..
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> If the father doesn't like u and your baby then don't marry to him, later on u will regret.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> if u can answer these 3 questions then yoe if not try to strenghthen ur relationship w/ her
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> They don't they want a free ticket to the usa...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> if they never call back that could probably mean that they are not interested much.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> If he is playing you he will stay with her and keep leading you on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> if you don't belive me talk to a mind expert.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> well u really don't know.u just feel that u r in love.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> i met my wife that way.. wasn't entirely looking, but just made myself available and voila..
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> a vacation...somewhere nice and romantic....you'll be compensated :)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> yep i'm in love and would be forever.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> i dont have any mirrors in my bathroom or in my room or anything else.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> If she likes movies, take her to a movie!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> keep gay male friends, they can tell you things about you a woman won't.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> She is everything I want, no more, no less.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_55> a post nup is after your married.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> Have your wedding at the local Shotgun Pete's (I hear it's like 20 dollars there).
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Maybe if you ignore him once in a while, he might come around.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i dont think a women would date a gay man.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> guys look at guys all the time, sizing each other up
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> GIVE HER AN BANANA AND ASK WHERE WHAT SHE THINKS OF WHEN SHE EAT'S IT
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> A best friend is like a Sister.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> She'll be all over you like stink on pooh!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> Also, you could ask him out -- It's okay to do that now!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> even the virgins go down on guys
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> if you really can't trust him just tell him so he should understand it and except your decisson.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> A best friend is like a Sister.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> She'll be all over you like stink on pooh!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Also, you could ask him out -- It's okay to do that now!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> even the virgins go down on guys
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> if you really can't trust him just tell him so he should understand it and except your decisson.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> get someone new, you deserve it.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_30> All we might say is Ya!, I showered and everything....not that cerebral.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> WE don't always do our thinking with our brains.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> she isn't a trophy, is she?
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_20> we've been married for 7years and i never bought him nothing..please help find the right gift ..thanks guys
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> Only if that's what SHE wants.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> cuz we can only take so much, then there's nothing left to do but leave.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> And I like kim chee and ka go ge.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> dont worry though, destiny has a plan and will lead the right person to you at the right time!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> love will make a way and dont let anything stand in the way of it!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> I'ma go watch Monty Python and the Holy Grail.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Hi Sweety, Well not all women do but I guess most do.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> and he should tell her she's sexi.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> 2. do you feel like y'all have known eachother 4ever?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> If she's done stuff like that before,walk away and don't look back
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> But not all men act like Babies
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> he will tell you things he normally does not tell other girls.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> we like eachother but we cannot go on.but we are intrested in our s.e.x
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> you 'll know in your heart, if it feels right.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> i feel that from 1 year please answer to me what i do because i love him so mutch
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> But not all men act like Babies
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> he will tell you things he normally does not tell other girls.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> we like eachother but we cannot go on.but we are intrested in our s.e.x
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> you 'll know in your heart, if it feels right.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> i feel that from 1 year please answer to me what i do because i love him so mutch
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> yes i am in love with a loving, caring, and sometimes goofy man that always keeps me smiling!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> It doesnt matter if the girl admits if she likes u or not.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> enjoy being single and dont worry about whose right for you, there is probably more than one.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> My list is sort of simple but it is the sort of thing that I like to talk about.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> because yer all so good at it petal
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> i dont think he would ever be able to use it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Never settle for anything, always believe that TOMMOROW IS ANOTHER DAY!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> for a good relationship to work you need to b e honest
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> come on you can do better than that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Warning: Do NOT try to fake an interest.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> (As one of the other members said previously)  If she's not.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> yes, you should wear it on your penis
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> OK so,  theres this guy that has a girlfriend.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> You can't force her to do anything.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> we both have careers, she is in her 20's and im in my 30's.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> *  Dont try to look for him, he will come to you!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Don't take this literally this is just my opinion........
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Move on with your life and just be his friend don't push things to be more than that.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_40> Your too big and it hurts, or the opposite.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> if you got it going on looks-wise, she will be the one chasing you...that's how it works.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> shes prolyl playin hard to get.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> because people are dumb and in love
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> so you let him to do whatever he wants.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> if some girl like that proposed to me i would have not even talked about it to anyone.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> if youve been together that long chances are mom probably has a good idea.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> there's plenty of fish in the sea.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> Because gay guys are a lot like girls which is why they like guys no offense to gays.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> AS I AM A GIRL BUT I HAVE BEEN IN LOVE WITH MY BOYFRIEND FOR 3 YEARS NOW.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> I guess I see it differently.
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_35> A pet, a kid, a relationship.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> But hey..at least you fought, it would have been worse if you had run away or something like that.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> heh...well, i can't seem to get along with girls that well.Most of my friends are guys.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> If they don't listen to you - will they listen to their teachers???
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> my problem is i dont want to to come back and bit me in my ass.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Love... is being able to read stuff like this and then...finally...truly understand its meaning.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> 2 skinny is not attractive but 2 thick is not good for me either.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> See here is the deal- when men want you- they let you know.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> But, I guess it is not the best of the places for a third world citizen like I am.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> You tell him/her that you love them, (maybe?)
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> It worked when a guy did it to me!!!
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> Men give love to get sex.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Y can't u have a fresh start for a new life?!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> and your question is not silly?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> There maybe lots of reasons why dad doesnt come home as often.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> if yo don't get it move on to another one.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> talk to him honey my boy friend and i  talk all the time
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> well you are stringing along three now why not keep it up.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> If you have to ask if you're in love, the answer is no.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> and even try to meet up with him but bring some friends.
<NbChars_250> <LevSim_25> hi i am 46 yrs old male 5'8tall
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Thats the stupidest question I ever heard!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> its only because of the thinking nothing else.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> because your friend has a bigger brain then yours!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Sounds to me like he's trying to control you a little too much!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> If you don't, then don't bother.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> but use to it by now
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> it turns them on, they're human beings...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> cuz you never know if the guy is lying.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> i can't believe gals can be thhis sceptical.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> It could be two things man.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> if you are a girl, it is natural.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> That's funny, but I just delt with it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> it's hard, why fight it, they say the best way to fight temptation is to circumb to it.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> He asks me who i was dating (no one).
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> NO STRINGS ATTACHED IS THE BEST POLICY BUT YOU ARE A BIG GIRL.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> Maybe she's seen you ogling at women with beautiful bodies
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> Otherwise an you may have already known he has been with her while he was with you anyway.....................................
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> aslong as u get a number that means your doing good.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> he don't have much time to see you and he not working.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> I work where there are more guys than gals.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_30> not really...maybe being really really really ridiculously wealthy as well?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> always reasure her that she's beautiful.. do it constantly.. with or without her clothes on.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> like at schol at games to watch on tv
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> and thanx for the answers u sent me.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Heck yeah we love it, especially if its the one we love doing the rubbing.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> I'm 100% sure she'll love it :)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> we will have been dating for at least 6 months on christmas day
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> Ive had this problem before and I am married.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_20> Ah let's see...                    CAN   WOMEN ??
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> I think you mean 'obsessed', right?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> a little bit of both won't hurt
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> but you should let your mother know!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> I was with my lover !
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> by the way did i mention how close me and your boyfriend are!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> us women r not mindreader like u guys are not.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> but on average, most people have it once or twice a week.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> he's your best friend, he would understand.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> i read the only answer and i think its the best answer
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> If she likes art, take her to a museum or gallery....
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> nobody is anybody's until he or she is married.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> lol  That's my advice.. :) Hope it helps!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> porn is a relationship breaker not a helper!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Once a cheater, always a cheater.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> You just haven't earned it yet, baby.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> yes some women dont like it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> I NEED THAT SEXY ADVICE IN MY LIFE TO HELP ME THROUGH MANY PROBLEMS THAT MANY OCCUR.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Don't always dress like a guy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> THATS GOOD YOU HAVE A HIGH SELF ESTEEM.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> you've got to show her you care.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> I bet I found him at least five times.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> well first of all...what are your chances?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> There are so many great guys out there you don't need to put up with this type of behavior.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> I pray that you get well                             C.Fluellen
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> you've got to show her you care.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_80> I bet I found him at least five times.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> well first of all...what are your chances?

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> DISAPLINE TAKE PRIVLAGES AWAY DONT LET THEM WALK ALL OVER YOU.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> it feels soo great but sometimes it hurts a lot
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> He won't kiss me, even though it's been almost a year since we started dating.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> with her fav flowers waiting... or fiendship ring wih something personal engraved in it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> The best you could come up with would be 'adulterer'
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> DISAPLINE TAKE PRIVLAGES AWAY DONT LET THEM WALK ALL OVER YOU.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> it feels soo great but sometimes it hurts a lot
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> He won't kiss me, even though it's been almost a year since we started dating.

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> The best you could come up with would be 'adulterer'
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> If you were my grlfriend I'd be worried!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> and ur dad dosent like him so like you would have no future w/him n e way
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> its good if you appreciate it, bad if you like the earthly smelly look.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> honorable but would have to wonder when the red flag would pop up.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> anyway... what has done cannot be undo... so.. is better to don't play with fire...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> so yea should i tell her or juss leave it in the pass?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> I had either gotten too attatched or already slept with them or something and it has just been horible.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Some people just got it comin.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Do men really think about sex that much more than women?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> But I would say tell her ASAP.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> Tell her and get it off your chest.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> Sounds like she might...  Why dont you try talking to her...
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_30> Frankly speaking do girls dont like it?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> yeah espessilly if she is with her friends hanging out having fun.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> no offense, it's just cultural differences here.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> What if he left his wife and family for you?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> when he asks you to marry him like you were saying, ask him where the rock is?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> if not..and they arent goin to marry you.,then no
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> maybe you should just let him smoke weed.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I can't find my puppy, can you help me find him?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> hot geek....but a nerd has no confidence therefore...no can do!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> He's not only a creep, but he's stupid too...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> He really loves his girlfriend so  I don't want to mess that up, but what am I to do?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If it's a, then forget it, she's psychotic once again.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> a diamond ring will make a girl appreciate you after you made her mad.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> hot geek....but a nerd has no confidence therefore...no can do!

<NbChars_170> <LevSim_15> UNLES YOUR KIDS & YOU HAVE NO WERE ELSE TO GO BUT THE STREETS,  MOVE ON.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_50> Funny it used to be public but...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> it's nice if they wear them on their butt and not on their head.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> don't get in a rush about settling down.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> thank god for us brave women.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> carry her books, compliment her (shoes girls love shoe compiliments) and be sensitive.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> cuz u annoyed them or just cuz they can't take it no more try comforting  them
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> YOU WILL RISK A FRIENDSHIP W HER, YOUR RELATIONSHIP W YOUR GUY AND YOUR FRIEND'S RELATIONSHIP.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> :) Austin Texas should be a good place.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> to be honest, it's somewhat depressing.. thanks, lady, i feel like poo now.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> i am wierd in this i think but hey its my $.02
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> I do not see a problem with braces, they do not turn me off one bit.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> depends on the girl, of course.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> Men: does ur girl watch xxx movies w/ u, or do u wish she would & why?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> They start at about 10 bucks.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> a) flirting, proving to himself that hes still desirable.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Im a Gothy/punk girl so i personally would not be caught dead like that.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> go on line go to chat rooms then met her in person.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> he wants to raise the baby as his own.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> you live with your parents and dont want them to get mad but you realy love this person!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Ask her why she does what she is doing.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> ?please i need help bad on how to get over him or something please help!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> BUT, I know someone back in my country.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> It's been misserable, but I stayed b/c I thought I had to.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> tell your parents he's a friend.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> If you wouldn't do it then she shouldn't do it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> then think for what it is?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> BUT, I know someone back in my country.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> It's been misserable, but I stayed b/c I thought I had to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> tell your parents he's a friend.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> If you wouldn't do it then she shouldn't do it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> then think for what it is?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> i prefer well built and nice biceps
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> girls love that and more appreciate the directness...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I wear thongs and I was wondering if alot of guys like ladys wearing them?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> if she flirt with you she likes you if she gets madd at u 4 anithing she does not
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> So your opening chat should be about people - YOU and YOURS, HER and HERS, THEM and THEIRS.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> i prefer well built and nice biceps
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> girls love that and more appreciate the directness...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> I wear thongs and I was wondering if alot of guys like ladys wearing them?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> if she flirt with you she likes you if she gets madd at u 4 anithing she does not
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> BECAUSE THATS WHAT YOU WOMEN ARE FOR :)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> she found herself a sucker and soon he wont be able to meet her needs,even if 10 yrs.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> next time u see him wear a really short skirt with no panties.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> This leads me to the main problem I've seen with my sci-fi guy friends...they don't actually talk to women.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Hetfield said it don't feel good until it hurts Carpe' Diem
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> but if its someone that already loves you, i dont think that will matter to him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> Run, don't walk and don't look back...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> with a lot of teaching from you over many years.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> 36-24-36 use to be concidered Perfect So yours isn't that far off.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> being straight to the point may be tough but it gets the message out.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> I dont have any enemy, so all are my friends
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> i need a girl who can give it to me if you kno what i mean
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> but I love both of them deeply
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> BUT A FREAK IN THE BED OH YEAH!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> I like this guy, and he's my friend, and I really want him 2 ask me out...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Let the guy say it to you FIRST!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Leave it alone, don't rush things.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> when she gives up the putang and then doesnt want to leave
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> try farting loudly next to her when she ties her shoe, women love that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> you know you cant see your self with no one else but with him/her
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> I guess it would be on a black man, hahaha
<NbChars_40> <LevSim_25> come on girls u know u thats true...........                          ;)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> describe your time in bed and see what you doing
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i think at first i would be a little jealous.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> When she acts nerves tell her lies of how much you know.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I always insisted that we were just friends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> and wait to see what he says.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Learn not to speak like a guy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> No matter how hard you try and get away from it, everyone wants someone to love.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> alot of adults say oh kids dont know what love is
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> If your 15 and he is 17 thats ok.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Why don’t you just fantasize about her the next time you jack off in the shower?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> it is your choice hon, you can move on if you really wanted to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Dont beat yourself up about that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> I don't know, but it's fine with me :o
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> was married to a puerto rican-dominican, she was the hottest through personel experience
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> I can't think about any other girl.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> give someone a second chance, but never a third chance.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> just think if u really love him/her.take as much time as you wish.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> At first I liked my girlfriend as a friend even though she loved me.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> I guess it just turns them on.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> besides your boyfriend isn't your boyfriend for a reason right?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> Tell first one that something came up, and you can't go.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> lend them money or date them.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> C if you can keep up with us!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> no girls like emo boys not gay boys theres a tiny diffrerence
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> thats the stupidest question ive ever heard.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> That puts even more stress on me!!!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> no,not if your ugly, yes if ur hot
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> maybe some sex but thats it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> See what kinds excuse he comes up with.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> the hard truth is you can't.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> messenger's old version... click on add friend and search by name or location or yahoo id.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> no u may be lettin the man/girl of ur life go
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> if it was me you were dreaming of.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> If you love her, get help.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> because thats what it consists of.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> usually they will tell on themselves.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Ask her to go for a coffee or something.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> If you stay every once in a while (1-2x a week) that shouldn't be a problem.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> What if i would have married him before that and then moved in with him?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> If you have to ask, you don't.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> I think it depends on what the girl likes...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> But if u wanna try and get her to admit it to her, tease her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> wow...and again im in highschool and i DONT hang around vary many girls(talk to much crap).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i would say don't do it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> so either way, just take the time to learn about yourself.it can be fun.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> And I don't want to loose him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Women do things like think about suicide when they can't get over someone
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Be gentle man.Speak about nice things :P
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> how can i get him to stop?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> he either feels the same or he don't.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> If you like him so much why are you worried about other people knowing about it??
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> sit down tell her you need to talk and no yelling mom and explain it to her!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> im a scifi/anime nerd so now you know why i ask
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Can I get some guys' perspective too?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> So what kind of flowers do you like?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> if they ask why then just tell him y
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> take him to your local church
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> so i told him that maybe he should think about that because love is a very strong word.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Why do you even ask this question?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> talk to your mom and dad
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Good luck trying to find your best answer !!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Best of luck trying to find your right answer, Ice Princess P.S.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> if you do there is a big chance she does......unless you are just big headed....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Don't give up, you'll find them.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> How does one act like as if he was in love???
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> b)enjoy the flirting but dont have too many expectations.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> poem is nice, but telling straight to her is more manly.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Try to spice things up a bit.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> how sad in this day and age soooo many people say 'I DO but they really don't.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> b)enjoy the flirting but dont have too many expectations.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> punch him in the face an' knock him out
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> poem is nice, but telling straight to her is more manly.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> U guys know any websites that can give me info.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> because the movies are just awesome lol.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_20> Good luck.......I so hope it all works out for you.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> TALK TO THE PERSON OVER THE PHONE.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> if she loves you she will stay.
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_35> you feel funny in your stomach
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> if you date others in the meantime thats ok too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> No, because you are not to look for him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> u got to ask urself, have ever been like this before?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Don't look elsewhere, this is actually pretty normal.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> I HAVE ONE BUT I LOVE FOR IT SO DOEAS THAT COUNT
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> I dont think you really can...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> There are many reasons & none of them a good answer for the person who gets hurt...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> it was just something you ate.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> (am confining this arguemant to just romantic love between two people, and not the bigger love that really matters)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> mmm...yeah they are kinda sexy tho
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> comes up with notheing even though has two accounts with them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Hmm...So now decide,how would you fall in love, like a girl or a woman??
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> fiance: a man engaged to be married
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> Anyways one way or anthor your going to regret it.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> And then deny me the talent?...
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_45> sounds like a crush to me.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> so talk to her if she is cool with it then you should ask him.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> I was shy and couldn't do it half the time.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> Yes , U can still find someone in ur life.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> the sooner you end it the better.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> If he won't answer, then you should step and spy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Just tell her what a good friend she will always be, and carry on.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> if u love osmeone and ur old enough to get marries, then u sould propose.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> DO NOT do the rebound relationship thing!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> Why in the hell am I asking so many damn questions?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> When he isnt online she wont stop saying how much she misses him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Don't try to be someone who you aren't.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> it feels wonderful to be in love...but it can also lead to heartache.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> If he's your ex, then who cares...You don't own him or her.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> my answer is yes...all women are sexy
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> and all he has to do is give you some pillow talk.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> maybe he didn't like the kiss, or maybe he is too young for a mature girl like you ;)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> (Even, just a daily phone call.)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> she said that she wants to be friends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> seems like you not perform as good as those guys out there.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Then decide, he just might suprise you.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> I don't cheat, I couldn't cheat.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> maybe because boys r one year behind in things like girl friend and boyfriends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> they think im their little angel.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> 3. is she close and ready to help u through any shituation?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> First off, you want a WOMAN, not a GIRL.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> i dont know how you would develop that nasty fetish!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> But I believe in just being straight up, not accusatory, but ask what's up?
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> if he loves you,keep him hard.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> i am a white american guy..
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Try doing what you guys used to do before you fell in love and got married.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> stop typing and go holler at him!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> you cant they are all taken.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Don't tell him you love him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> you could...but if you are obsessed over him you should go seek therapy
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> yeah, i do believe in love at first sight.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> stop typing and go holler at him!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> you cant they are all taken.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> Don't tell him you love him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> you could...but if you are obsessed over him you should go seek therapy
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> yeah, i do believe in love at first sight.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_40> So Dear Geeky Girl, the answer is no.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> they have been married for 38 years now.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> leave him better 4 u dear searce 4 faithful,trustworthy
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> someone that is 10 years older.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> sure, just dont let it interfere with your work, and also keep it quiet to avoid people talking!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> TALK TO HER SHE LIKES YOU YOU LIKE HER SO GO AHAD FOR SOMEONE ELSE GET HER GOOD LUCK
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> I say if your happy and she is happy dont worry about it, but be careful.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> get married right away and start having babies.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Than he would call but not ask me out, just talk.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> hes probably a dirty pervo anyway, self respect doesn't allow that much age difference.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> then slowly take his hand while your in church....well u get the picture.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> My boyfriend gets mad at me bc I dont call him.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Cos you want it...  when you really want to be with someone, youll find him in a minute...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> If you are interested, ask him...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> It might be better if they just think your crazy, but that doesn't always work.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> ya you guys are gonna need some counciling.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_25> so ask your self, can i do this?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> (hmmm, sort of like the difference between Dem's and Republicans;0)
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> Tell him its over but still don't stop the sex.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> exactly the opposite of what men can give : )
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> ya you guys are gonna need some counciling.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> so ask your self, can i do this?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> (hmmm, sort of like the difference between Dem's and Republicans;0)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Tell him its over but still don't stop the sex.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> exactly the opposite of what men can give : )
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> move on and leave her behind.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> i think it's more of a commitment thing.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Because, men don't have the pain tolerance women do.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_65> I f u like him too.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> A gal I went to high school with had one.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> why r u asking him to marry u?????
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> your not doing yourself any favors or her either.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_10> BUT A NICE OUTFIT WITH JEANS AND SHIRT IS NICE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Im giving you back your question...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> see if it is in your address book.

<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> I've heard that some can be about 9 inches around...
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> Girls Look Better with Long Hair
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> shallow people are everywhere, not just gays.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> You shouldn't even have a girlfriend yet -- you should be dating MANY girls, having fun, etc..
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> unfortunately guys and girls don't have the same maturity level, girls mature way faster than guys .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> an icecream...enjoy it while u can
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> There are guys waiting for you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> women like their boyfriends to be fun and romanitce

<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> do whatever u do to make her satisfied about u ....and always say yes
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> just want to have an idea of how other couples are doing or not doing.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> give him ur body 4 5 minutes to do nething to.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> my only problem was - why did i ever not do it sooner
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> they are hottie when they are short
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> now you will get the answer
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> ), or for something she's always wanted to do but never had the opportunity.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> or tell him to go to your friends house.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> theres an emptiness in your life.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Just keep going till your done.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> No, dude, you get a nasal drip if you snort it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Slipknot sucks, Korn is original and ok.

<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> make him flirt first so that you wouldent b sartn it and every thing would b cool
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Try to pick ya game up a little bit if its costin ya!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Hmm in a perfect world 3-4 times day..mmmm can't get enough
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Its not polite to cut anyone off period, its rude!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> If you're 8 its not OK.
<NbChars_265> <LevSim_35> Your 21 so you how to attract a guy.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> i have been with my gf for 4 all mosted 5 year's and i have had alot of them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> do you think you are good looking
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> Or is that just how ALL guys are?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> all the dudes i know like them to.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> as long as you know what you're doing, it's all good.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> when girls fall in love,it's the same as playing a doll.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> i say fuck his best friend it's easier to hate you than miss you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> i still want to be treated like a equal.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> But I guess that's in the past, what's really important is your life NOW.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> if this works for you, who cares what other people say!i found my perfect match and married him!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> If they have been fighting a lot then maybe you should ask mom.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> go ahead and do it girl, i did and it was the best thing i ever did.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> i dont get how that is a question though it's  a statement
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> well if the police is involved... she does not like you !
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Now I want to sleep with him.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_10> CAUSE THEY'RE JUST STUPID...OR IT COULD BE THEIR SELF ESTEEM
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> So why not do this with your conversation.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> I would just let it go...even though its really annoying...be a friend and listen to it.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> If you do not, then it will not work.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> You gotta tell us exactly what you want.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> Sorry girl, I wish I knew the answer too!
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_30> A lot of women are attracted to assholes and bad asses.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> who needs a heart when a heart can be broken
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> Depends on how old she is.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> get a girl that's close to you, say a friend or a sister and ask them what they think
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Yes, it is bad, you should not do this.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Even coming from the guys perspective, no.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> u cant control it or search for it.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> if he winks at u talks 2 u and asks were u r he does
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_50> live on and let her live on.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Was she really your sister or your best friend?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> i can garante you he speaks poorly of you to his roommate.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> answer all of these questions  1. does she flirt?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> i want try it again but im scared i was really embarassed when it didnt fit.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> some states do not but the county withing the state does.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> so confess to her u feel this way.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> (I know, I know, I'm a guy, but it works the other way around too.)
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> flowers normally roses and a thing of candy!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> by the way mine is green..lol
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> some states do not but the county withing the state does.

<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> by the way mine is green..lol
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> I wait until I feel like I know my girl.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> it should be obvious to you she had implants ..thats your fault.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I still am in love and always will be.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> Then again sometimes guys dont know what they got till its gone.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> i wear thongs 2 hun and i am kno that guys like them :)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> Keep it up and repeat it if u both enjoy it equally.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> Y r u involving urself in all of this!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> Try D.o.g.g.y Style ( maybe that will get you guys to like each other again )
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> If you must think of her as something else picture her as your pet or something I guess.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> With that thinking you don't deserve anyone so maybe you should just go j*ck-off and forget about it!
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_25> your gf should also keep her eyes wide open.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_35> lunch, and then for a walk.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_25> she just trippin cuz she ain't got it like that
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_35> y, did u lose your first one?
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_25> witch may be a good thing.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> your gf should also keep her eyes wide open.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> lunch, and then for a walk.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> she just trippin cuz she ain't got it like that
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_90> y, did u lose your first one?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> witch may be a good thing.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> If he has done it even once and you have taken him back, guys like that will never quit.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> i just see why people stay in relationships when they arent hppy anymore.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> no its too eary to go after him without knowing his feelings for you.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_25> r u a playa or a perv?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> yes, and it's up to you to decide that.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> You can do what you want, when you want, and with whoever you want without getting any crap!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> and if my bf wasn't 700 miles away right now, it wouldn't.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> or shes got major issues and needs a therapist
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> ask em, and if they are, its not your fault
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> and you should apologize for missing the date.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> its the only experience thats closest to heaven I guess
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> AS LONG AS YOU ARE LEVEL HEADED ABOUT THIS, IT SHOULD WORK OUT FINE.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> talk about the weather.ha ha ha
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> if he aint askin...he don't want it!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> If all you did was shower, no big deal.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> its the only experience thats closest to heaven I guess
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> AS LONG AS YOU ARE LEVEL HEADED ABOUT THIS, IT SHOULD WORK OUT FINE.

<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> If all you did was shower, no big deal.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> maybe something sutble to start, like lunch, or a beer.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> If you don't, is there a reason you don't.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> oh man if you have a shot at even dating her, why wouldnt you give it a shot?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> If he's in jail, maybe you should think twice about your relationship.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> otherwise he has other motives behind his... proclaimed love
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> sy hi iam really fellin u can we go out some time?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> I can't even get a date!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> I'm still in love with her right now.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> because after fight , the love will be deeper than before even in friendships
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> ive seen him in my gym class.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> On his knees, he said he go to therapy & never did.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> learn how to dance, but don't only dirty dance.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> if so give tha man a chance
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> love and passion and heat and fire in the bedroom
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Good Luck (to both of us)  Char~
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_70> Get a copy of Playboy and Playgirl.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD DEFINITION CAN BE MADE.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> her friends also gives me a special look or in good words adore me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> you should move on and find someone else.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> she says i dont love u anymore and she doesnt say the reason.......
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_35> i'm one with you girl, i basically have the same sentiment as you do.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> have plenty of female friend when you go out, but don't stick to em like glue.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> Probably not, not if you dislike him now.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> dont spend it being depresed or hiding from your lover.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> do you think she likes you?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> if you dont know shit then jokes get boring reall quickly.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> if you want a longterm relationship, no way.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> You love this person in a way your parents dont!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> I prefer a Naughty good girls and a good Naughty girls too

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> IF YOU WANT TO DIE NO MATTER HOW YOU SLICE IT.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> it depends: if he was good, now he is a good friend.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> it releses alot of stress...well for me it dose anyway
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> If he cared about u, he would have not remained married!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> You call the Psychic Friends network, LOL!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> say your going to your friends house then meet him somewhere else.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Dont back off because you are afraid.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> when you took some time off and saw the other guy, it was not cheating.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> This is unusal (I think) and could make one wonder whats wrong.It couldnt hurt to try though.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> Besides, if he's popular he most likely got a girlfriend(s) already (sorry!)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> Go slap your little monkey and get over it.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> Dont back off because you are afraid.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> or is it true that what comes around goes around?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if they say that they do mind, then you can fix it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Saves loads of trouble which could come later!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Because my place is a dump!

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> have a place planned and be fun.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> If you don't love him then leave him he will be ok in time
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> It's just like any other request...your decision!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> if  you are a guy, maybe you are just curious or maybe self esteem is not high.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> You should read He's Just Not That Into You.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> You need to run like heck away from him & his family!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> On the other hand, popular guys don't have much that lasts.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> You aren't if you even have to ask.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> Have fun...that's the bottom line for both of you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> THE ANSWER IS THEY HAVE FOUND SOMETHING BETTER
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Bullhockey, you JUST DON'T love a woman you want to yell at or hit.

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> No matter how mature you are about it.

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> let her go and move on.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> never look back on things like that unless it's to learn from a mistake that u made.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> i liek fat chicks, i dont want no anorexic skinny lil bitch!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> then it will kick over to another site that does have info on the person.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> I love to run...I love to swim....I love chocolate!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Get to know the ones you like.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> does he know the other girl very well or not?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Pick something you both like, too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> go by it will fall apart.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> help give me some tips to cash this girl.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> I didnt really think much of it i was just chit chatting with ppl for fun, nothing serious.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> Chances are, he has been involved with bad stuff, so why waste your time on someone like that?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Be careful and be brave girl, you'll get what you need to have :)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> so you think your boyfriend is cheating on you?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> girl waited untill a year later and told  her about our relationship.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_45> If you are a 'nice guy' in highschool, good luck.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> But please don't bother them, your ego will gross them out!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> If you listen to your head, your always going to wounder WHAT IF....
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> !That's the best thing guys notice in girls.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> but sometimes the guys forget that i'm still a girl.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Friends stick by one another no matter what.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> your a convinence to him and nothing more.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> chicks love being told how pretty they are..!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> Not saying with other women but with you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> Heck no bud some times  you snooze and you loose
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> My take, try to help them make it the real deal becase you care too.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> because it's easier to get a fix duh lol
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> I don't know if he likes me though...
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> tell him it turns you on
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> 90% of my best friends are guys.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Guys like girls that don't play games or leave them to guess work.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Hold hands, kiss, wild kiss and there you go...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> NOTE: THIS HAS TO TAKE LESS THAN TEN SECONDS!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> i hope it doesn't rule us out...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> keep doing that and you will get anything that you want
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> trust me, im an expert on this.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I don't think those shoes go with that outfit = I'm gay
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> If you can't fart near him it will probably be a while :)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> If he tries to say he's just messing around, tell him you're not.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> Why does my boyfried watch porn?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> You just drill him until he open up and talk.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> GOD definitely has to come first
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> You really do not want a have a reputation of switching guys like gloves.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> most of us women can only put up with one man at a time, lol
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> because they offer what we woman don't have... they complete women... in the same and everyway women complete man...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> i am talking 2 u right now
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Most guys would say, oh, that's lame... you should shoot yourself for even asking it.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> but she does it now with everyone.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> tell her off and be very careful.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> Don't sweat it, my mom is actually pretty nice.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> Or, tell him to tell your kids to pick their stuff up.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_35> .... here's a hint... make it a good one!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Is it hot in here or is it just you?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> So Even If they are not thinking, It really Gels :)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Soppy version at [1] and geek version at [2].
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Not if you just met this guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> a kind that only you can know and love.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if not , then it probably means nothing.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> get on your knees and take care of him .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Soppy version at [1] and geek version at [2].
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Not if you just met this guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if not , then it probably means nothing.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> get on your knees and take care of him .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> if your just talking about normal everyday things then he probly likes you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> I USED A TIME OUT CHAIR FOR ALL FOUR OF MY BOYS AFTER A FEW TIMES IT GOT BETTER.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_95> Or just bend over alot in front of him
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> you cant win the lottery if ya dont buy a ticket right?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> I met a guy on line and he handcuffed me to his van steering wheel.....so I guess I did...!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> mostly the people I know arent genuine!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I do, I think its cute.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> she is obsessed and that is a big problem.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> why in the freakin hell would you do that?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Make the one that is right for you.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> mostly the people I know arent genuine!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> I do, I think its cute.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> she is obsessed and that is a big problem.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_25> why in the freakin hell would you do that?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> Make the one that is right for you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> If he loves you, then why does he have a need to cheat?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> Once a porn watcher, always a porn watcher so its probably something you'll just have to accept.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> BE YOURSELF and have a good sense of humor!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> yes i belieave,bcoz my self also love at firstsight,i will never COMPRAMISI...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> Probably the single best way to get a conversation going with girls is to use PEOPLE TALK.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> It feels like your weak at the knees.. You'll just know.. trust me!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> I want my girl petite, sociable, witty and sweet
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Well, it also depends on if you want a good relationship w/ your ex.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> why would a girl stop loving a guy who realy loves her more than anything???
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> No matter what age you two are, that is always a BIG step.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> U can tok 2 her personally 2 let her know that u want to continue ur friendship.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> ^ as far as greeting each other later on...i disagree with that.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> YOU HAVE HURT ME AND OUR KIDS BEYOND REPAIR.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> I think it depends on the woman...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> if you are going to loose it take a time out from the discussion.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> girl like nerds cos they are cute n look honest..
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> He did cheat on you once,o.k that might be a mistake but twice?!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> my parents still dont know i've had boyfriends.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> Two people both want my attention...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> well first take a deep breath.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> She may want to get rid of you...
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> I even sometimes see me walking on the beach with her.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Anyway, ur ex doesn't care so carry on with your life.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> NO... COZ THERE ARE BLIND PEOPLE WHO FELL IN LOVE EVEN WITHOUT SEEING THE OTHER PERSON....
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Look man... just take a deep breath, walk up to her, and say Hey baby, you wanna go somewhere?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> but if you think something of it your probably less sure than you thought.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> You have a good thing going where you are.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> first of all you didnt give your age.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> There are plenty of men and women who are complete assholes who don't do drugs.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> How cold of someone to do something like that!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> i cant ask her directly as we dont talk now
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> You only get married if you love someone, not because you're having a baby.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> i hate it with a passion.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> let him know it was fun puppy love
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Call me weird or whatever, even if I never have one, I still strongly believe it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> It will no doubt keep you in her mind!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_55> if they are living with you then yes.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> get out in the real world.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> I think their is a 'special someone' for everyone!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> Also, know how to dance...  ...you gotta remember ONS should be natural, so you can't force it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> just be honest about your feelings
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> or just send back as spam?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> is this what you stay up at night thinking about?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> She's awesome, I don't think she thinks of me any more than a friend.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> if u say she still acts and talks like she still likes u chances are she is.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_30> But hey, if you like him, flirt back, if not, dont talk to him.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> lol   Sencon Advice: if you dont wanna spend money for that.. then!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> ooooh la la - the HOTTEST!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> Some people think it's wads of cash that make a life worthwhile.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> Mark with pencil where each one will go.

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> women retain water ,and have periods when men don't
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> it will probably be difficult for her at first (i know im a mom!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> no she souldnt do that becuase if she does shes not over him yet and shes Fing you over
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> C'mon it's not like we are in college anymore!
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_30> But keep in mind nobodys perfect... Not even you
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_50> wow that really does sound annoying .. well one thing you could do is do it back to her.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_30> If you act adorable-but-still-hard-to-get, then he'll go insane if you DON'T kiss him!!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> Back up the truck a bit.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> Just enjoy it,if its meant to be, it`s meant to be.Been there,done that
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Just don't forget about the one in puerto rico .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I have many guy friends, that i dont have feelings for.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> if not u'll never know, what the outcome.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Back up the truck a bit.

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> if not u'll never know, what the outcome.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> yes, it is cheating if he/she finds it out.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> Dont change your standards for a guy cuz then you will never be happy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> I dont know how I feel about her.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> I think you know what I mean...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Not all guys cheat, just the ones who are not in love with one person yet.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> i would take pictures and sell them
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_10> JUST LEAVE AND QUIT THINKING TOO MUCH
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> my best friend is in puerto rico and i'm here in new jersey and i miss her a lot
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> focus on the outcome you want.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> If you don't care, do what ever.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> just be onist with him and if he gets all emotional on u walk away
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> It sounds like she is insecure, which is probably why she got upset when you talked to her boyfriend.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> why are you telling your mom??
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> Check the caller ID on the phone, any numbers you don't know?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> If you ask Why do men cheat?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> So I would know most men are real SOB's.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> Tell me yes or no and what I should say!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Well it sucked to be alone on new year's.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> listen to what a woman has to say, but don't be needy of her opinion.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> just don't go into thinking its all going to be peaches and cream.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> you should go talk 2 her.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> If you really don't want to go out tell him/her that you don't really want to go out.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> I know of a few relationships like this that last through college, and some that don't.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_50> and its also selfish to be with two people.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> Oh, that’s right, I’ve met you only in my dreams.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Maybe she'll change her mind, maybe she'll be your BFF :)
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> What if you were in the sixth grade and you had a seventh grade BF?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Try to remember that guys do not want to talk too long about these things.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> yeah and turn your back on her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> act like a virgin and your man will do anything for you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> It seems that u r not meant for each other.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> 1 don't know any girl who isn't interested in this sort of thing !
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Also, does he get a lot of hangups at home?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> If you fail to later on you would regret
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> Be it their looks, habits, lifestyle, friends...whatever!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> Its so hot when you love the person.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> Not the SAME thing, but comparable.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> Probably so: it is SOOO easy and can even be fun at times!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> but things that are good are often expensive
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> <----be my favorite first date right there!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> I HAVE HAD MANY FRIENDS DO THSAME TO BOYS AS WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Some are fathers and some are not.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> i have mostly guy friends and trust me they know im there!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> I bet he thinks that question is about him.... lol
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> but you have to take that first step before hand.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Ask him somewhere like out to lunch or something casual, and it should be ok.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> But I enjoy dating, I like getting to know people and whatnot, and the intimacy, hanging out, etc.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> if your not out of the closet how do u know that u want to date other woman?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> I would be pretty suspicious if she called her ex every day.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> umm wow lot of stuff going on there.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> ;)  Where-I have used Match.com and LavaLife, but i have now met a wonderful guy off a silly site!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> another piece of advice, use protection!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> now the police are involed so what should i do ???
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> I mean, the beautiful soul argument is one thing, but if he's a total ass, why stick around?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Well i still talk to this guy, and he still thinks im someone im not.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Move on--if you cared about someone there would be no struggle
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> violation try chat rooms and look for her friends...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> I know I wouldn't want my 14 year old daughter accessing Yahoo!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> You should not marry some one that has already cheated on you twice.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> Hpv is a vd and yes he must probably cheated on you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> straight men like big breasts and big butts.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> pretty soon you won't be able to have your own friends, money etc.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Do you know the best way to lose a friend.?.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> think if you really love him/her or not and then just tell him/her
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> MAKE HER THINK U GIVING HER MONEY BUT DO NOT ...IT WORKS LIKE MAGIC
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> MAYBE YOU JUX DONT TRUST HER DUDE
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> tell her youre being careful (you better be!)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> I'm going to watch the answers you get (just in case!)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> come out with it just tell him how u feel.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> but i dont really like him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> A married man and woman expressing love, and reproducing, Then it's good.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> should it be time to hear wedding bells ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> they just aren't able to take the pain.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Acutally, I give the BOYS the flowers!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> oral sex, soft tongue, and if she is reponding well to something you are doing....keep doing it!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> I can't say he's a love, but I sure lust him secretly.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Just make sure you are still friends and enjoy !
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Seduce a guy in a gay bar and if you can go all the way you are gay/
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Try to go somewhere that has stuff you're interested in like  a  bookstore,coffee shop, sports, etc.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> or just ask them if they notice anything diff.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> when ypu put that person infront of your needs and wants first
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> What did you/he do for ya'll to split up?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Just tell them in a nice way tha tyou dont feel the same.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> but i think is nice to fall in love as many time as you can in you life time.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> i dont really think so but thats me.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> WHEN YOU START THINKING THAT YOU DON'T MIND LIVING WITH THIS GIRL THE REST OF YOUR LIFE!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> If the eyes look to the side, it's sighn of defense.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> Because some men (not all) are dirtbags!
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_45> some marry because it's time to.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> please dont asked y. just answer yes or no.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> and wait patiently for mr. right.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> well just let them have a change they might end up having what u guys didnt..
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> so dont bother waiting... there are a lot more guys that's worthy of your attention.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> NORMAL MEANIN ONE THAT DOESNT HAVE A ONE TRACK MIND THATS SET ON SCREWING!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> Their neck and back rubbed, the place beteween their shoulders, hard there?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> so we can learn to get back up who knows you just might fly take care
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> he doesnt invite her to go with him to his familys house.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> They now have two more kids after that and yes the guy had changed.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> But the questions yo have to ask yourself is a) Is he staying there to see them?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> Then, if things go well, go ahead and ask him!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> so we can learn to get back up who knows you just might fly take care
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> he doesnt invite her to go with him to his familys house.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> They now have two more kids after that and yes the guy had changed.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> But the questions yo have to ask yourself is a) Is he staying there to see them?

<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> cause we always get what we want.thats why and we get a lot of a tension
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> I knew a guy who did just that.

<NbChars_260> <LevSim_30> Sure, go ahead= You better not  8.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> I Mean se.x is more fun than anything espesially with an ex.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> whats wrong with brown eyes, brown skin?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> But on the other hand, some guys just like to flirt with girls or talk to girls.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Just look past her, like she's not even there.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> first time  for both of  us
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> If she likes music, an ipod would be good.

<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> Like a lust in my body!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> i kinda feel intimadated and think ill be turned downed or be made fun of or something.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> My heart says She's the one, stay with her...STAY WITH HER!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> I accidently said I love you too.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> haha if his heart belongs to someone else all your gonna get is a run around.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> and if not, then at least your still friends.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Are you thinking about her often?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> Thats just beggin' for presents sweetie...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Instead of saying something like, I'm sick of hearing about your boyfriend!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> If in doubt go to In'n'out burger.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> i get the whole insecure thing.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_55> Then you know you love them
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Give him a promise to give hime somthing .
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_60> Give him an ultimatum - the porn or you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Only what you make of it.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> Does he want to know what you are like in Bed???
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> WHEN SHE DOES SUPPORT HER AND TELL HER THAT SHE'S THE MOST BEUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> We met last year on Yahoo Personals and got married last month!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> because, gay guys understand girls, straight guys don't.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> and then after wards you can take her out to eat and talk about the movie.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> There is this guy that I like.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> I'm a guy myself so I know how we think.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_15> WHY DO I LOOK SO GOOD???
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> although is a kiss really ever innocent?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> When she starts fighting with you just tell her...
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_50> also, ask her what feels good.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Im not shallow and I trully do love him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Well anyway, its what I do.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> hmm.. r u not tellin her something?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> when you find out let me know!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> My advice to you is MOVE ON!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Im not shallow and I trully do love him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Well anyway, its what I do.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> hmm.. r u not tellin her something?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> when you find out let me know!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> My advice to you is MOVE ON!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> girls do like like nerdy-looking smart confident guys i.e.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> best love pair would be sohni mahiwal.i like there love story.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> just cause mama says it doen't mean its true
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> and think of a different plan.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> yes , if u are sure he will keep the family ,like work and bring money in.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> Yes I have a million (well really ten but you know)gay friends.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> and no it's not necessarily you , but them.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> Depends... are you both married or single?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> NEVER DO ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN'T LIVE WITH TOMORROW .
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> I have no idea why they're like that.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> Lunch date, dinner date, movie date - no issues.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_25> She'll do what you tell her to do.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> keep us satisfied at home and we wont.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> have you been having sex with your boyfriend?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Don't always cut your hair like a guy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> She could have been just struggling financially and looking for a sugar daddy.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> sometimes you think you know,it drives you crazy, and he's really not guilty.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> happyness dosnt always come from beauty.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> trust me girly once they see you in a skirt withsome clevage showing they diff.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> here it is the answer to when a man is considered a sex adict  when he is born...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Just because you don't have that latest gadget or car doesn't mean what you already have isn't good.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> In my oppinion SEX is the one that even animals can do.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> i am in the 7th grade and my parents let me date so what should i do
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> take care of your appearence but dont obsess.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> u dont it just hits ya in the bak of the head
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If he's not, don't worry, there are others out there.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> he doesnt want me to tell the father.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> I love a woman with full lips, a nice round butt, and big breast.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Thats like asking if a guy likes blow lobs.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> YES U CAN BUT SON'T U THINK THAT U NEED SOME TIME TO TRUELY KNOW EACH OTHER MORE
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_45> Sign up for the ones you like.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> just be sure not to get smashed!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> - How old are his kids?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> love aint got much to do with it, its more of a money thing
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> Any way, Who cares I would like you any way even if it was past your sholders !!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Of course there is, just depends on what exactly your looking for in someone.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> take a few minutes and really get a take look down there.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> maybe not the ovaries...but it would hurt like heck!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> I do that to all my guy friends.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Sure, men think with their little heads.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> you say: Do you wanna go out?.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> So your an ass and p)ssy man eh?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> usually it starts with a kiss..good luck!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> i was very ugly guy at the time i proposed her but now i am smart and cool.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> KISS.com ... that's where I found mine :)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> i just dont like for a women to lie to me .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> i think the most price-less gift in the world.. but instead of it..people in iran(my country)..bye bunch of flower...roze.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> tell the girl u think she`s rlly beautiful and u`de like to get to kno her better.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> I'm tired with the i'm a commit-phobe excuse!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> I think it sounds like you have some truly busy friends!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> If not then it's her loss.right?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> I think these buz cuts that guys have look really stupid.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Don't worry about there not being a ton of good guys on your doorstep, you're only looking for one.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Tell him you love him to, but just not in the way he may be looking for.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> yes i am 12 and i think im im love w/ this guy named thomas
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> But if u need one word ____   generally I go with   Understanding  .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> I love men because that's the way God intended it to be.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> than you pretty much know what to do.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Once a guy sees you as a female, you can never go back.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> everyone does things at their own pace.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> There are so many hot guys out there.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> Get another girlfriend or have her stop doing what shes doing.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> how do i go about telling him?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> Firstly I hope you're not my girlfriend!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> first thing first;  1.did you date for a while?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> I don't like it because I put styling stuff in my hair and its not easy to run through.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> If she's accepting the gifts...watch out.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> You gotta do this: nothing ventured, nothing gained.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> Now I am scared to call her cuz I dont know what to say.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> Well, I'm a guy so no.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> You can not get that guy to like you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> what she will do then for you to hide it for so long.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> maybe because she regretted and just realized what she has lost?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> if she never lied and u never asked.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> You just do it, if it is that big of a deal.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> there are no girls that play hard like i do that i like to hang out with.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_45> plus it just sounds like your infatuated with him and maybe want nothing more than a physical relationship
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> sometimes being single is more fun.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> Im sure he loves his girlfriend right now, but is it really anything serious?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> but i still do wonder who's hotter?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> I dont get him I thought guys were supposed to call girls.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> Don't knock the ganja til you try it.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> He/She is the person that I've been waiting for!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> If people ask say ya, but if they don't ask don't say anything.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> if all else fails tell her your greatgreatgrandfather helped write the kama sutra!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Should I just forget it and leave it alone or should I act on it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Nah don't do it he might go crazy and turn in to a pshyco...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> if you just want to have fun, go for it then.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> wait you will be so much happier!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> It would be soooooooo much easier..Lol.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> But he is such a great guy and loves her for who she is.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> i told my boyfriend before i knew i was that i might be pregnant by my ex.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> But if you ask and he says no then your left with the dissapointmet.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> i'm doing that now and i'm in a fantastic relationship with an incredible man.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> he's an ex for a reason right ?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> then think of sumthin that has to deal with that to ask her out.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> and i really love the guy a lot so i kind of dont want to break up.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> why are you thinking of him?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> hi im in the same position, my boyfriend lives out of state.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> but don't take this for granted,okay?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> and you will be happy if he is happy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> It feels good and it hurts like hell.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> If it was about a meal ticket/way to USA only, why not a more virile young man?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Why don't you watch it with him?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Cause you girls got it going on!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I don't have a best friend though .
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> well u can't get the other perosn out of your head
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> as usual, only time can tell!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> I broke up with this guy because I felt like he was suffocating me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> If you love him and he loves you then you'll know..
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> slap a condom on go at it
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> So hang out where these people hang out
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> she hates sex, and does it to get what she wants, your money, power, or/and fame.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> THE SAD STORY IS..THAT WE WILL ALL BE DEAD!!!!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> HANDSOME SMART OPEN-MINDED AND DON'T MIND BEING HIMSELF
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> After all, if you get married, its gonna be their kid too.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> take them both to see brokeback mountain.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> if your partner isnt happy without sex that person isnt worth it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Pick her up and take her to a park for a picnic.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> You're not with the guy anymore, so why bother?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> bcuz they r fun 2 talk to bcuz they act like gurlz so its like havin a girl friend
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> I love you =Let's have sex now  6.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> com'on now...half the world is shallow.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> no ur not, ur just on passing time till mr right comes along...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> you are scared , your probaby not alone, he's probably thinking the same thing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> no, alot of the stuff i`ve gotten that was xpensive just fell apart
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> You need to consider, what if you get pregnant?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> cause there lame asses  get a girlfriend or 2!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> no ur not, ur just on passing time till mr right comes along...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> You need to consider, what if you get pregnant?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> cause there lame asses  get a girlfriend or 2!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> they could go shoping wiff you  tho
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> its like somethings always missing in your life..and guess what, its Love.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Because you smoke, amd smokers arn't worth loyalty lol
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> But my brother tells me that guys leave 'good' girls for 'not so good' girls for one MAIN reason.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> If you have to ask how to do it, you probably couldn't do it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> has he meet her in person?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Whatever you do don't make the first move!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> I call her my sexy little kitten.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> remember, u cud b anything from straight-bi-les-trans.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> i want to get a girlfriend.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> i guess you can say yes.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> I don't see anything wrong if a girl walks by and just says hi.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Why can she not do this?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> )and his reason was so i could go out with jonny.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> BUT IN MY LIFE BEING A MAN, I THINK THAT THWY ARE GREAT.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> And if he does like you ask him OUT.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> you should always have trust in a relationship.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> its for the thrill....they like the excitement of hiding out and cheating....it makes them feel good i guess.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Don't listen to anyone around you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> You gotta say it outloud or it's hard to understand.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> pack your things and leave nd never look back.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Bad Boy bad boy what ya gonna do!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> It depends if he loves you back?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_15> DO NOT TRY TO CHANGE A PERSON IT NEVER WORKS!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> i think it's too ordinary to have sex on the bed.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> DO YOU DAYDREAM ABOUT YOUR FUTURE WITH THIS PERSON?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> Read what I said in your other question where I'm posted!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Let him go...it's hard but trust that life has someone EVEN BETTER out there for you...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> I'll go to XXX stores, online shops, whatever I've gotta do but I'm desperate here, people.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> I would not shower her with gifts.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> buy him a outfit or talk to him about it
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> you need to put your foot down.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_30> I think he'd cheat on you.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> its certainly sex for the guy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> does he love you too much not to let such beliefs come in the way?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> She may just be busy with other friends too, or maybe playing a little hard to get.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> well, not ALL girls like the bad boy type.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> im sure she will be just fine and anyone can look pretty with confidence.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Lett him know you still care!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> i really feel uneasy whenever hes around.. wat shud i do?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> iam here to help for free/
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> What kind of comments is she making?...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> well i dont consider it a jungle.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> Save yourself that, you deserve better!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> about 8 hours a day!----that is way too much!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> HERES A ANSWER Noooooooooooooooooooo   WELL I WOULD HATE A CLASS CLOWN i guess if he were smart like me
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Do some of the fun things you 2 did before you got married.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> and leave you out of it.
<NbChars_260> <LevSim_20> Once a cheater ALWAYS a CHEATER.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Should I wait until he gets home?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> They were friends and husband and wife.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> My friend, you will not come between a fat grrr and her prey!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> If I'm answering questions like this one, a lot!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> I'm IN LOVE with my best friend.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> you should just leave him alone..do u want to be happy or just keep rehashing the past
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> You will give a special gift to your wife on your wedding night!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> you are assuming that all girls are the same.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> thats right, i said creep, because thats what any man is who would cheat on his wife!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Not only would I date a white guy I would marry one too...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> making love is by having sex.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> as long ur husband heart wif u then everything is fine.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> it is how you use it, not the size
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> i would like to chat with you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> So many girls even marry men like their fathers without even realizing it and the same with boys.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> the person has been a virgin for so many years already.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> guys and gals have affairs because the want to love and to be loved.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> Gold earing looks terrible on most guys.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> NO I'm not between 12 & 17 and NO I'm not gay.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> PREFERIBLY: Nice body (Not miss universe), smart, leading, VIRGIN, honest, etc, you know, the good things.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> i think that you should .
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Just hang out with her all the time.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> or, if you recently started exercising a lot, that could do it.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> i always ask for a sugestion to where we should go/eat/do/which movie to see.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> I want to be your best friend forever and ever!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> is she worth a friend to you?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> people used to get married at that age!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> Don't try to get him back.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_45> if is genuine then go for it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> FLIRT WITH HIM BUT DONT TELL YOUR BROTHER    ITS THE BEST      START THE FLIRTING GIRL!!!!!!!
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_25> watch out for the poetry slinging players on here
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> BESIDES, BY TIME I HIT MY BED @ NIGHT I'M ONLY 1-2MINUTES AWAY FROM SLEEP.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Thats why dating comes before marriage;-) Good luck!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> He obviously does not care that much about me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> the best way is to catch him off guard.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> i mean they say it is and well i dont think it is.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> U can't,she has to convince herself.U could only give her reasons why she should.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> I don't really know why I like freckly redheads.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> The man it is somewere near the anus...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> They say opposites attract, so why not give it a shot?!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> i dont think so, shes grown and legal and so are you GO FOR IT
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i don't think that you're ready either.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> brains... though i haven't found a single girl with 'em
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> Please, don't even bother to say 'I love you' until like... 99th date?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i like all kinds of women.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> there are tons, but really think about it, my sister did it that way and now she regrets it.....
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> if not discuss it with you wife.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> some are very erotic and some are offensive.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> (Grass is always greener syndrome)  But really, I say, better the lover you know than the devil you don't.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> or is more attracted to me when other guys are looking at me, or attempting to get with me.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> You make love because you're in love...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> If you suck at that, get better somewhere else, say.....oral sex.
<NbChars_320> <LevSim_20> Talk to her about it first.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> AND HE HASNT GIVEN UP ON YOU EITHER!!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> just wait a bit and see where it goes .
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> However I can say when I was in 8th grade I did it( I am now 26) .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> We have been married 12 years now, have 4 kiddos, and I am still crazy about him!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> So I guess that is what I look for.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> that problem is that i like both of them but i talk about the other guy then my boyfd.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> IF YOU ANSWER YES TO ANY OR ALL OF THE FOLLOWING THEN I GUESS YOU CAN CALL IT LOVE.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> they will do something like  ........ that might ruin their life!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> i'm afraid you r going wrong.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> If she really loves u she'll do all the above mentioned stuffs.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> And I already gave her $40.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_25> mabe you just dont ask and ya should
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> Besides all that, boyfriends aren't that great anyway.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> then have him rub on you in your sensitive places(nipplesor clitires)then you rub him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> noway get rid of him once a cheater always a cheater if no physcaly menaly
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> Why would you date a guy if you like his cousin.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> Only if you feel like you wanna do that
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_30> v ofn gt 2 lov those pple whoom v dnt wanna!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> thats when love will find you.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> gud question hunnie im goin tru the same thin..... a suggestion..... 4get about him and move on
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> master bate and think of him...and ad adult toys to the forplay
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Call the police if she said it you could be next...Dummy
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> All I know is that when I see a pretty mane of red hair I think  Whoa!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> better yet ask a friend of his if he has even mentioned you!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Eventually she'll balk and say,   I give up!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> 4- Is it your job to protect these guys from her and their own foolish behaviors?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> well, good luck , I hope it works!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> Then ask one of them out.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> Tell this person straight up, that you like them as a friend but it stops there.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> the same way you would marry a purple lady.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_10> MAYBE IF YOU FORGIVE KIANNA'S SINS AS GOD FORGIVES YOURS!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> also what that other guy said, too little body fat can make your period late.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> Sex means you don't really care about the person.. you just want sex.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> you'll be happy in the end, trust me!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> If she/he is trying to kill you, GET OUT!!!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> and your willing to go farther.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> don't worry about it i'm sure that your very attractive and you stand out.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> You sound like someone that is desparate for love!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> Most of the guys don't get scared of girls.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> I don't know much else to say?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> enjoy your life and im not saying dump him ya'll just need to move slow.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> they r being honest, but not in the real sense.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> JUST GET OVR HIM HE'S APPEREANTLY A JERK AT LEAST THT WAT HE SOUNDS LKE 2 ME !!!!!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> sit down at a nice dinner and try and weedle out of her what is bugging her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> just go up to him in front of a group of ppl and say, ok you suck, it's over.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> actually it doesn't look like he wants it to keep going.... sorry for that.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> how are babies made and what are the risks of pregnancy
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Either way, you won't know unless you just ask.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> so, did you have sex with her?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> It's because everyone just likes to have sex
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Obviously that person got some Fukin issues..
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> If your hot just wait if not be more aggresive
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> They thought they were in love, but fifteen, sixteen, seventeen is just too young to know what love is.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> to tell u the truth,  i dont no im not married
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> I saw you from afar and couldnt help but not if atleast say hi.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> So it was easier to not get that deeply involved with someone at too young an age.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> Nothing is worse then sitting at home with nothing to do but think about that person.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> i am 13 and i am NOT gay
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> well say it nicely to avoid offending & hurt her feelings
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> how did you know that she have a picture on the dating internet???????
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Forget it  size does not matter at all.. for enjoyment...
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> Your man had better LOVE you.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> I dont think there is anything funny about something like that.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> SOME     s DO have morals and hope for REAL love!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> you should love who you really love....
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> She even lied about having cancer one time for attention!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> i don't know that that can be proven.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> i'm 23 and i'm still virgin and i'm proud of it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> I TRIED BUT IT DIDN'T WORK.........
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> and 2 if she dont wanna go for it then no....  enjoy her safty
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> wow, what are you in like the 2nd grade?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> I bet you wouldn't like that other girl very much either.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> like yall are able to read our minds.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_10> HELL NO IT DON'T MATTER IF SHE YOUNGER OR OLDER .THERE HAVING BABES AT CRAZY AGE NOW
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Yeah, never sounds like a good answer.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> don't sleep with then any more
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> sometimes jungle fever means that its an interracial relationship
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> yeah baby lol .. show sum skin or w.e u gotta do yanno lol
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> If you aren't, then we'll wait, but not too long.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> what kind of thing is that to ask??
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Stay true to who you guys were .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> YES YOU CAN, YOU NEED TO REMEMBER WHY YOU FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE .
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> HE HAS A PLAN FOR YOU AND THESE MEN ARE NO LONGER PART OF IT.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_25> at first it isn't very nice.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> at first it is kind of uncomfortable, but then you get used to it.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> i love her so much,,, she dont know!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> Imagine if they really liked a girl and she totally turned him down.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> yes very much i love justin we kissed just today and a lot more ;)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> And if that man knows she's doing this stuff...how stupid he must be to stay!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_5> GO A LITTLE FURTHER SOUTY AND YOU WILL HAVE IT ALL
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> I got a around 7.5 penis is it a good size?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> YOu are fine, just don't marry one of them.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> He has moved on, be happy for him, wish him well, & get on with your own life.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> therefore it belongs to no one
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Don't knock it till u try it.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> Now if all of you are just best friends.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> You sound like a stalker get some help
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> And some women, especially big, beautiful, CONFIDENT women, are just extremely sexy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> You already seem to know the guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> and you find out he's screwing some other girl and telling her he loves her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> isn't there something unusual that you know she wants?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> so my boyfd got mad and never talk to him .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> you will just know you will feel it
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> yea i think its' ok to date someone old then what you are now.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> just depends on the person... some like one or the other... some like both.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> and nice guys can be just as adventurous and exciting as those bad boys.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> this guy is still inlove with his exwife.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> i feel wierd about this but do you like me cuz i like you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Have you ever heard of  ....love the one you're with...  Go to the dance with him and have fun!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> If you are ok with it, and noone will get hurt then I don't see why not.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> try ur hardest to win her back.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Just don't try talking to her.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> not required but much more fun that way.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> r u sure u love her??
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> i think they do..........  its just like when white women like black men  its the same
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> more info, we are both in our very late twenties.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> You're a good friend, and I even have stronger feelings than just that!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> There sexy and a turn on!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Your heart tell you to go and tell her!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> I NEED A PILL THAT CAN MAKE ME LAST MUCH LONGER!!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if they don't believe in their own attractiveness.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Not all women are like that.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> No, everyone is not between 12 & 17 OR gay.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> And don't worry - if you raise your child right, they won't think bad of YOU!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> And never try to get him to... ever again.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> So see how she feels about it and then get her drunk!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> well first of all a guy would not flirt with someone that he is not attracted to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> might not hurt to ask them.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> no mostly love, honor and cherish in modern ceremonies, older ones are obey
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> but let say you are a boy.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> when i was 21 i had a girlfriend that was 28 so no i dont think so.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> when your girl friend/boy friend will say Hell Yeah!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> so please don't blame those who have affairs.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> anyone who opens their eyes around him.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> When your on a tight budget.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> it doesnt matter who they are, if they are married, they are totally off limits!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> you have a lot of time, don't rush into n e thing.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> he probably wants you for the wrong reasons.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> yes i am in love, with my children and grandchildren unconditionally!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> If you guys don't talk enough, that means one of many things.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> they sometimes use it to control and sometimes just pull away from it and that can cause more jealousy
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> Don't you think he will cheat on you, his girlfriend.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Well, I couldn't have said it any better.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> this makes me wonder how old you are?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> When she tells you more emtional stuff than ever
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> 2- see that there woman is so in love in controling them.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> So like browneyedmaiden said Be careful because men never truely grow up.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> good luck, and try it in home
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> Well, here are some ways to cheat on him:  Cheat on him the way he cheated on you.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> I think you might be (lol)
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> my boyfriend never calls me and never writes it wouldn't be so bad if he weren't 2 states away!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> ther is no rush for kiss and se* .
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> tell them to chill out, they obviously are selfconsious about something
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> Oh...you want one of those friends!A sex buddy.Booty call.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> what do you mean by like.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Ask one of your friends to ask him and see what he says.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> you can use things you find around the house to do this.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Whoa dude... you've got to be careful here.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> nope, there is nothing wrong with you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> But I think that he just wants sex and I dont want that plus he  has a girl friend!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> leave him, you wouldn't like that to happen to you, right.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> and we get along just fine.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_45> i do not know how to get a good one.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_25> start flirtin wit him or somethin .. tahts wut turns me on!
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> WHY are they mad at you?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> Sort of like why women like to hang with gay men.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> No, size does not realy matter, unless a guy is too big.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> like a blackjack dealer told me once.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> 1  well if she want it go ahead......... but make it with safty .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> i believe that men are truly from mars and we are from venus!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> Are thongs comfortable I am thinkin on gettin one?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Hey you can find any whore any where but is it really worht it?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> my friend taylor has gone out with both of them about half a month after we broke up.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> these days anything could possible be an outcome.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> a good way to tell is if he teases you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> i dont know what to do im going to her house to see her today.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_10> JUST TELL HIM WAT U THINK
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Probably because most Americans are downright lazy, or maybe just stupid!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> YOU SHOULD QUIT DATING LOSERS AND CONS.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> stay home, cook a good meal and get a dvd
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Luckily I found a woman with both.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> we kissed on the 1st date and things have been going great.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_30> And if he's still scared, he's probably just scary.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> can you introduce me to anyone who would like it
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Then you get the benefit out of the deal too!
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_25> now if a guy is involved all bets are off they go for the throat..
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_25> maybe by talking about skimpy topics.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> just be glad u hav him im a only kid i know what its like........
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> I read alot about this issue and so I am telling you this all.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_45> I like this really cute guy, he's not in my class he's in my friends class.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Grab him and give him a big smooch!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if you like a bowl of soup then wouldnt a biger bowl be even better ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> No this is not love!If he really loved you it wouldnt matter!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> learn how to roll with it ever so cautiously, or get out of the jungle.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> sure if he would like it
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> well i have definately been there done that, it was horrible.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> playful in the bedroom is a huge plus!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> It's not like i want to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Just love her too if you like her.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> aint nothing wrong with it do what u do i think more people should be like that
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> try talking to her friends and see what she likes.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> invite him for dinner ur parents will get to know him and will trust him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> trust me, she will like it, coz that was what my bf gave me that really touched my heart!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> IT ENDS UP HURTING WORSE IN THE END IF YOU HIDE THEM.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> This worked for me: Hi, my name is Kevin.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Ask him if he'd like to go to the movies with you next Saturday.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> I thought that was just me but I guess not
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Then if your'e shy to start right away, Just have fun around him!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> when u are an adult or in love.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> B'caz u think urself very smart & clever.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE MEANS OR HOW TO IMPROVE MY CONVERSATIONS.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> If that doesn't work than go find someone else to like.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_50> she may not be perfect but there is sumone out there for you!!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> call her right now and say hey, I'm gay then take it from there.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> plz if u get some nice ans then tell me too...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> (if you know what I mean)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Guys want a thin, pretty girl who can handle the housework.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> between the F spot and the H spot.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> why in the wrolrd does your wife want you to have an affair?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> going out with someone to make your ex jelous is so pathetic!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Tell him if youre girl f**ked her friend would he like it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> also, it helps if shes got a nice set of cans
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> U NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.GOOD LUCK.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_20> He broke up w/ me 4 month ago.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> the other guy took my idea
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Find a nice girl and marry her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> nope, maybe a kiss on the cheek but you dont need to make out if you dont want to.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> like most of us really are.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> try dropping hints if you like him and see how he reacts.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> does not matter if the man is older but it does matter if the man is married.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> if he really loves you he will wait and not push you!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> I love doggy, its the best.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> why dont they think about love ,care,and somethink about love should do?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> go up to him smack him on the butt and say when are you taking me out?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> It is always wrong to cheat!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> oooohh, tough call, how did u find out about it!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> I'm sugarlump and he is Sqog!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> he will even get me presents for no reason!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> be honest about it girl ok just be honest oh yeah i'm a guy by the way
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> only if it is beyond repair
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> However, do not use it to just get some.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> there is nothing wrong.. its just we're not used to it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I dream of my son alot.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> sex is just sex no strings attached.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> He's married .... BAD KARMA ... BAD KARMA
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> (When she ducks out to the bathroom?)
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> If you like a guy and think he likes you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> This way if you feel they will say no, don't do it yet.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> i totally feel you on this one.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Just don't become the bad guy in your son's eye.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> that's the best thing to do it.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> only you can know when it's right for you.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> it's sort of par for the course in this jungle.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> i want to call her so much but i never have the guts to
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> HELL YEAH you make the cut.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> They don't want to hurt the guy.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> Hmmm not sure what to think of what you said.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> if u are a lezbo..lol no if u really love her lol sure..
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> humiliate him by catching them kissing
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> I am 16 and looking for a friend to chat with ..but there isnt anyone..What to do?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> they dont want the whole bad boy only a little.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> #2: Do you really want to get back or get even?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_10> ATLEAST PRETEND TO HAVE IT ORELSE HE MIGHT SEE ANOTHER FOR IT.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> but then I said it outloud.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> you would be jealous as hell
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> what do you have to lose ??
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> If you do, I'd like to ask you WHY???
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> IF he is so willing to ruin a good thing for a fling, then he is not worth it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> If he even dares to f**k u then tell him it's right.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> you will never be happy if you ask that...you better say....i just want my life back...good luck to you:))
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> And I cant meet a decent guy on the internet.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_25> People always say once a cheater always a cheater.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> Some people even do not kiss until their wedding day to keep it special.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> say u love himat the very first and u cant live without himin ur life...easy!
<NbChars_280> <LevSim_20> nope once a cheater always a cheater
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> ;)  Little things a woman does is very noticable too.....pony tail.....ribbon in her hair.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Sorry, I have a b*tch already...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> i'm so sorry to hear that.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> if he flirts back he might be a player.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> go for it but don't over do it.good luck!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> He's a cheating ******* and using you too!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> It's weird, I know, but, that's the way they are.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> we dont need to find a good looking person in order fall in love with.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> my answer's too late but i would give u some advice though...

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I love her and she loves me.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> Have you try different kinds of guys, like guys who like spicy women.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> It means that you are looking at other girls to  hard & making her feel insecure
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> well comb apparently grandma loves u you r still here right.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> try to see it from his point of view ok.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> can't wait for the answer to this one
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> i agree all the way with linda01
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> let me no when u get an answer :)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> so a lot of the time they beat around the bush, so he can tell if you like him.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Just need to tell someone it's eating me alive.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_50> Yes,Yes, Yes...... Oh yeah and sometimes sleep.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> you know, love likes a wind, you can't see but you can feel it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> You've got your whole life to live - enjoy being young and in love!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> ^_^ by the time she does climax, it will be the best, strongest one she's had.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> no.. you have to have the real deal
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> and you will end up broken hearted.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> life is so difficult right now please help!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Think about that before you give yourself away.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Either way he's going to need you to be there for him!
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_30> so is this the same girl?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> :)  I hope you will get married.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> It was a hard break up to get over, more so I think because of what I invested!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> Just tell your man you've had enough and it's you or her.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> mostly insecure men want to do this to stroke their ego.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> I think it's good to wait until you are married to have sex.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> we just can't live together as man and wife anymore.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> does anyone know how this is.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> The one I found below is located out of CA!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> And you won't stop it because you're still in love with him.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> What are your dislikes and likes about gurls.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> because i dream about her all the time.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> if not yall may be growing apart.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> I know she likes someone else, but should I tell her how I feel anyway?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> go and beat the hell out of ur friends
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> So if you are that young maybe its no big deal.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> sometimes it totally depends on how he or she is classifed under class clown!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> you can have one of your friends go up to him and flirt.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> thats just ur mind playing tricks on u
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_25> ok pay attention to him flirt a lot
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_35> most -14feb 25th dec and 15th june  least-april and jan
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> Maybe if you ask her while she is drunker than bob dylan was before a concert!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> I HAVE BEEN GOING OUT WITH A GIRL 11 YEARS OLDER THAN ME FOR 11 YEARS.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> other then sticking them in a room   i suggest telling them to talk it out amonst them selves.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Salt & Pepper shakers; towels & wash cloths; silver wear; bathroom set; etc.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> if he's married then yes, duh
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> He never had sex with her?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> if you have to get proof then get through your doctor or something.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> it does not attract girls.you gotta change that be serious but not too serious.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> I don't know anyone who did it wright the first time
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Oh...and if you make Jesus the core of your marriage, everything else is even better!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> I can't even visit her or nothin and she lives right upstairs!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> There's probably where I went wrong?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> There aren't many good men out there, so be careful!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> trust me it happen to me befor k and i feel all better to.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> I dont see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> Ask him what the deal is girl.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> why do u ask this question?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> Hey Chillin...I agree wid Superman, give him your vote!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> No baby it just happen that what i think
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> But I can't help but wonder about hers.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> ask ?s, find out, depending on the answer dump him than c wats up.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> Oh I want a girlfriend but only a hot one.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> Girl says to guy, I am pregnant.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> 2 days ago, he came back!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> IF YOU THINK LIFE IS SO DIFFICULT RIGHT NOW, MAKE THE WRONG  CHOICE AND IT WILL ONLY GET WORST.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> YES...WHEN FOR A WHILE I COULDN'T STAND TO HAVE SEX WITH MY B/F?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> If you have to ask..........your are probably too young to be trying.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> But i personally dont like them
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> If you are not hot, are you nice?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> keep waiting ur friends will find you one or he/she will come to you,.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> i think it is bad because they are your friends but that doesnt make it less sad.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> Slap him around a little bit.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> with this type of arrangement .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> And I can honestly say now that I'm glad I never got the guy!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> I'm just curious....how big is the average male 'part' ????
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> the stork receives your email, and it'll be visiting ya along with a lil' brotha/sista
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> is there any sign that he like you too?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> ok first make sure he knows you exist.

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> I've being on the same boat so here goes.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> TRY TO FORGET THE BAD THING SAND LOOK AT THE GOOD .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> AbsolutLaney took the words right out of my mouth!!!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> How old are you or shall I say how young?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> I used to be that @$$ that would sleep with a girl and be done with her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> there's a chinese saying that if guys are not bad women wont lyk them...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> i think you should just go out with me
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> How about you try growing up.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> is a guy unclipping and touching my         in public good?'
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> if u did not have sex at the age of 18 u are a loser.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> well it looks like you've got 2 choices.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> you have a life to get on with and a beautiful daughter to raise.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If the guy wants to be a virgin then no
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> she would be like my best friend.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Call me... and I will prove you wrong
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> i would justed bring it up and go from there.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> it means that they want to have sex with you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> heart & trust because if they have these two they cant go wrong
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> If you truly love him then you shouldn't give up !
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> hey thats how I lost my ex wife.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Plus there are laws about that kind of thing.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> if you know what made those experiences bad .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> if she is self confident and feels sexy that is good.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> u never know what u or they can do in different places.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> you will fined this out on her eyes
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> ps:i have alot of friends that like big girlz
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Yes, just don't buy cheap ones, made with uncomfortable material!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> !stop looking and i'm sure she'll come around sooner or later.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> I don't think they always cheat, perhaps you just haven't met the right person.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> does she like u if she says no then ask her if ther is any single friends she has.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> nORMAL RANGE IS 5 - 6 INCHES THE MATTER IS NOT OF SIZE ONLY HARDNESS IS COUNT
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> Second, you can get real love by chance and luck with a guy or a girl.........whichever one u want.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> i want her be mine, not like property, but like for my eyes only, you know what i mean?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Kinda wat they said, if you really want to know, ask him...........or wait until he asks you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> if yall are sexually active it may not be u that he wants...it may just be the sex.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> Why can't I get him out of my mind?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> I THINK YOU WENT THROUGH THIS IN 5TH GRADE..IT WAS CALLED SEX EDUCATION CLASS
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> It depends on how much of the sandwich you've eaten!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> that's easy ask her once and 4 all.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> IF HE SAYS YES ASK HIM DOES HE WANT TO GO OUT SOMETIME.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> you have not contacted anyone on here have you try it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> how big is the age diff.?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> i go for $$$$, a grill, gotta have style, a car... and THEN looks aren't that big an issue
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> Not doing bad things is not enough....that is in Luke for sure, and possibly in the other 3 gospels.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> my boyfriend is the perfect man too.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Enjoy and think you're helping a friend - his wife!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> She will usually let you know =)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> you just need to let nature take its course.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> why should he gets out with ma ex in the first place... he has no right!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> I dont think girl need to worry about it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> yes at first, but it gets much more fun
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_80> My bf wants me to try it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> why ask if you dont know
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> if u really want to n really love ,yes, u shall !
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> and the affair becomes an outlet where that new person gives them what there spouse doesn't anymore.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> first do a people search.if he has a listed # it is public knowledge.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> someone who backs u up 24/7
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Either he loves you too, or its time to move on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> no way oce a cheeter always a cheeter dump his ass
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> yea i do belive so if you really like the person.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> If she dances around the question, chances are she prefers HIM!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> every1 wants sum1 dat dey can call dere own.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> DO YOU FIND YOURSELF THINKING OF THIS PERSON NO MATTER WHAT YOU ARE DOING?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> It's pretty good for me, as a saggitarian.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> Yeah i had a guy like that once.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> Some like their nipples touched and some don't at all.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> I guess we all react differently but I got a new career and a divorce and am lovin it!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> Well now we have 2 little girls and they are beautiful & wonderful, but Now our relationship sucks!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> #1: Why did you break up in the first place?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> My cousin always told me if you could suck his big toe, then you love him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Only if I was gay....I am not.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> I can't believe the monster she turned into.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> bein luved by sum1 special is like seein ur dream come true.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> AND REMEMBER  THAT YOU FALL IN AND OUT OF LOVE EVERYDAY WITH HIM.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> 1st u ask her and then love her...so simple..
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Pick some really good guys in your school and act flirty.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> she would have to approve the girl you are seeing .
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> girl if you r freaken stupid go ahead and do it but be smart and dont do it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Theres nothing wrong but to be on the safe side go see ur dr.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> is it a stupid thing 4 fall 4 someone many miles awayz from you?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> could be intresting for me too...
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> How do you even know you're gay?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> don't think about what you're going to say, or what she's going to say.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> BOTTOM LINE___________________             Your not happy get out    get out    get out move on     move on   move on
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If so it wasn't meant to be.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Well if your care for him a lot then I would say don't let him go yet.

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> first of all dont think, you must know he cheating.

<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Else dont and give value to u r parents words.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> i was on the phone with him and he asked me if i liked him and i didn't asnwer.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> you might want to start with the chubby girls first if you want a quicker response
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> n of course if u are not too young !
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> im very shy how do i break it to him?

<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> Am I gonna have to kick her @$$?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> Best friend or not, that guy needs to have his butt kicked.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> chop your head off while handing her the letter reading; I WOULD DIE FOR YOU youo be the judge!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> GIRLFRIEND,  ITS A FACT YOU ARE IN LOVE!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> If he cares for you, he'll do just that :p
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> i want to know if i am in love with someone
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> When he sees you at your worst and still thinks you're pretty!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Maybe He has, but maybe not.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> take him on a boat ride.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> either for a girlfriend or for a wife
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Check out the little white wedding chapel, tho...i have heard good things about it:-)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> Sometimes the bad boys are just sexy!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> just because your relationship sucks doesn't mean that it's hopeless.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> so y would u have 2 major girlfriends?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> you might as well start cheating on your man.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> what is it a woman does while she kisses you that turns you on the most?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Ask her out to a dance, or to a movie or something, like friends would do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> and oh i cant stop staring at him!..
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> i mean people do get curious.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Hep me out bro, am worthy, I take my oath on it.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> No, to lose your virginity you need to put your penis inside of her!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> if yes, then just pray and try to b friends.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> Don't knock it 'till you try it!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> i was 12 and it was with my sisters best friend who was 15 at the time
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> But she hides the way she is.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> 18 is a great time to start.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> YOU SAID HE HAS A GIRLFRIEND!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> But I know this is not always true ...
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> Go to a party get some ice cold water dump it on him and leave!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> wow is all i have to say to that, except that it is wrong.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> About 2 1/2-3 inches inside the vagina on the upper side, depending on the girl...guys I do not know
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> honestly girl, if you have ever seen hope floats, all the hulmilation is not worth the effort.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Just tell her that you cherish her friendship and that as friends you dont want her to get confused!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> nope not important...in fact, if she were i might get suspicios...kidding.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> pls read Isaiah 52, preferably in the Old King James--oh Lord its powerful!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> tell him you still love him and that he is sweet
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_45> it means they want 2 fuck
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> If you are really in love...does it matter?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> tell him that he is a jerk!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> CONGRATS ITS A BEAUTIFUL THING I HAVE BEEN THERE FOR THE PAST 14 YEARS AND STILL LOVING IT!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> MARRIAGE IS A BLESSING WITHOUT A DOUBT!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> yes my wife is before 24/7 3 to 4 days before she starts
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Groups are so cliche and people just need to start hanging out with whoever they want to!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> If your still having problems then you shouldnt have her.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> my girlfriend is black and sh says dat white man r the best
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> you know what goes around , comes around, so think of not to cheat.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> the clitoris and nipples because they are the most sensitive
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> Now that's something you don't hear everyday.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> Fifteen is way too young to get married.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> just walk over and simply say hi.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> I always finish WAY too soon...it gets better...I've been with my wife for 3 and a half years!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> thing of a sexy thought and i do believe your in
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> I'm sorry but I can't do this.

<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> am iunattractive or do i not stand out!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Why would you think men are the Idoits?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> high tech stuff.. thats what i want.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> Even after pills, if it still don't work, try getting her exotic pleasuring toys.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> i dont think its that late.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> does he feels comfortable being around u?

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> my wife told me that she needed a ride home.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> Well... FIRST, curvy and thin don't REALLY happen.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> Well I do like larger women's.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> moreover she told my brother she didnt like me.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Ask yourself the big question:  Who gives me butterflies?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Go up to him and say Dont lie to me I know ur dating some other girl!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> becz girls think they are clever thats why boys like cheating
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> SHOW HER THAT YOU ARE REAL AND THAT YOU LOVE HERE AND CARE ABOUT HER AND HER BODY.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> youll appreciate him more when u meet him and hell know it, in turn hell be very grateful.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> I get sex once a month... maybe.

<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> she is always accusing me of cheeting or web-camming with other woman.i am not, at all.

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> why you care who thinks bad about you?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> hey ther not a need to kick a** in fact u shld feel happy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> My Crazy 8 Magic Ball says, Definitely Not
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> If not, at least you are friends with some one you like.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Hay, why not ask a friend to ask him if he likes you?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> thats a good question one that really only you could answer.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> But most of the time it is.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> dat a person always has a person 4 him/her no matter wut?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Some, like maybe your sister does.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> men split in thay field to 2 group : 1- see the jealous as asign of love.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> which she does with the nurse.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Guys are bigger liers girls tell the biggest lies.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> If not, then you will know for sure.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> Your as sick as she is.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> Take it nice and easy Dont push to hard.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Well its totally up to you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> u stated in ur quessie that he tried to kiss you or sumthin.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> um i am confused as to why ur wife would want you to cheat!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Please check it out...you're life will change!!!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> of course yes it matters because for me longer is better, better to suck yeahh!!......uhh.uhh.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Otherwise, it always gets back to the guy and he is even more hurt.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> You have to know your guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> because of their complicated brain... they just don't think right most of the time.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> most cheerleaders (no offense at all) are stuk up, tho i have met ones that arent
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> til death do us part .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I wouldn't worry about it so much.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> but now be friends with him to see whats going on
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> carefully so you dont get hurt,  honestly so he knows he was asked out.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> u should wait to get married or even have sex so u can really kno k
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> If it doesn't we might regret it
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> He always ask me why do i like that guy or that guy.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> OR YOU COULD JUST WRITE HIM A LETTER AND HAVE SOMEONE ELSE GIVE IT TO HIM OR YOU CAN.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> just be careful what you wish for, you just might get
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Sorry, it just totally rubs me the wrong way!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> umm tell him that you know.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> it gets boring make it fun interesting.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> That is why, girls always cheat on boys.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> if she does, then you don't have to spend any more time thinking about her.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> maybe they cant figure which is betta.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> he is not in love with you he just wants someone to have on the side
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Guys are soo easy to turn on.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> What do people build there relationships on these days!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i don't think there is any set amount of time that is right for everyone.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> let him say i love you first.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> I do not know but I do not cheat on girls...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> cos ur husband is still attractive.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i totally agree with i know-pick me    This guy is a complete jerk and u probably r one too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> u do what u fell deep down inside.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> MY GIRLFRIEND SAYS WE DON'T TALK ENOUGH.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> A man probably doesn't have to lie to his guy friends.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> is it totally bad for me to envy them?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> (but i'm not 1 of them)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> i heard .. apples make them good in taste
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_25> I'd have to choke a b!tch
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> I think with..almost everything in life..you should not be rushed.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> i'll answer with a favorite quote...
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> You sound like a nice person.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> If I ever get married again, Vegas is the way to go.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> is it wrong for a woman to ask instead of the man?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> Got to be careful with that one.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> 5- How do you intend to get to him to tell him this?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> Well....*why* don't you want to have sex with him?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> sometimes, just dont over do it because then it becomes annoying, but otherwise yea!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> and then she gave me $20 back.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Its ok, ill go out with you  lol
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> dont do anything you dont want to do!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Just show her how to have a good time!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> actually i like it when my girl acted jealous.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> I kiss my husband whenever I feel Like it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> If you really love this person then marry this person.You will b very happy
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> just because she likes girls does not mean she wants you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> WHEN I GET IN MY BED I THINK OF SLEEP.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> if he cheats on his wife he can cheat on you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> love moves and works in mysterious ways...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> no means no, and waiting till you were crying was too long.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> DONT LET IT BECOME A ROUTINE!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> You could read some books if he's not willing to get some counseling to help both of you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> just come out wit it when he comes over to see u
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> STICK WITH HIM, EVENTUALLY YOU'LL STICK AS WELL.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> Anyway, I hope this doesn't sound too sick (it is your question after all) and answers your question.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> And he cant always hang out with us because he lives 15 minutes away!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Not at all.....as long as the chemistry is there age is just a number.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> You'll still young and you have a lot  going for you in life you know.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> unless there are other reasons why u 2 should get married.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> But I can't deal with lies.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> you know the little boats that are in italy.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> fuck the shit out of both of them, maybe even at the same time!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> its ur life enjoy it with ur way.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> It ruins relationships, lives, families--does he have any kids??
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> because men tend to make it out to be more then it really is!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> find a hobbie that you's can share.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> yes its cute to see them breake rules, but i mean get a life and get over it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I don't know about me yet but,my mom's friend got married to a black guy..
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> So I don't know if you should go that deep.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> Keep in mind I am REAALLLYY shy.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> hi i can be your friend mail me at harryblehnabladder@yahoo.com names sherly
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> and if he doesn't like you then it shouldn't matter.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Because if your just desperate for marriage then you can get anybody.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Skinny looking things don't do it for me.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> we broke up and i just want to be friends.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> If you are JJ then there is no way that kaylin likes you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> depends on how old you are, but you may just be late.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> my friends name is taylor and i have gon out with 2 boys whos names r jake and dalton.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> You better tell that B**** to back off.sorry for the word but if you like him fight for him
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> yeah,but do u think at the that time he really was thinking??????????
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> and if he feels the same way i feel about him, is it really love?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> what kind of question is this
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> she set me up with a nurse of hers.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> He doesn't just have a girlfriend, he has a WIFE!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Some people don't believe in marriage.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_20> THEY JUST DONT CARE NO MORE.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> 1.well how r u going to marry them if thier still in prison????
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> if he does you should talk to him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Now you should worry if your 50 years old and never been kissed.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> you are young and you have to find the right person.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> cause there idoits never trust them but if there yur parents or brother sure
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_25> Once a cheater always a cheater.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> the one who wasn't afraid to tell my parents where to shove it...LOL.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> I hope time will run its course and I catch the sex bug again.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> y is it dat nothng is as per our wishes???
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> If you don't love him, i don't think you'd care that much if he cheated on you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> And woundered why girls didn't like me.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Probably the same thing you want.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> (his way, or the highway) When I want to, he gets all mad most of the time.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Specially when I say I love you to her.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> Think of the things he'd like best!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> Just wait it out, if he likes you, he is going to eventually ask you out again...
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> My milkshake brings all the girls to the yard, and their like, it's better than yours...
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> #4: Is it worth getting back and why?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> And i don't think he ever will.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> just give him a peck every once in a while!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> be it 6000 miles like mine, or 6 miles.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> Nice guys are boring to women.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> because i couldnt see that with this person, she got her citizenship and then blew town.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> which my wife told me she would to make sure i was happy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> make it fun for her and you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> if it takes 20 years than so be it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> It is jerks like that that give good guys a bad name.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> It just stops all of a sudden!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> I know you are an old fashioned guy .
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> It always amazes me when I see women like this.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> at first they feel funny then it feels really comfortable!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> I didn't change my name back after I got divorced only because I am lazy like that!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> big women or small women, it shouldn't matter.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> umm... i guess it can both ways!!
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_40> he looks beond the snoby cheerleader.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Well I just took my girlfriend to see Memoirs of a Geisha.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> just because you have the hots for some guy doesnt mean you should start dating him.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> He has a plan for you!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> my brother loves this girl, whom i have met once.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> Hun if he keeps you a secret he ain't worth it in the long run.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Let him get off his lazy butt and go pick out a ring and plan ONE STINKING ROMANTIC night.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> I didn't really lose what I thought I had, because it never exisisted!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> don't think of something that doesn't exist.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_40> From my experience some men (not all!)
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> 1..hang out with your friend AND your boyfriend.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> Talk about having a full plate!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> #3: Do you really LOVE him?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> 2 weeeks shy of my 13th birthday.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> what does this all mean, does it mean he likes me?
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_10> YOU PROBABLY CAN'T BUT IF YOU LIKE HIMTHEN DON'T GO OVER THE HILL WITH TI
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Do something to her that you don't do to any other girl.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> if it was me i think i would tell her .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> you're just not sure if the other might freak out.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> I think for a person to cheat on another person, they can't honestly care too much.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_45> My hubby & I are 28.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Then its mean she LOVEs she  She loves you
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> you were his friend who is now with thier mom.so be carefull of what you ask for.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Why will he not let me go?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> u should appologize to him and tell him that u weren't serious and forgive him
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Odd, if he really didn't WANT you to see the text message.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> 18, my first semester of college
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> You can't keep stuff like that bottled in.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> Use them as if they were trash?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> 2 years, what a waste of time!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I do not believe in romance without legal marriage, even she also like to have a home.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> I WAS 22 WHEN  WE MET.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> patience and chastity....  i suspect that you gave him your heart and your body long ago.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Ask him what he's staring at
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> NEVER I REPEAT NEVER USE THE L WORD
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> ( if he knew how upset the initial blow was, he'd never talk!)
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> He is waiting until he gets married!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Why don't you just call him?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> If he cheats once...he will do it again.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> and who couldnt use another good friend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> mmm...sorry you need to be their for your wife and baby.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> No not unless you both want to
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> Is he a little playa playa?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> you to make yourself comfortable around him.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> Im not a guy but one time I did cry b/c it was my first multiple orgasm doggystyle.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> its good to smile shows ur confidence.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> Why he can't get none from his girl...  u think it sex..... then ask him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> do you really want to break up with your fiance?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> from there is where you should start trying new things to try and get you in the mood again.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Becuase of the guys you pick, not all guys are like that.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> Talk to his friends, get them to help him find you ;)
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> don't try to convince yourself that its a bad idea.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> just tell he/she that they are are annoying or if he/she starts getting annoying just tell him/her to chill
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> -^.^- ... it's the best way!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> You could always become a porn star... Lol.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> God CARES about each one of us, HE MADE YOU!!
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> 6 inch gage is sexy on a sexy guy
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_50> If he has a girl then move along.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> No I do not have a boyfriend, but however I do have a wife....lol
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> told ya dont act dont panic its nothing but hormone rush.enjoy it.be cool atleast u know u love him
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Try to find a good lookin guy with a big women, wont happen.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> cause ur stalkin or sweatin dem or just annoying.mayb
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Yeah I think u should but just as close friends at first.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> How about little love notes around the house?....maybe with his shaving kit?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> he is loving you too right?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> EVEN IF ITS FOR SELFISH REASONS TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF,YOU SHOULD NOT HOLD ON TO A GRUDGE.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> that usually means you asked the wrong guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> aw do not listen to those two.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> you have to stop loving him
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> yes.to my little cousin.but not to some1 special
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> tell them its over i dont want you your a dickhead
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> give every guy a chance...Im me at meow3994@yahoo.com  4 more info.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> I sat with her the the first day I saw her.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Get to know each other and hang out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> Sex....to women it means commitment....one nighters...are a slap in the face, basicly making her feel like a chaep whore!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> If you want a hoe, find a hoe.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> some guys dont kiss girls while doing it, but its the best when they are affectionate.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Like, If you could be any animal, what would it be and why?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> don't get me wrong i love them, dearly, and really truely happy for them.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> There are good guys out there you just haven't found the right one yet.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> Then tell about the code... Never date a friend's ex.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> Total slap in the face to a guy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> IT WILL AFFECT YOUR MENTAL HEALTH AND YOUR PHYSICAL HEALTH FOR MANY OR THE REST OF YOUR YEARS.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> Yea well thats what girls do!!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> she 3 years older then him
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> Get the hell out of there!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> queen, try not to take the chat rooms so seriously.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> And you can't keep it inside anymore.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> By the way dont care what your friend think they're not the one sleeping with him.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> I guess just be yourself & keep everything on a comfortable level!!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_25> And maybe the both of you can work things out.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_20> Think of what you're doing to them!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> i am agree with the girl at the last
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> If u post here does that make u between the age of 12 and 17 or gay?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> A breather if you could say.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I like you just as a friend
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Become the best friend she ever had.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> good luck n the relationship tho
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> he thinks we don't notice, but we do!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> a friend who was the daughter of one of my dad's friends was visiting.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> I don't want a divorce, but I want to be in love too.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> I bealive its because they are insecure with his or herself
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> It's hard on me and I love him.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_50> My kids are 5 and 3.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> well has she seen da ?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> dont have a friend ask him whatever you do b/c that could lead to more difficulties.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> once you go thong you dont go back.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> i beleive its OK for a woman to ask.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Yes, very much so for the first time!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> fart on her face a few times.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> nice question...my answer...go to a place where morality and insanity works hand-in-hand!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> i'm in similar boat as yours,but im against divorce.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Of course there is always love...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> I don't know yet, and i'm not planning to know for a little while longer :)
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> yes, and he never had a clue.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Maybe your girlfriend is just ugly XD
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> you an interogate him about anything and find out anything if he really does love you...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> It will ( if they get married) make their wedding night so much more special!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Just like girls, some cheat some don't.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> L=love I=is F=for E=ever If u spread love for everyone, u shall be remembered for ever.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> well, if you're willing to give up sex, then we'll take it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Why head over hills in love?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> I dont like using the phone that much.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> Say hi and try to get to know him a little bit.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> There are girls who like class clowns.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> needless to say i am devestated!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_45> im not sure who she is... r u tammy?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> i agree w/ everyone that anwered this is that it is 2 late!!!!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> if ur sweet then u would get sweetness in return!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> THAT IS THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD MAKE HIM SORRY FOR WHAT HE LOST....
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> I thought she was stupid AND ugly!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I asked this question once but maybe I need to explain myself further.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> wireless gamepads, wireless headphones, u know.. its cool to go wireless now...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> As much as they can get away with!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> if not, then i guess you either stare back, or simply ignore him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> you need to work on your spelling!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> Dump his ass and move on you don't need to be with a jerk like that.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> Get her drunk and make out with her.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> And always stress that it is who she is that you care for, not what she looks like!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> ok i have a boy friend and i like another guy.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> If she messed up then forgive her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> He always stares at me and throw stuff at me?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> I said I love you to my ex because I really love her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> I don't know what it is.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> THEN AFTER A SHORT WHILE HE WILL CHEAT ON YOU AGAIN....
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> i have been with my husband since we was 10 and 11 and we got married last year.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> find out why they accuse you that.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> Just say this: If you don't like me, just leave me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> trust me when i tell you he doesnt seem worth changing your future for
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I am just too old of a guy to be talking with a young girl of your age.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> smile, laugh, do whatever it is that you do to have fun!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i never realized how much i liked them until i wore regular panties again one day.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> I've got a good friend named Hannah.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> dunno about u, but if is good it makes me laugh, not cry...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i agree with all the people in here.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> !..F'in two chicks at the same time is just NASTY!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> It's crazy and fun and totally cool.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> honey if he loves you enough to wait then you have a much better chance of things working out
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Your married and your wife wants you to cheat and it's okay with you?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Class clowns DO NOT attract girls!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> No I haven't there but the best thing is to talk to an attorney...Best of Luck............
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> no, it just means you are smarter than a lot of other 18 year olds who aren't.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> woman are jelous of their frien true or false
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> well the respectful thing to do is not override your parents rules!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> A marriage is a holy thing that should not be poked fun of or mocked.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> i think that you should call her.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> we are talking but i dont know if he likes me i need help
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> maybe ask her out in a few weeks.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> talk to her about it, don't just ignore her!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> don't look for a relationship, let it find you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> check twice  ask  a guidence counsleor at school  this is just my oppion
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> But if you want an answer, girls get more pleasure coz guys love to please.

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> all the rest will follow soon.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> because of you guys thinking that they are cheap after they've done it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> i don't want to leave my husband becuase i have 3 kids.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> b/c they have no personality or they r jealous of u for some reason :)

<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> i have told him my feelings but he did not answer me.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> about 1-2 hours a day it depends on how much hw i have
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> He's not in his comfort zone, it's tuff!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> because if u dnt, u'll regret it 4ever.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> Hangs out with you when he has nothing to say.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> U do realize, that socialist doesn't mean ur social like a socialite.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> Doesn't that sound cool to say?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> would u ever want anyone to do that to you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> yes im 14 and yes im straight
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Doesn't anyone pbelieve in good old love?

<NbChars_70> <LevSim_10> I THINK ITS BETTER YOU FOR TO ASSES YOUR INTERESTS & THEN PUT MARKS IN FRONT
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> SIMPLY BECAUSE HAVING SEX ONLY IN THE BED CAN BECOME ROUTINE AND BORING.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> no,(and if someone says yes u are gay.no offense if u are.)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> I haven't told him though because Im used to guys my age (25) NOT wanting comittment.

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> and of course, he asks u on a date

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> my parents hate him and wont accept him because of his looks.

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> y cnt we love whoom we wanna lov??
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> A strong male hormone that prompts them to do things they'd never do if they didnt have it!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> guys are often scared to ask a girl out because if she says no it can hurt his pride.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> I would just beat his @$$.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> I've seen some beautiful women going out with men that I've said why to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Thong Panties...do I need to say more?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> It's great that she still revs my engine but I wanna rev her's too!

<NbChars_170> <LevSim_60> take the time to get to know ea.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> …and usually after you stop looking.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Love is not about sex, lust is.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> and if that dont work try swinggers partys there great.lol
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> he dribbles... he shoots... he scores... 2 points...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> As soon as you think you have them figured out... bam!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> now i feel weird if i am wearing anything besides a thong.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> shouldnt go out with him ever again... cant be trusted...
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> i never cheated, but could not handle constant accusations so i got rid of her.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> i would love to be, but at the momemnt,sadly,no.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> five yellow flowers are not meaning love my friend, five yellow flowers mean friendship...long lasting friendship..if you like.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> do u know it takes a 1000 muscles to frown?
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_55> None of them really, too old.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Is it ok to have a long distance boyfriend and hang out with other guys?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> just have fun and be honest with each other.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Thats is just tacky and off limits.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> they say love is blind .
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> In my experience, guys pretty much talk about marriage alot if they are interested.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> just keep friends, it makes life easier
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> she is your best friend just tell her nicely.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Romans 1: 24-32 LORD PLEASE DELIVER AND SAVE THIS GIRL.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> im gona have a great romantic dinner on the beaches of mexico and then well... you know.

<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> she just wanted a free ride she was a nurse also he even found her a good paying job.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> he dribbles... he shoots... he scores... 2 points...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Talk is cheap (until you go over your minutes)
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> He has his own thug style.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> its just a infatuation with something
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> !you can't trick persons to like you.it's the dumbest thing i've heard.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> what do u do if u like ur brother friend?
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_30> this isn't an answer but ouch!!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> he buys you a diamond when you ask him to.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> she was compleytely in love with me and i didnt wasnt that far yet,so it caused a little problem.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> well me personally, i like to do somthing fun, like playing pool, or bowling.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> I liked this girl, she took gifts from me, meals movies and such.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> depends on age ..strike up a casual conversation and see where it goes
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> You've been dating a guy for 5 yrs.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> ), and he also feels that u have forgiven him.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Gee - I don't know where it is...  (I'm convinced that is how it got its name)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> but be sure he'll tell about it all his friends.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> JUST THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY YOU WILL BE SAVING SOMEONES BODY FROM PAIN AND EMBARESSMENT.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_35> 8 (in some games) no score; nil.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> If she killed him and figures out you know she could kill you.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> to get more crap from you and then you dump him for the 2nd time, some GF you are
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> depending on how much he likes you, it can be pretty much impossible
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> that usually starts an interesting converstation
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Start flirting with the single guys u like and get to know them.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> mostwantedchick13 pm me on  yahoo we can chat about it.....Beaver  ...you can pm  me too
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> it is so hard to forgive people who are like that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> You guys literally don't talk enough because you're to busy with something else.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> If you don't like it, then why did you get with her in the first place?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> i dont no show me littlevada@yahoo
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> make something if your out of $$
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> WHAT DOES SHE LIKE ABOUT THE OTHER PERSON AND HOW SERIOUS IS SHE ABOUT HIM?.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> they are more complex than us girls, so it is harder to tell.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> well the answer is they want to have sex with you.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> and fot the other gilr who is also worry, pls do not.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> DUDE, Grow some nuts in your sack and man up!!!

<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> heads is yes.... tails is no
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_40> ask him is the best way
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> read books, or are you tossing the baby with the bath water.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> :)  I pay attention to a women's hands....nice hands, manicured nails, smooth skin, soft looking, feminine....like that.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_50> It beats faster when we look at the girl we love!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Say hi how are you doing.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> what do u feel about her?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> Oh man do I need help.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> you can try asking her first...just ask her flat out if she would like to?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> it depends which you think taste better ham sandwich or... and no not 14

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> =) good luck,  i hope he proposes!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> both of u must learn to trust each other.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> huh..not sure what you are asking
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Im still trying to figure it out myself
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> But we are already good friends so help...
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> Sex is overated anyways...you'll be like...o this is it lol!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> they think there pimps there not there just stupid and have nothing better to do
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> Once a while, she would be nice to me and i feel like in cloud 9.
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_30> But your mind tell you tell to stop!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> Tell him/her that u cant lie anymore..
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> go out with him n leave with someone else.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> If he is too big he cannot do anything but hurt a girl.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> invite your boyfriend over and ignore her
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> but it is something you should discuss.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Well....my husband and I just got married a little over a month ago and we have silly nicknames.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> I try to play the quiet type and do all most of my flirting with looks.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I once told a girl something similar.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> cool', some women can see through that!!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> Would he suck your big toe?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Well thats what my f*** buddy does!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> like when they say they want to hit that
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> dont do it think about aids
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> i couldnt be sure but she sounds like a nice friend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> very premature if you ask me
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> humm strange way of stating it aint it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_95> If he or she is not honest you don't want to be with them anyway.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> BUT YOU WILL ALWAYS LOVE HIM.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Guys cheat on girls cuz they think thier pimps.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> YOU HAVE SOMETHING BETTER FOR HER IN LIFE THAN THE LIFE SHE IS LIVING NOW!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> look in to your local laws though.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> come on you know do you realy have to ask?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> 6 affectionate greetings (give him my love).
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> you can get her  a necklace or something special.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> r u looking for an underage same-sex date?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> U MEAN WHY DO MEN DO THAT RIGHT?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> so if you want to find love you have to find friendship frist
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> OK, have you avtually met her or not?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Have fun.......and send me a postcard.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> Tell your boyfriend you just love how that guy is dressed.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> hey yall u just need 2 be coolwith it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> DON'T LOSE SUCH A BEAUTIFILL THING TO SOMEONE WHO MIGHT NOT EVEN CARE OR WANT YOU FOR LONG TERMS.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> THIS QUESTION IS TOO OPEN, YOU NEED TO NARROW IT DOWN.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> so i know what you're going through.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> I can't imagine that i'd like it but I've heard that some girls do.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> dont even think about it...personally, I could not manage it at all!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> ya very good idea thanks !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> as long as you don't beat yourself up about it u can still be friends
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> because you wont find no like that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> he still trys to avoid me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> yea i tried also but nah it didnt work.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> and bring some music to play you two will be kissing before you know it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> sometimes woman dont have very much self confidence and think their bf is cheating.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> We guys don't have much self-control.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> i would start waiting now, but your question doesn't make sense, it sounds like your already waiting...
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> TRy to push yourself to some guys that u like.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> He said he loved me back, but recently told me that he thinks hes gay, so now what?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> it does not bug me but i feel like she is just walking in my footsteps
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Just your grammer - start with the basics and work your way up from there :)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> before and most def while your period is on that is when i woman is mostly horney
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> maybe you both ned to grow up awhile before you try going out.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> statistically no, but miracles do happen.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> Punch, scratch,..Do what ever it takes, Let her know that he's yo man and you aint sharin!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_10> A WOMEN WHO JUST CAUGHT HER HUSBAND CHEATING MIGHT SEE A MARRIED MAN.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> ull know when he keeps looking at u and he talks or say hi to u
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> I say don't let her get to you.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> If shes bleeding after you finish do u think that she is enjoying herself?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and why men are always thinking about sex when they are with girl?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> 13 years and two kids later...
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_40> Wen u want to n you can..
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> it won't get better you know
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> and if he denies it slap him.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Most imprtantly: Be yourself and have fun!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> make eye contact, once you do, that smile... see if he smiles back.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> to the 1st girl above me i hope you do live in california!!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> If you have to ask your a brokeback Bit*h
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> love him just love.just feel each other.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> He becomes a primping mirror hog!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> even if they have girlfriends, they still watch and why do they hide it?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> maybe get a guy to come over
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> If u think your parents accept that...then u can continue.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> yes,i think any guy would want a valentine.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> Kind of an inside joke thing.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> so stick with waht you got.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> Penis Size and Satisfaction (A poll for women only!)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> I dnt want to think, coz its a sin .....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> You deserve a guy who will do the little things, don't you?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> There are many guys out who don't have a girl friend.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> When I have sex with my wife, it's great...too great.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> a lot of eye contact and smiling at you...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> well if you like him, then give him a smile.

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> How can i hang out with my friend without making my boyfriend jealous?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> I personaly do not date white men just not my type.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Just keep in mind most girls like guys who can be fun but also serious if it is needed.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> leave the room and go out.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> if he does, talk to him, what the worst that can happen...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> If she aint nasty, give it a go.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> she has to like or at least tolerate football, ha ha ha.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> BUT WHATEVER YOU DO PLEASE DO NOT NAG HER ABOUT IT IR INSULT HER!

<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> What ever you do dont be to cocky because it will slap you in the face.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Well, Hon...ya can't blame God for this one.He doesn't make anyone homosexual.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Because that is what they can get.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I didn't give her space, Too bad it took so long to learn it was me.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> Good Luck with you school and your life :)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_10> IT REDUCES GOOD RELATION BETWEEN U AND HIM.

<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> tell  me if you'r in love if so give me a love story
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> im kinda short on cash so try to be frugal
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> dont think im crazy, its just what i think and believe
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> 20 years is a heck of a big gap... You're old enough to be her grandpa almost.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Ask her whjy she wants you to cheat?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> wait for him tto come to u u'll know he's the 1
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> if not, tips would be helpful(i do know some hot girls already).
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_10> YOU SHOULD ASK HIM IF HE LIKES YOU.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> if you are communicating, you should know!!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> when  you want  to  spend  most  of your time with   this person.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> im fifteen and he is sixteen he works and were in love what should we do
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> id love to get spanked, but not to hard, just enough to turn me on
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> and what i thing now is.... loving each other, i mean boys and girls, are embrasse.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> Did you ever think - maybe she likes it that way?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Its like, they love cheese cake, but they only want a slice of it.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> is this guy ugly cuz if he is then maybe you shld stay away from him
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> And then take it very slowly...protect your heart and dont think about a future with the guy.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> I don't know try some pepto Bismal
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Or don't do it at all.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> to hav sum1 is important in life n wen dat sum1 kisses u, u feel ur complete.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> if no luck try the rest stop
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> but i am only in seventh grade.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> you take birth control pills when you have sex all the time &don't want to get pregnant.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> i give straight aswers.. go ahead and ask :-P
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> just her wonderful self personality and all
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> why is it i can never find the right guy close to home?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> IF THAT'S WHAT HE LIKES LET HIM BE.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> i haven't ever had a girlfriend.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> Where can you get the dish from ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN DOING THIS WHY SHOULD IT MATTER WHAT ANYONE THINKS.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> well... im not looking for sex but you can get sex through commitment and thats what im looking for.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> if you feel like doing it .. then do it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> The more honest you are makes it a bit easier
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i think so.if you dated a girl
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> This is easy...just tell her you don't have feelings for her anymore.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> we think that tough guys are more popular and they look alot better.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> this statement is niether wrong nor right !.....
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> my bf is a really sweet and kind guy.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> I don't see why not, you never know she might like you too!
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_40> But not as bad as losing virginity to a hooker.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> so one doesn't bother to ask lovey-dovey questions.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> make him happy and you'll be happy too.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> just think about how his wife would feel if she found out!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> Preferbally madden 06 depends on what the guy is like
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_25> or is it just not usual?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> Oh boy, I don't know what to tell you to do but, good luck anyway.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> If he loses interest for you being urself, then you guys weren't mean to be/
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> and figure out what we ant for our self first.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Isnt that enuf indication that he also likes u?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> BUT EVERYTIME I SAW A WOMAN I GOT TURNED ON...IT WAS JUST A PHASE..I LIKE ALL MEATS EXCEPT FISH..LOL
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> What Cronides just said - Awesome answer!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> Not one man and two women.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> Oh, wait, what were you asking again?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> it might not b so normal as u think
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> You don't have a FRIENDSHIP to lose with him!?!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> aren't you a man... boy whats wrong with you?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> guys don't really dig needy girls esp.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If he said he never had sex with his wife, believe him.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Or else he loves being around you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Making love is having sex with someone you care about deeply.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Im so tired of men who dont act grown up.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> first you have to say the word fuck not copulate
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Try speaking proper english without all that stupid ghetto slang..get a job...take care of yourself..get a car....and look hot...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> i prefer on the phone  because you cant get hit that way.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> If u don't know what one is then you haven't had one and you will know when you have!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> according to what state shes in.be freinds wait till she 18
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Dating isn't really too hard ... rejection is ... but don't take it personally.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> if you don't like her then tell her  it the right  thing to do ;(
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> stab him you are your own person
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> yeah u will wonder but its true.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> sexiest piece of clothing on the planet lol.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> So to youI must say two words.....TOUGH LOVE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> a lot of practice and a little mono.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> there is nothing you can do .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> so first off take a step back and think about how long you will be married to this guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> hey you can't change someone that doesn't want to change.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> if they do enough things then you wont be in love with them anymore.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> just like with all men they have some that are sweet and some that are jacka**es .
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> It should not be a big deal to him...
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> It's time to walk the (married!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> if he talks back and trys to flirt with you, than you know hes probably talking to other people.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Make it perfectly clear to him that they are friends, and that's it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> I guess I was kind of off that night.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> Chances are she has heard it b4 too.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> thats just how they are :( its a shame lol
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> But he is getting married this month.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> Why don't women just say they like us?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> but be safe watch out for the shady boys.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> As time goes, She said to me It was good that she didn't ask.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> it is not neccessary that he like u but always decide that what your heart says to u
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> and i get all mushy feeling inside everytime he calls me that.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> hunnie looks like your stunk between and rock and a hard place .
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> A walk in the park (it is so cold, most people will stay home).
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> If I'm not in that place in my life, then 'NO FRIGGING WAY!!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> cause they get bored or find something even better
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> sure they can.. and its great if u can jus stay dat way...
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> first timers beware of the walls and closets they hurt.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> if they look at you, they probably like you!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> a woman has something called an egg.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Here's some good things for you and I hope they help.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> try different positions..role play do some crazy stuff
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> I am totally straight just have a thing for the feel and look.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> AND THE BEST ONE YET: Who's that?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> My mom's birthday is coming up.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> he could just be trying to give you space.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_50> Btw im in college and im 19.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> tell me why come on chop chop quick quick snell
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> just see if he's at all interested.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_30> give it time and get over the guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> is your question how do you make them arroused?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Look...You don't have to have a boyfriend yet to have fun with life.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> You just seem like a jerk at that point.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> yes new girlfriend 2. she's got 2 yrs.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> she has to be a 7.5-9.5.  unless i REALLY like her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> your parents dont like your boyfriend well they probably have a reason.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> We BOTH AGREED ON THAT SHE WOULDNT SEE or HANG OUT WITH HER FRIENDS UNTIL MARCH 1.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> u never know who they really are.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> i did this recently and it was THE BEST EVER!!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> Hey, try not to worry about it too much.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> usually at school, that's how i found my ex!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> If he does that makes things easier.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> Yes, and even more if they are beautiful on top of it....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Turn them face down - Oh and pull there hair and a little smack on the bottom couldn't hurt!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> what are some qualities that girls see first in guys?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> if you suspect, most likely he does.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> anybody can be totally hot but yet be a big loser!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> honestly id have to say and it may sound bad but let it ride out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> No matter where you go belive me u will see a sexy sexy man
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE I CAN HELP WITH??
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> sugar in gas tank or glue his dick to his stomach with super-glue
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Ask him if you  can be friends.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> it's not really worth it wait until you are much older that's just advice from a dad.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> good luck trying to pull that off.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> what you need to do is hire an att.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> I say, that if you love her then there is nothing at all wrong with it.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> not inless you are 21 even then dad always knows whats best
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> The list goes on and on...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Oh that's my cousin and her nickname is Her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> I mean u r really into him!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> i like to make friend with her
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> First some questions for you:  1.How old are you?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> Ask him....then you can move to the next guy or next level
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> If not it is pretty unreasonable for you to ask her not to drink.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> or maybe a massage to calm her nerves then fuck the hell out of her!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> If you have to ask then you are not in love.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> i am joshua, based in nigeria.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_80> I married when I was 22 and I am happy that I did.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Thats up to you, if you want to the do it, if not don't.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> (I'm one of 'em and I can say that it's fun!)
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> Think of yourself, don't you have any good/close friends that are girls or vice-versa ??
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> That just cracks me up... thanks man, I needed that.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_20> im a great kisser says my bf haha
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> go to africa, be nice, be rich and buy one.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> she told me how regretful she was and how much she loved and missed me?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> there must be evidence if u want divorce.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> And you get half of everything he has!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> then any time you think about him and start to like him again, REMEMBER THOSE THINGS.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> If she has been responsible with it, I don't see why not.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> i don't know what to say in this box  bye
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> get over it he dont love you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> laugh at his dumb jokes if hes a class clown.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> but you will most likely remember this girl for the rest of your life.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> excitement... fantasy.... but it's all nonsense, truth is he's bored...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> if it attention ya want and hes not giving it then you need to bee getting a new man
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> she's still young and still has time.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> what did it for me was i found the guy she waas dating and i kicked his a$$.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> a place where naked women dance for ...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> he met her in an internet site.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> You wouldn't want him to die before your kids go off to college!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> My boyfriend just broke up with me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> And to forget about ever being with him...PERIOD!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Got it wrong...that's an understatement of the year...YOU ARE HOT 'N SPICY...MMMMM!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> But beleive me you are young and not all guys do things like this.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> just watever u do, don't brag to your friend, it always ends in ditching.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> give him the time of his life
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> she used protection and shes tested.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> try it honey, who knows she is just waitting for u..there no wrong in trying..GO FOR IT...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> I like this guy, i'm going 2 call him Joe.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> if u like dat person so much then dun fuckin care wat people say.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> ok so I just enrolled in this new high school and im sort of shy there.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Hon, aren't you a tad young to be getting married?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> Many will tell you it's no big deal...because they already gave theirs away.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> I think she pretty much summed it up right there!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> the only reason u would not have sex with her is because u would get fired???
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> First of all, are you a guy or girl??
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> look your best and go out in the world.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> you might, and you might not.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> then they will come to you.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> what are some ways to spice up my relationship and make it irresistable
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> force hiim to have crazy sex and show him what you got.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> IF YOU TRY TO RUSH HIM THE YOU MAY PUSH HIM AWAY SO BE CARFUL.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> or do ur own detective work, or hire a detective.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Although the older ladies dont mind if u tell them that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> And my parents really didn't like that!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> no one's young or old enough to be in love..but honey, you are too young to be married..believe me!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> the wife unless you really have some stuff or unless she is not contesting the divorce.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> hes a year older than me
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> not sure but it may be 18
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> no matter what she will ether find out or she will just see it in your eyes.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> if your friend was a real friend she should understand
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> if nothings downloaded it's probably her realizing that fart stinks.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> He seems like he's a bit disturbed...run like hell
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> but y r u trying to change who someone is that isnt you place to do so
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> And the best thing a husband expects from his wife is that she never do shopping..hahahahhha:))
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> plant in a plant holder that he likes...say a car or a beer can...just kidding.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Guys do it too, so its definately not limited to women!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> tell him to close his eyes and describe you!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> what was a really cool way you met someone special?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Ask him do he love you or that Gold Digger.Tell your neice that .
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> and in d end just say hope to see u again.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_10> NO!IT'S NOT HEALTHY FOR A RELATIONSHIP,THE FOUNDATION WILL SOONER OR LATER CRUMBLE AND WITTER AWAY.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> no its not bad as long as its not your mom or dad
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> If not, you might be too young.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> just be careful about the men u choose.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> i was 13 and it was the wort date of my life..
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> You think you loved him once, why?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Just don't over do it or you might scare him away.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Or I suppose you could pay like 200rs in front of palakha :P
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Except of course, if u only want to marry them to enhance your .....
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_20> Then throw him one... WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ME HAVING A BOYFRIEND?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> and a walk in the park.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> he said we clicked so well and blah blah blah.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> (I've tried telling them, but they just get pissed off at me!)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> and then...how long after the first date to going out?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> I used to stare at her a lot and she'd occasionally catch me (im shy).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> months have gone by, if you dont want a fire to go out, you need to feed it.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> but he is not there yet, he's not ready for a full commitment yet.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> No matter what anybody tells u here.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> I like lips on a girl.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> Nope your gonna have to do some serious soul searching.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Tell her she needs to give it a few good years.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Say: I care about my boyfriend.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> at all costs, avoid self-help books!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> And everyone is trying to tell me what to do, and I hate it.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> It seems as if all the good ones are either taken or I just can't find one.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> I think we all have those days, hang in there, and don't let the bad days get you down!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> i do hope ladies with that mindset won't lose hope.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Tell him, Thank you for the concern, but DONT TELL ME WHAT TO DO!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> dont be afraid express to him how u really feel
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> do u wanna be with him, tell him their guy friends, he doesnt have control over you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> look her right in the eye and tell her how you feel.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> might as well just flash them a couple bucks and tell them how they can earn it!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> girls kick guys in the balls to outright hurt them.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> Is it in their name, or his?
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_35> how do they do it..do they do it the way we do..watch our ass leave?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> so just be yourelf, have great confidence in you.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_20> Hey, I'm a boring family guy... what did you expect?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> they are the sweetest men i have ever met.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> If he is cheating on you then dump him.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> just flirt with her and she'll catch on
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> but if he does notice then say to him that the way you feel about him and pool.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Jessica Alba - i like that actress ;) But i would never cheat on the girl i love.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> The thing that cares more is that ure gonna be hapy with that guy
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Cuz I can see myself in them.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> DUMP HIM AND DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Girls can chase me al they want lol
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> hope it goes great for you!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> God was up there smoking on tha blunt while creating them....god forgive me...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> You ask her to do things that are not reasonable, then you get mad when she doesn't do them.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> No way man, not at all.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> ( i know my mom died )
<NbChars_260> <LevSim_25> Best not to drag it out and lead her on.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Yes, don't let anyone hold you hostage like that.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> And if hes a rage aholic ur in bigger trouble.

<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> Just not seeing other people or something more?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> u are on the wrong category this is love and romance not the nature channel.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_30> Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> So, if we get a little crazy now and then...just remember...chocolate is a girl's best friend!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> lower down your gaze and guard your modesty.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> its not all its cracked up to be.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> good bye oh and god bless.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_45> Sex w/ my girlfriend is the best.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> Does he LOVE you enough to STAY?

<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> dun care them,jus show out ur beauty 2 them
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> no i don't know what you mean.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> I just had to get to KNOW him before I admitted it to myself.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> but If I could I would 2-3 x a day
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> How do I find her now?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> should i go out with here and be with her?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> he will persue you not the other way around
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> Second of all, ONLY seven?...dude, that ain't a whole hell of a lot...not anymore.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> OMG how many times will this question be asked?!?!?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> Once a cheater, always a cheater.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> wow your dumb, talk to him
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> Whe u tell a woman u love her, she gets weird.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Don't ask him, though, for a list of things to do.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> People in my life, that I don't see much, that have gone on, I can forget they are gone.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> go outside in your underware saying i'm gay.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Maybe they were just pop-up ads or something similar.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> she is clean but she is been with 7 guys.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_50> It used to be a guy thing.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> go ith what your heart tells you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> Do you like chocolate or something?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> im single, available and very much negotiable
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> idk... i've got a general idea, i just wanna know what you guys know
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> Get her seeing other people...friends, family, going on dates if ready for that.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> she can't possibly be a 4 tho because women are beautiful people.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> i have been participating in cultural interaction and now i want it in my marriage.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Obviously you have strong feelings for this man !!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> I am friends with his g/f.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> WHY SHOULD I ANSWER A QUESTION THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY ANSWERED YOURSELF IN THE QUESTION?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> because u to good to be true
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> hang out with his friends that way he gets too know you better
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> make some thermite, and use it on the hood of a car
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> I(I'm a redhead and he is 2, by the way) Please help me...
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> I personally like Ash idea though.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> To h*ll with that..tell him what you are GOING to do..don't ask.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> And then tell the first person I knew.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> If that doesn't work in a month or two, then leave him, hes not worth it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> why are you going ouy with her if you dont already like her??
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> Once a cheater always a cheater!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Get him drunk and ask him straight out...most guys can't remember saying embarassing things when they sober up
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Always do what your parents tell you!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> she should be good manner so many of way
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_30> then try to find a girlfriend who dont have a boy friend
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> if your not too serious then get him somthing he would like.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> but i have learnded why i am devoriced.. why men do not like my life style.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> If you like her and she likes you then of course go out with her.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> anyway, back to the issue at hand, just prepare yourself... for anything ...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> baby girl move on there are two many men out there for you to be worried with him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Just keep doing what you are doing.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> money is not worth all of the bull shi*
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> and everyone else (except the 2 comments abouve mine) are right.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE A MISTAKE
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> It doesn't mean i don't love vanilla.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Talk to him see if there are any same interest.Say hi, flirt & stare at him alot.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> get them jumped and called them a dick head
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> (And men are just big kids.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> It's all fake just like Vegas.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> and the bst way to a womans heart is with red roses
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> if you waht to get friends, then go out and keep trying.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> B wants me to be his girl but he is taking it slow.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> there is a girl out there for you don't look and enjoy life and that someone will come around!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> it depends if u hv a very hairy butt then wax....but otherwise no...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> SOMETIMES I WISH I COULD SLAP THOSE FLIPPIN' B*TCHES!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> You don't want anyone ugly either.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> so the rest are still friends..isnt it?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Good luck with everything and God bless!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> stomach all the way a nice flat stomach, not with huge abs or anything.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> it says: 恭喜發財  just kidding   I don't know
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> its been twelve years since ive seen him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> how can a guy tell if a girl is checking him out?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> What ever they were write them down.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> Utter betrayal, then she woke up!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> then a month later the cops where going to get involve then she final told me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> What, it happens to guys, too!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> i dont like sweetie that much, or muffin, or pumpkin.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> if she really loved you she would forgive you but not forget.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_30> Playas and Thugs go hand in hand.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> Thing is... Boyfriends especially young ones don't always have your best interests at heart.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> I mean I know the difference looks wise but who cares really, ya know what I mean.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> yah, u can IM me on luapro77
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> testing if anyone else loves me as much
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> IF YOU KNOW HE'S CHEATING WHY ARE YOU GOING TO SPICE THINGS UP?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> I mean, two mice at once, wow!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> hope you find your answer soon:)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> 1: i think she likes me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> now you realize how much you like men..
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> But i thought I had your heart?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> You don't need to get married.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> just remember one thing, no one is the same.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> you have plenty of time .
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> Everytime my friend litkes someone she goes crazy, even when they don't like her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Just say it seems like he liked you and that you were just wondering because you like him....so on.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> I'm 40 and my girlfriend asks me all the time, Why aren't you married yet?.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_70> i have a friend who is 23 and still a virgin.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> stand for him...& if u through with each other like bad breaking up or something,u can mock that nose!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> THE OTHER SITES WERE A BIT SLOW AND LAME.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> If u only knew her a short time and cheated on her..don`t think she will forgive u.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> If he dosn't do anything then live him, No guy should treat any girl that way.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> My opinion...no one is ever good enough for her baby!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i think its their greatest asset.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> if not Kings will never married
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Just the thought of a Brazillian wax scares me!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> i understand your pain (my grandma died when i was 6) but you shouldn't lie about it!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> Idk if you'll get that but yeah.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I don't know it's just not a good color.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> DONT EVER LIMIT YOUR SUCCESS OR HAPPINESS TO THE PAST OR EVEN THE PRESENT.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> GIVE HER THIS LINK AND LET HER READ IT.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> try them in a really serious situations... such as in death, disease, poor .. stuff like that
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> dude, before you know it you will have another girlfriend and no longer be a virgin.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_40> Tell him to get a life.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> hey you could just come up and say it!or you could hold hands and say it slowly
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> For most men.....Take your shirt off.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> It would never work on me, but it is so cheezy you have to laugh
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Im not alone on this planet!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> YOU ARE THE HEAD AND NOT THE TALE.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> Mostly i dnt look coz im blind !!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Go to Barnes and Noble they have some great books on that subject...K
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> french kissing but don't go for the world record
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> And it you do look like you're trying to pick up a guy then fine!
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_30> 13 is too young to have a boyfriend.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> Set it and DO NOT touch it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> no, you cant always help what you dream about so dont worry about it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Its like cuddeling and all that shit.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> because you're the best a man can get.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Get a backbone and send that foriegn guy packing.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Also she doesnt really like fancy stuff like perfumes, lipsticks.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> i will try to talk to her and ask to be her friend
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> a party, invite a bunch of his and ur friends*that is if he moved from there*
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> why do you want him back?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Trust me, he won't think your a hoe.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> Would he quit playing sports just because you told him not to do it??
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> Pick up the mattress and roll his lazy can off.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> if it is ment to be it will be.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> yes but youll never find them
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> i'm a virgin because i don't want to be a statistic or stereotype and i don't give into temptation
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Not really, who are you anyway?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> i read this on the internet, it could work for either gender.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> good luck/ and have fun with it, most important be creative.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> I donno, maybe my girl is cheating me?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> ya it means he likes you cause i have done that myself
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Becasue i think he accidently got a new gal friend
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_25> in the mouth (exspecailly long tongue kisses)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> youll get married without even thinking about it.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_50> OR, go get a job and a girlfriend.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> not if you nice and unjugemental as you would like others to be about you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> girls aren't all about looks like we are so u should be fine.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> it just gets easyer to tollerate it .
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_50> Red hair also look... kinda funky and...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Do NOT give up your friends - ANY of them, male or female - for some GUY.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Ask him if he'd like to go somewhere fun together.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> i dont live in kuwait but i can be one
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_40> Go see a movie or just go out.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_25> Get to know her a little.
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_25> if not, you are not his first priority.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> i fall head over heels and turn to mush.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> strict grandma and gotta listen to her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> just give her some space and see how things go from there.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> You'll find an even hotter guy who wants to be with you!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> TELL YOUR NEICE TO ASK THE GUY IF HIM AND THAT GIRL STILL HAVE ANY SORT OF RELATIONSHIP GOING.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> Nope, it dont really hurt them a bit...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Ummmmmmm,I take it you need to get laid or something.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> That'll catch the heart of any latino guy I know.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> i loved our invites and the price!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> money is not important in life .
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> you learned what your mother told you.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_25> Shoud i play hard to get?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_10> IF U ANSWER THAT QUESTION YOU WILL KNOW
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> I love him him and people in love don't cheat well that's what I think.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Oh,and in the pelvic area ;)
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> And when you've done that, THEN you decide if he has changed and if you want him back.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> im a guy, so i know.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> just be your self and don't stress
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> You say: Hey Hun, your best friend is a sl*ut.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> unless you guys were seperated and it didn't end on a true fault..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> I didn't know why I didn't recognize her!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> GOD'S MERCIES ARE NEW EVERY MORNING.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> how the hell can i know why ur sad?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> you do everthing he wants you to do.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Why doesnt any girl want to hook up with me?Where did i go wrong?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> make sure yur not being ME ME ME!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> I DON'T AGREE MY BEST FRIEND FOR ALMOST 6YRS.

<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> i would love it and if you give me a call my no is 09871985706
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Maybe hes just not into you anymore.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_20> Guess I am a little bit of an exhibitionist :)
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> u could always kiss him that will get his attion
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> i would definately go with the idea of using a different season, so atleast 12weeks.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> sex is a way to tell someone loves you or not

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> girl why dont u give them a try.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> In my opinion....she either really likes you, or she is 'playing you'.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Guys are easy to figure out.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_40> only if u think it is but its not
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> especially if he is shy and try's to hang out.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> Depends on what ur boy friend likes.

<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> Well, it's important to love your parents.... but if you tongue 'em... that's just freaky!

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> is she in general a hag ?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> or find somthing new to do like sking and talk about it when you have a chance.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> ask your friend if you could back off fight back
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> i think you should do some detective work... but make sure not to get caught...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> She lived next to a zoo!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Uh-huh...well, we've been married for over 5 yrs.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Build them up, give them a big head basically.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> That only leads to pain for the both of you.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> well I personally don't have a problem rubbing my wifes feet.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> I had one mouse in my mouth (that was still biting me) and I had the other pinned.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> and any way that's not poison ivy that u have thats crabs.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> coz i know that inside is better than outside
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> Well....she Obviously likes it both ways   but Truly Loves her man.....!!!!!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> :im 16, and live in Kansas City,MO.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> take your time to know him well
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Just don't play him unless he plays you because both sexes do that.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> ask him if you could hang out at break or lunch or something.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> It is perfectly okay for a girl to like to have sex!!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> Isn't that why people get married?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Go up to her and say hello!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> i eat it every day(i did).
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> just be yourself, dont try to cover it up.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> divorce - bad sex is bad marriage
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Life to short for dump stuff like that.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> Meanwhile he doesn't mind friends hitting on me!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> yes because u'll have to face it sooner or later .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> HOWEVER----i find him looking at me every now and then.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> she says she loves me,what do i do
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Dont ever give in to temptation.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Just keep your head up sweetie.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> dont just say it unless he`s asking something of you that you know is wrong.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> but, that is not what i use to decide whether i like her.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> be youre self always if that's no good enough then he wasn't the right man for you
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> are u asking for fatal attraction to happen.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> DO you like me or do you just want to be friends?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> he doesnt mind his lady is being hit on!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> All you half to do is say quit bugging me about it!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> most hearts you see are red.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> just tell him you like him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I started chasing it and had it pinned!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> KEEP IN MIND NO ONE KNOWS THAT I AM GAY.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> And it depends on like does she flirt with you and if so how?
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_10> HOW DID YOU GET IT AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH IM SCARED!!

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> you can go back begging .
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> any dreams and desire (that doesn't include getting married and pumping out xerox copies of yourself).
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> She's been tested and pasted all clean and clear...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> They can be sexy if they are nice and full
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> girl i am feeling you on  that because my man do the same thing.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> OMG, I would gasp, probaly shreek, & then polity tell him to put it awy where it properly belongs.

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Think about this... aren't men and women biult to conquer eachother?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> and i was wondering could this be bad like they dont like me or is this a good situation.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> a friend can last a lifetime a guy can come and go.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Now, stop doubting your looks and feel as cute as you wanna be!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> i need some advice to get him back
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> he also said he still really likes me and he just shouldn't have started it in the begining.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> Grab it All out at once and place it somewhere else, like at another bank!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> but it always comes up in the friendship once in a while...I am in love with ( her/him).
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> of coarse they are havent you ever seen a man looking at a victoria secrets cataloge and drooling
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> he can't help you if you don't give it to him.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> there are a lot, and i mean a lot!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> darling u are just 16... if i were ur parents i also FORBID u to marry.

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> so what if he doesn't want to go out with you?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> this happened to me a while back, and i am once again on the dating scene.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> yea, its really messy down there though.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Lately, I've realized that I care for him...ALOT.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> ehmmm ...first try to find a japanese girl if you can...  :DD
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> why is it so hard to talk to girls???
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> Because if its love then who cares about how old you are.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> well you got to tell her that its your guy not hers.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> if u wanna go out with him, go out with him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> To me people that do that have self esteem issues.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> well how long did u date this girl?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Or, you start having a crush on them as well, because they actually are pretty handsome, nice, etc.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> i as a woman would much rather be the one to hold the whip :)
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> By the way Im 21. pabsicool@yahoo.com
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> I'm a Lady, and Baby you better not ever forget it because i don't give second chances.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> I was a vigin til I was 19 and believe it or not..some girls like that.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> U can't make anybody do anything,u could only give them reasons to,then it's up to them.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> Dont make it a line or nothing!!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_80> hope you find what your looking for.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> Do what you normally do .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> I don't want my friend to get repeatatly rejected!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Dude, have confidence and chicks will dig that.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> do you not have anything better to do
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> Because many man nowadays is just playing around.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> he may be cheating or you dont turn him on anymore
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> i, at least tries to be.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Or am I just being greedy?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> You don't care enough about him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> You make me giggle...tee hee tee hee...so much cuter than that silly hamster.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> if youre not happy with this person, tell him if he cant stay with you, youre through.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ME AND YOU TOGETHER?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> your mom would be delightened just tell her he's courting you...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> If your talking about a husband or boyfriend there is a million other ways
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> With me it was worse I used to like men that were married.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> My suggestion: Give it a shot.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_20> Or in other words: HELL YES!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> GIRL YOU SHOULDN'T RUSH THINGS LIKE THAT.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Ten Grand could get someone killed.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> hang around him but don't be too cklicky
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> it should not be that way.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Then an only then will you know why they stare at u so much.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> well girl, you need to let her find out for her self.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> Nope but I live in OKC.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I think it will be handful for me!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> dont do that he will always be near never forget him u just hav to accept hes gone
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> is it strange emails or text messages your finding?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> what else can you do if yes?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> Don't go overboard and freak her out.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> If you like yourself forget what any one else says.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> but i think a cute gift would be a hamster!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> now y ou see my younger brother is gay and he is mad cool.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> no it more like not beening trueful to your boyfriend
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> sorry i couldn't be more help.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Don't worry about the grrrs, they LOVE us bad boys.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> especially a goatee looks so incredibly sexy on a guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> i agree friends can become lovers, but with how many of them?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> and if a girl ask just be honest about it.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> Dump him and come to me
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> set him strait before things get serious
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> I mean and i think...he pulled me back from teh worst situation i had ever been through.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Women like bodies just as much as guys do.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Tell her to be more serious about it he not worth fighting over.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> depends when you hookup is it for sex?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> they treat chics how they wanna be treated.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> How come most girls dont like guys with red hair?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> I trust her 100% and i want her to know that.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> depends on the guy , and his likes/dislikes.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> Should I give him / us that chance?
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> Of course, I'm more of a butt man anyway.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> You have to just tell her.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> Like, Baby, I understand, I am sorry, Things will be ok...etc.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> chase him or her  aur investication that's it or give love and ask
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> Most of us are pretty easy like that!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> dump his ass, you deserve better
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> When a girl likes u she is usually shy, and u can see her looking at u alot.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> I am not too sure what it is you are asking...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> you are out of order fancying ur mates boyfriend
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> And he sounds like a control freak.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> ~Margaret Smith   Don't knock masturbation - it's sex with someone I love.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> well u no guys if they could prob.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> are you being an april fool.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> She thinks it's fun to see if she can get them.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> but i'm nervous and don't know if i should.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> a baby sitter if they have kids, or a nice hotel room rental
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> its so much fun and besides, who just wants a plain old kiss?!?!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> gross thats almost like u and ur cousin having sex if them two already did Grosss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> for example a shirt or sweat shirt
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Wouldn't you want the same thing if your husband cheated on you??
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> and see how you feel, time will tell
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> But do not try to break them up, or she will not like you and he certainly will not.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> We deal with men, u got to deal with us!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> other fish in the sea.... move on he's not the only guy on earth.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Don't worry though, mine is horrible too.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> And DON'T eat too much ice cream.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_80> Ask him and save him the trouble
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> if sumthin good happens then i guess sumthin good happens.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> this woman sounds like a homewrecking predator
<NbChars_325> <LevSim_25> I need to hide my car.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> we only share 3 children and nothing else.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> In my opinion I do not think it's OK to be gay.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> Either one will get you in deep crap.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> im in the same situation w/ more time from the brake up.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> I'm like a 8.5 so i wouldn't.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> you don't, he is the one making the move first
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> he asked me if we had any peanuts to eat.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> u just avoide hem  and he well come to u
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> aND COULD WE PLEASE STOP WITH THIS    MEN CHEAT, .
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> *UPDATED*  I can't solve your problem.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> be your self and if thats no good he wasnt the right man for you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> I'm a libra too... falling in love is like breathing for us ;)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> This one I know, but I don't really.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> ho yourself up and rock his world and he'll forget the other girl!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> he keeps telling me that he loves but Im afraid that he wont wait till I go back!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> well how old or you if you still live with them then no loves not forever but family is
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Read the words......'now I want you here with me from tonight until the end of time'.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> I feel like I don't have a social life anymore.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> I hope this helps, God bless you!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> thats way better than some stupid line most women even dont like.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> Why would he do this if he has nothing to hide?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> I shouldn't count cus I'm a guy, AND DONT GET ME WRONG IM STRAIGHT!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> dont do notthing just let god do his job.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Just ask him, there's no point waiting.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> make it a pair to be more romantic!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> hey don't jump to nothing to quick.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> People really don't think all that mean stuff you think they think.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> At the Judgement Day , for sure!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> and just like others have said, there are others out there, and you will find someone else!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> i wish i knew so when u find out please let me no
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> not all people like him its ok if you just be yourself!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> i definately cant stand a lot of boys that like me.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> Hmmm, doesn't one lead to the other?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> Me personaly I think if you catch them in the act then they gotta go.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> seeing he has been trying to get me to date him again???
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> I feel for you ... this is a really hard one.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> he doesn't know what he's issing.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> that is the question.......... well ask him if he means going as friends or as in a date.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Both of them, It really not depends on gender, but on each person
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> that's exactly why guys can't just squeeze girls' boobs because they'll sure like it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Too Big: her love for her hubby Too Small: her tolerance of his ignorance
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> It sounds stupid, but it got me out of trouble once!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> Have you tried to kiss her?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> i think he has some qualities of a pig!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> But get out there, show the women you are available and what a great guy you are!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> u don't need to date too young
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> i did that once-it feels awesome and acomplishing
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> he couldnt hide that from you for that long.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> PARETICULARLY IF IT IS GOING TO BE A LARGE WEDDING.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> What girls have  to learn to do is ask questions without asking.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> coz i feel i need her, and i feel i wanna keep her with me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Dont be sorry for being young juss tell them yu aint into old women $!#%&*()!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Or post your pic on amihotornot.com...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> i am not married yet peaple
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> be there for him if he needs advice or someone to talk to.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> a cant read stars....find another way to say it
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> Bra & panty which r not covering anything.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> kinda like intense pain being relieved.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> Im 20, a girl and a virgin.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> IS A GUY,AND MOST OF MY OTHER FRIENDS ARE GUYS
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> men and women are somewhat similar.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> The first time you betray a man (or woman!)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Don't say to get back up on the horse, please.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Don't you hate it when people ask questions with questions?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> you should look at around you first.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> hey, ive been going through something similar to your situation.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Likely, you have guy friends who just that, friends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i love him but does he love mo?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> you have to recreate your self first!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> because they are not looking at the obvious
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> If she is not in a relationship ,sure,why not?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Only Easy girls have sex in cars.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_30> Once a cheater always a cheater.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> GO OUT AND HAVE A GOOD TIME.......BE FREE!!!!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> i need to get to know her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> you are still pretty young, give it a couple of more years.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> But, I guess that can go for men too.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> i dont know of a site, but that is bc i like to see it myself.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> And also mention that whether she has a b/f or not that you two can still be friends!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> We truly either dont hear it, or dont care.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> If she wanted to date me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> personally I gave my wife Irises....(that's what she loves) so ever since Irises are it!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Not trying to be mean, but a lot of men make the mistake again....
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> order one at a on line dating service.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> yes it is bad, because you are not like seeing the truth.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> My neice really likes this boy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> Lubrication= KY jelly or something similar...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> show him that your more fun than pool, or join in with him unless its not yur thing.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> with your particulars (tell me more about yourself)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> I hung out with my sister and friend's.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_10> The V A G I N A
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> LOUSY EXCUSE  AND SHAME ON HER IF SHE ACCEPTS IT.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Just dont make it so serious.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> Just wondering, i dont have any size insecurities.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Just tell he what you saw.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> Girls: This guy I like, he's really cute alright.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> If you're still wondering, find some gals who you are just friends with and ask them.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> now i've never had this type of connection with another person like that.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> a taller and more muscular brad pitt?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> SOME GUYS WILL TAKE A GOOD LOOKING WOMAN EVEN IF SHE'S A DING BAT, JUST CAUSE SHE LOOK GOOD.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> women should do what they're told only if they want to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> FEAR AND DOUBT CAN TRICK YOU.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> give up on him, you cant have a relationship with someone who wont open up.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_20> She liked me and made it sweetly obvious.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> do not get him in your life, get him out of your life.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> I guess biting is just on your list!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Tell u the truth K i don't even know
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> rubber duckie,buttercup,snookums or death on wheels
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> or 2 don't tell her and gust live with it but keep her as a freind
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> I'm a girl and I am already disgusted!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Can you imagine what it would be like in 10 or 20 years!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> DONT FORGET TO CHOOSE AND VOTE FOR BEST ANSWER!!!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> go up to him and get him alone with you.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> unless the guy is really hot and then i might tuck it in myself.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> If she aggrees then you don need to go somewhere else.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> if all else fails... sneak out lol.!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> After you look at it you find the answer to your question.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> THIS BOY MIGHT BE STILL SEEING THIS OTHER GIRL ON THE SIDE, OR HASN'T BEEN UP FRONT W/ HER.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> IF TODAY WAS A BAD DAY, TOMORROW COULD BE THE EXACT OPPOSITE.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> it doesn't make a diff unless ur a doc.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> Then I did it here at 16 and him at 24 BIG  BIG  BIG mistake.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> go up to the girl and tell her that she can't have him he is yours forever.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> talk to his friends and let them know you are interested in him!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> if the 2 siblings are getting married and they are close, why not have a double wedding?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> can you be a swinger and single, I thought swinging was purely a married couple deal.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> choose one of them the one ur heart approved
<NbChars_265> <LevSim_25> Is it hot in here ... or is it you?
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> well for one if she is your friend she will get over it and be happy for you.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> half price books on round grove and mac arthur
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> HE DIDN'T CHEAT ALL BY HIS LONESOME!!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> That way the kids dont have to choose one parent, which is wrong.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> Since your wife knows you better than anyone on the planet, ask your WIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> TO GIVE ROSES TO HIS LOVE OR SING A SONG TO CHEER UP HIS DAUGHTER.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> well firstly: FIND OUT IF HE WANTS TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU!!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> The one that you can't live without.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Tell him you don't think of him that way.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> guys are thinking the same thing about you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> Like my Mama said once, don't write no check your behind can't cash!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> a relation that makes u feel better... fulfills your life and leaves u restless if not with ur partner
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> SO I SAY IF YOUR SERIOUS, FORK UP THE CASH...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> So i say u should stay home until your a bit older.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_65> i am 46 and would like to find nice man to share life with any ideas
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> if you wanna play sports you should do it!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Yes you shouldn't date the guy
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> have lots of money when you ask her and the answer is Yes maybe,
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> I'm only 18 tho... so I have some time
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_10> STANDING UP W/HER LEG OVER MY SHOULDER
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> can u truely be in-love with someone or do you really just love that person.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> dont look for things to spice it up.

<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> IS THERE ANY GUY YOU LIKE IN UR SCHOOL?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> cuz  men  like to  show  off  for  their friends  even  if  there  friends  are  idiots
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> no because im sure ull be able 2 find a great male lawyer that will understand everything u say
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> Honey, who cares what all the girls think?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> both are single dad, nice guy.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> so stop looking just wait see what happens.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> u cant give money to some one n love or ask them to care abt u .
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> sending fake emails can come back to haunt you...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> see them both and dont promise to be exclusive to either, never lie about it, just omit
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> this is just not the place.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> just not too much becasue most women do not like cocky men!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> girls have a tendency to read into things a lot.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> the g babay right behind the ear back of neck
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> no i woodn hate you.i woodn hate u cuz i don no u!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Well I chaeted on this girl, and now I dont want to loose her.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> (you never said this was a reality book).
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Look 4 a guy that likes B.  :)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> Got a pick up truck instead of pimp car.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> always choose to be happy even when others think it's foolish.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Never had without so wouldn't know...but I will say that after thinking about it...whats the difference???
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Not age wise but job wise.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> and see what they think if the guy likes you.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> WARNING: Don't tell your frineds about her.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> A nice, hot cup and good conversation.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> they got married for a reason but somtimes people forget.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> u must work things out with ur husband first.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> if he calls you or comes to your house to hang out with you then he likes you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> or find somthing he likes that you can do.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> And......who wants half a person anyway, I am whole and dont want half a man or woman.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> buy him a dog and tell him see you later don't come back
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> This days, they say that they will stay...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> if you wink at her and she  smiles back
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> i dont think youve really had what you think youve had.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Is there a set age to where everyone 'should' be married or they'll be thought of as stupid???
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> put it in your bed room when you leave and he arrives.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> just don't do a heart shaped candy box or stuffed bear.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> give him a dose of his own medicine.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_80> because they always want to win
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> * space is for special reasons too!1
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> In that case, shame on you!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> and recently he's been looking at me alot too.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> i dont know but i am having the same thing happen to me

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> i cant tell you much but i met him in 6th grade.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Some guys like smaller girls, some like bigger ones.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> I know I don't want my daughter dating and she's 15 aren't you afraid you might catch something?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> You know what they say...if you never tried it, then there's nothing really you are missing!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> the men from honduras are so sweet.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> She probably didnt hear the line at all, all she heard was grunt, grunt, wanna do it?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> a club where men hang out at to watch woman  dance and if they are good they get paid.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_10> GOD ITS AMAZING THE POWER OF A SAMLL TAPE RECORDER WILL HAVE.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> I am not that into pain!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> then you should go and talk to him yourself.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> HAVE YOUR NEICE TALK TO THE GUY ABOUT THIS GIRL.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> also, when your man talks to another female in your face!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> how much new oil should be put back in?how much does this all cost to buy?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> So boy, you had better be serious if you even THINK you deserve to be with her again.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> talk to him or change your nickname
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> for all i know he's gotten tons of head.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> if she is then just tell her sweetly and hug her^_^
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> ur id is 'kaw'-ish 4ever  kaw-kaw
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> If you're single, and they're still single... then why the heck not?!

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> Atleast that what i would do.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> but guys go I guess several steps further.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Ofcourse there is latinos out here.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> If he don't like it then that is his problem not yours.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> im 19 in i love to have sex.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Whatever you do tho, do it for yourself!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> Even if you need to take a class or get some counseling.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> I figure he'd just lie anyway.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> well you know what they say u cannot forget ur first love.

<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> but if it's what i think then because i can!!!!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> : metaphoric Baby, you know i love pudding.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Keep your pants on until you get married.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> Boys that age just like to play.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> usually your gut will tell you or you instincts.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_15> IF THAT DONT STOP HER THEN IT'S TIME TO KICK HER A$$.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> PUSH IT PUSH IT REAL GOOD

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> that err on the side of flirtatious.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_20> read up on sex murderers habits.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> I just hope it dosent make you not trust all guys because not all guys are like that.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> get friendly with some other dude(preferably one he doesnt care for).
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> make it special unique and memorible
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Managing a girl is like trying to herd cats;  it doesn't work.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> not really, you can pee just fine with a small penis, too.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> What is it that you want.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> it is the only way to get through life.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> THATS ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> so just set things straitght with him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Be sure footed by giving him hints first if that don't work just say what on your mind.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> (a lot of women said its good when guys know how to use it)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> besure to ask him if he is guy 1st?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> that is the problem, don't start looking, if u wait long enough the right woman will come to you.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> I told you I married him!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> dont let the image of a spanish man make u blind to their real intentions.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> Don't do this if you are trying to get pregnant just to keep a guy.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> sorry 'bout that its a_maclash@yahoo.com... hope you'd drop by!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> he was as ugly as... even shrek is better.she wanted to bolt, but she didn't.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> unless you give them permission, but what ever you do.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> This is hard.......you don't need advice you need payback....start flirting with other guys.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> And everytime she gets hurt in the end.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> If not then let your answer be heard, NO!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_65> Try a little trick I heard on the radio.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Butt doesn'tnecessarily have to be big (real big ones are gross).
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> r u just askin` dat to get to know girls and hookup?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> start seeing other guys or keep yourself busy
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> Love yourself and have fun doing it.

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_10> PROBABLY NOT U LOOK LIKE A GEEK
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> i have no clue... maybe because they are embarassed to act upon what they really want..
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I keept moving in the fist man who said he wanted to be with me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Yes, but they are either gay or married!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> i woudl help if i ubderstood what ur asking
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> at least you can say you are a happy fool not a lonely wise person.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Look longingly into your man's eyes, and ask him,  Would you be mad at me if I were pregnant?
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_40> He's like 2006 years old now lol
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_30> You need to go to counseling with him.....trust me i know....i was like him
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> 3: were both 14 and i dont think we are allowed to date yet.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> I want a man who goes to church oh yes you have to a church going guy.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> You can't MAKE someone love you & you really don't want to even try!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> DO YOU WANT TO FIND A MEMBER ON YAHOO FI SO MY E-MAIL IS KIKILOVEJUNETTA@YAHOO.COM
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Don't compare it to anyone else's life.

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> How bout putting some details in it...
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> Spend lots of time with him.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> stick on a wig... or a chest wig
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> make him laugh at least 2 times a week.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> It prooves that you care about her ^^
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> They're not, Just every 28 days.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> 21 and he is my husband now
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> As far as money...Fake it till you make it.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> Right now, we're really good friends and I would even say she likes me too to some extent.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> im really srry bout what happened :(
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> I listen to him daily .
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> that depends on what the definition of is is
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> sorry babe, your'e gonna have to give her some space on this one.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> If he's fun and you like him...go for it.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_40> Have fun and live a little.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> LOVE & PARENT'S COME IN ONE  PACKAGE.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Lots of women these days still use their maiden names, even after they are married.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> Sorry, 22 is too early to get married!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> no, that implies that ya want to have coffee with her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> if yur a virgin then think it thru a little bit more.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> You never write....never call...not even a Hallmark!!!!!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_50> If YES, then, you are too shy.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> i just don't know what to do.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Scenario:  I am a married man with pictures of my child on the wall.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> Get out now and if you don't, please don't have kids.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> DEFINATELY TELL YOUR NEICE THAT SHE DOESN'T NEED TO FIGHT OVER THIS BOY.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> sign uo in perfet match and these things
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> No, only crazy girls think that way
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> This is sort of a strange question.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> why do u think girls kick guys' balls?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> how could someone be born some way that is automatically not okay?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> look in your phone book for your closest alanon group.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> and yeah...there's no way that i would even date someone if i knew that they did that.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> The guy down at time square that calls me George and ask's for my money...yes.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> yeah whtever flirting is flirting someone just thinks ur hot
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> you make new friends who you can trust and wont abanden you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> love would come through out ur life not money .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> yes, I have It's like any other dating site, but a little different.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> The next girl's dad was totally scarey and always home, and nothing ever happened.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> they get the satisfaction and this manly ego that they made a girl submissive.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> dont try to be someone you aint.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> what is meant to be will be.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> If my man pulled some mess like that, I would go straight beserk on him!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> give them enough  rope and they will hang themselves.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> You're not always gonna find what you're looking for.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> talked i mean like you were going out and she talked the whole time!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> dude....young chics are screwing older dudes.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> Look at Clark Kent, he's no Superman...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> NOT NOT NOT, why would you want to be with such an older man?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> U cant be a vegitarian on a Valentines Day
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> Can I get some Sexualdicease without having sex with my girl?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> most definitely i woudn't want to have sex with a little dick man
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Only problem is, she's 15 and I'm, well...23.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> dont change to make yourself right for some other guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> sure why not it would be fun.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> 2: i dont wanna just randomly walk up and say it in front of everyone.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> i have a gay friend and he is so awsome!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> If he needs that much impressing he shouldn't be in my bed (or me in his)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> I CAN'T SEE WHY THE GIRL WOULD WANT TO FIGHT YOUR NEICE IF THE TWO HAD BROKEN UP COMPLETELY.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> how can i make the girls walk to me if i'am bald man ?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> when you figure out the answer to this let me know asap
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> he dribbles... he shoots... he scores... 2 points...
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> its sometimes called the ego-thing-you-know... let him do whatever he wants to do.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> No, he is not a loser..and there is nothing wrong w/ being a virgin at 18!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> gAY PPL R ASWMOE I WISH I HAD A GAY FRIEND _
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> whew..has this earth already typecasted men to be all that indecent?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> Are you my husband trying to fool around?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> 'cause he wasn't the perfect man she wanted!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Did you fart... becase you blow me away!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Anyways I won't tell her without evidence.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> don't waffle or try to be cute.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> Good luck with that, your gonna need it!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> then get somethign like that- football tickets or jersey, music DVD, membership to a fan club.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> your going  to need all the help you can get.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> I don't think I'll ever find a female my age like her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> be  his  friend  get  his  trust
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Two wrongs dont make a right.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> and when a real man .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> When guys don't shower, red hair shows real bad.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> from experience at the time u think love but they won't always be ther for you ur family will.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Because girlfriends dont really care about husbands after marriage.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> this may sound wrong..but trust me, it works.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> and i dont feel bad if he seays no.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> Be a queen get a king!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> dont trust ANYONE that you meet thru the internet!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Depends on how late you're having coffee.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Once i used the reason of the media!!
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> Yes, but I never go there.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Or am I just barking up the wrong tree?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> maybe we stupid, but that why women just gotta let us kno some stuff
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> A girl with JUST good looks will get boring after a while, she has no real core to her.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> i see him every day at dance and im not sure how to dump him.....help please
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> ha thats been said before hasnt it?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> Well, don't leave us hanging... IS he asking you out?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> But remember this once you cheat on her she now has an excuse t cheat on you
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> But I know it's hard when there are kids involved
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> i dunno, im in a situation like that right NOW.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Once I dumped a girl because my friends made fun of her chin.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> i have lots of guy friends, and the subject of sex never even came up.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> a person gets 1 chance only.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> :)  No, but for real--why don't you want your mom to know?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> Now to me that seems a little drastic and all of a sudden, no?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Men are strange and you can never figure out what there thinking
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> Do you think my bf is cheating?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> i know that if i keep hanging out with him my feels will grow for him.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Don't forget the song that went ... red roses for a blue lady.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> if you have to ask you are too young.
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_25> FYI- i'm 29 and he's 30.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> how cheap?-howza 'bout making him a hand made card.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> i think its because they r tring to b ur reel mom
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> whenever my lady calls me nasty....i reply; you like nice boys or nasty boys?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> My mom didn't know until my older brother told on me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> You can use message oils and sex toys it lot of ways to spice up your sex life.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> no offense, but you really need to go out more.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Ciara was making out with Missy Eliot, hehehe
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> love is when u`re w/ the guy u love,then hate comes when he breaks ur heart
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> Coz if he's not, I will...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_10> HE IS A HOTTIE (I THINK)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> i still love my first love and still love all the girls i have ever loved to some extent
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> no they aren't he said call her miss wow......get it bow wow miss.wow
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> god is great, but he is not going to solve your problems for you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> if you really want a relationship with her you should.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> always double date with a girl friend, double dates, g roup dating etc.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> never done it would rather say hey im bored and need something new
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> Maybe but try not being so hard up.That helps a lot lmao
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> i hate having people tell me what i'm gonna do!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> im sorry to say but yes.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> i have learned why i am the way i am.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> If you don't want to become pregnant,or contract an STD then i suggest you don't.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I wouldn't hate you because of it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> No matter how independent(or superior) that woman is, somebody had to fall for her...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> well, ive been with 60+ women so i cant say no
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> Just tell him that you like him too much to be his girlfriend and that friends are better...
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_10> YOU DON'T SIT BACK AND IGNORE WHAT HE'S DOING, YOU STAND GROUNDED FOR SOME RESPECT!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> Something is wrong   All I feel is distance!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Some woman might want an old fat guy hehe....if they have money.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> mushi.. mushi.. im a japanese girl!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Nope, but they'll expect her to make the first move.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Now if she starts looking on the male HUSTLER site, PROBLEM.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> jesus died so as to guilt trip so you can ask that question.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> How do I make them stop!!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> If she isn't the one,she isn't the one!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> but dont just rush into anything.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Generally you do or you dont.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Most women go by the saying, once a cheater always one.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> i have an attraction to spanish and latino and black men.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> romance with your mate does belong to you.is that what you meant?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Get a job ( If  you do not have )  Go out with your kids, have fun with them.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> no cuz they r stupid and their brains are VERY underdeveloped.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> do it in person or on the phone.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> He will tell u that he will never hurt u..But he will..anger has a mind of its own.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> IT HELPS TO SPELL YOUR QUESTION CORRECTLY!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> don't tell him it is not worth it
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> Oh, and i make my own money.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> i have 3 yrs clean & sorbor & a hole new life.

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> I just sorta went on about my days like i used to and it started to get better.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> should i just let him go on his way to try mend the relationship with his ex or what?

<NbChars_145> <LevSim_70> Like they say, nice guys finish last.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> i would forgive him but my trust for him would be low
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> Move on, you're 13... why do you even need a boyfriend?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> love is when you really care about the person.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> she is STILL trying to break us up!

<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> I say this because I used to be this way.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> are you sure this is the first time hes done this?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> i have never worried about that.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> high school aged male is the one I am after..jock...HOTT!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> no one wants a double wedding!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> it's not abnormal but most ppl have already.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> You are the only one that needs to be happy ;) Baby you rock !!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> (To friend) Can I borrow your garage?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> but imagine what if he says YES :-D
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> Yeah i think, but be careful.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> Thats ignorant as hell thats saying f uck u to her basically.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> you are too young for a boyfriend .
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_40> Yes forget about her p ast.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> And then...you could get with Sheena (the chick above me).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> leave them in the bathroom with some toys you can disenfect.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_25> I find drunk dialing to be a hoot.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> you really can't, i think time will tell
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> They were cheating WITH somebody  WHAT ABOUT HER??????
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> if you dont want him in your life, restraining order.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> But still im kinda surprise by your question.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> I don't agree with that at all and this just sounds ridiculous.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> C is very nice....D is too big
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> act as man u gonna get a lot
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> Say Hey baby do I get any fries with that shake.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_35> Love shoudl always come before sex (not saying it didn't).
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> how do i get over him?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> its so unfair to both parties.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> and there is no rush on should I get a boyfriend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> It'd be awesome if a whole lot of really cute girls would chase me!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> like how do i get him ta look at me and say my outfit is really ya know pretty.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> ya i think they r engaged but i am not positive
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I cook ,shop ,and all sorts of things.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> if its over then talk to whom ever you want!you dont need his premission.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> give more info...bf thats off to college, moved away?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Just take caution that you don't do alot of that in front of him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> you are looking wrong area i think.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> no thugs becausen they can kill you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> cover up is only temporary, and it s not originally you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> No they'll just completly demolish your dreams!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> I think that it is when thier balls drop!!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> you just keep being you and forget about them
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> There are lots of things that don't even cost anything...except your time.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Don't take any tension if u r masturbating.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> Okay I'm 15 My mom don't let me do shit.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> For a girl like that, it's worth waiting, isn't it?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> some girls are shallow and think looks are everything but really personailty matters
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> I had a girlfriend that her ex beat the Sh... out of her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Girls check out guys as much as guys check out girls.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> um...well he seems like hes making a exuse well thats wat i think at least
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> its the best thing you have ever felt you dont want it to stop once it starts!!!!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> Hey jim.. you suck in bed.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Just because one man never finds it doesn't mean that it's not out there.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Just keep an eye out, you can never be to sure...........
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> So try and ask about her parents first.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> They are all ugly dumb b*tches.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> kick over a few stones...everybody has a purpose in life ..you just gotta find what it is.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> yea my b/f is a pretty decent guy
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> If they are cooler than your expectations, great...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> Whose trailer did that happen at ?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Yeah, like he'd even care if someone as old as me thought he was a cutie!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Who cares what other pepole think?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> sorry don't mean to throw your husband in a boat like that.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> or u could go to some club, like a sports club?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> dump him and hook up with me!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> let me know what you think.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_45> Are u sure he loves u?if not forget him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> you have to become a whole person yourself before you get serious again.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> but I catch him staring at me during class.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> When you scream at a troll, he wins.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> cause you've just took my heart away!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> If he likes pool more than you, and this makes you feel bad, dump him NOW!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> you know parents to know  what's best for their kids!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> because they're men it's encoded into their geans at birth
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> hold her hand and look into her eyes to say it.....trust me it works
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> the fact that people hate others b/c of their sexual orientation makes them idiots.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> I think it you just say things like that to girls, you may have some luck!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> me and my best friend been friends since 9th grade and we are now out of school.anything is possible
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> yes thare just hard to find
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> And don't assume what people think about you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> (I don't know of any, sorry)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> sure i'd love to make friends with you... just drop a line or two on my inbox!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> This frustrates guys a lot, apparantly.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> Like she has the lock and i have the key!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> both have to work at it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Because we are good at it!!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> how can i learn how to understand guy there so complex
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> I dont know, maybe he got bored...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> BUT TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHY HE DID WHAT HE DID AND BE OPEN WITH HIM.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> because we don't need them trained to say we're wrong.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> YOU SHOULD LET HIM ASK YOU WHEN HE IS READY.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> No it's not wrong at all!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> take a chance all she could say is no.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> If it's his only you are outta luck.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> * can i buy you a drink, or do you just want the money?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> I would not worry about that yet.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> date other guys work on you cause your #1
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> love is an emotion not an attraction at tha end of tha day whos best for you
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> Do not let them get to you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> go for it..... you only live once
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> yes i do and i'm so greatful that he did
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> they will always remember and falling in love becomes that much harder.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> i have real love in my heart.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> i love my boyfriend so much.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> But I don't think I have really ever been in love with someone.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> answer master has it, that is just not right.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> go get a rubber ball and let's get this game started!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> you're a little young to be dating don't you think?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I have to ask: Why date someone at your age?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> 12 is far too young to be bothering with boy girl nonsense.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> If you think he is cheating, he probably is...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> he came around everyday, and called 24/7.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Laugh it off and say, Whoever he is, he's alucky guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> jsut be yourself if you have a good personailty then you will have no problem getting a decent girl
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> In love AND war ANYTHING is possible!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> im 18, lost it when i turned 18 last march n im addicted to it.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> How about you ask her for starters if she likes you or not??
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> time is forever and forever is where you will want to be with him right?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> REMEMBER THAT JESUS WAS A VIRGIN.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> BUT   HERES  SOME  GREAT  ADVISE   TO   HELP   YOU  FIND   YOUR  PURPOSE   THAT  I KNOW   WILL  HELP .
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> hell no, obviously you dont care or love her, why cheat???
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> but be sure that you love him and he is a nice person.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> And stop taking walks with this gal.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> I CAN IMAGINE HOW IT WOULD BE REALLY HARD TO GET OVER A SITUATION LIKE THAT..
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> If I can give you advice.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> Just kidding... that never worked for me... Only time and another person's affections can mend a broken heart...
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> If you realy want to learn.. then get out there and date..
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> Try to make that 200 boys .. :P
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> Your Friend no matter what, Rachel
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> my guy mentioned to me beforehand that he found that embrassing.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> When i threw up in class
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> i plan on getting my boyfriend some cologne or silk boxers.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> yes that is right so just go with it
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> and really i'm not trying to be mean or a bu ttwhole, but really stop doin things like that!!
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_35> Flirt with her, and then ask for eMail and tell her what you think.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> and im thinking about turning away from him PLZ PLZ PLZ HELP!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> my boyfriend has been calling me his honey and baby for the past 6 years.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Are you just going to pass me up?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> a fishing pool and a ticket to a great fishing spot
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> both on the net and radio .
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_35> Oh Course...and dude, Your Not Pathetic.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> go to disco and you will find many of them there that like to have sex with you !
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> u might be allergic to latex condom or the spermacide
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> you can't force her to forgive you.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Just hang in there and be strong.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> hes shy and ive known him fir like 3 years.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Any i over reacting or what?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Certainly not, I go out with many friends, but don't consider myself as dating many guys.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> with a sexy tone.. good luck
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> He obviously doesn't love you if he needs to cheat.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> enjoy it as often as possible
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> So, how do I do it if it happens again?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> There are only 2 times i wanna be with you...and that's now and forever
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> I noticed girls do check out, just like guys.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Hmm.. What kind of things does she like?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> your on the wrong site jack a**..
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> just give it sometime...you find her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i have been participating in cultural interaction and now i want it in my marriage.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_35> Hit the gym & bulk up.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Tell her that you don't want to ruin your marriage, life, family, kids, reputation...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> I said No, I do not love you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Always...which is why no matter how bad it gets, keep in mind that 'this too shall pass'!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Who says Braini girls are not pretty.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> other than that maybe they just really don't feel loved.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> His voice gets softer (Hey, you) when ever you two talk.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> ME,I LIKE CHATTING WITH ANY GUY ON THE NET.WHAT'S YOUR EMAIL?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> It's nice to think it looks don't matter, but they most certainly do.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Why you do not shut the hell up.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> we have tried counseling that didn't work,because for 1 we didn't finish.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> it all depends on the situation but i guess i would say honesty is always the best policy!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> smile and let her talk first.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> when you do find her, don't screw it up!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> A little overprotective, but god, if shes already doin it at the age of 5 i will go ballistic.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> But sometimes guys can be stupid and shy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> i need one too, but it wont come by sitting down , go out and have fun!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> fat people make me nauseas i would never date a fat person
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> i have no idea...should i stop being more than a friend to her...or should i fight for her?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> let him make the 1st move more romantic and your not to young to kiss
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> i found some lip stick in the van .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> the best way to propose to your girlfriend is to ask her to marry you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> finaly i gave in because i was tire of him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> i was told that someones out there for all of us.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> My advice---> Do wat love makes you do!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> i'd say when your'e ready,but i perfer 18 and up
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> Thin is in pick the skinny 1
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> give each other space keep very good comunication and there should be no rules when in bed
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Ohhh, I did go out with him .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> I'M A BLACK FEMALE WHO LOVES MY BLACK MAN VERY MUCH.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> or sleeping with someone but having one of them not orgasm, is not considered sex just making out.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> So how about you ask your own kind where to find some pussies .
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> Just tell him...you never know he might want you to.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> I was wondering how old is her boyfriend anyway, is he the same age as you?I
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> It wouldn't take too long i suppose, something about 2 months or so wouldn't do bad
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> That means around 1 out of 4 men will actually not cheat on their woman.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> or do you like some meat?
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_35> Perhaps you should be asking HER... just a thought.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> But a decent guy won't mind.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Well if u r asking this question maybe u are a little to young to know the answer
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> because guys are pigs hot jerks and physical features are the only words in their dating rule book
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> Get the hell out of thee house.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> if she says no then respect her reasons and don't push.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if she does, do you really want tha kind of woman in your life?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> hell yeah... some of the best tricks out there.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Im not saying other races arent im just saying that From my experiances that i find them like that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Why would he believe that of you an his best friend!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i am more interested in the relationship, and getting to know my girl
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> because a lot of you ladies let them.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> you need to tell your friend you like her, or get over it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> not really, because if they have girlfriends, then they must have something that's attractive and obiously, u see it.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> Kiss- 15 to 25 seconds(It was New Year's) The Mommy and Daddy Dance- About an hour
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> try to live without boy friend for some time its better if you can do
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> (LOL I wonder if is it possible to have sex with your clothes on?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> maybe cause you are a virgin
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> this is what you do.show him a little hip a little thigh.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_10> MY EXPERIENCE WAS THE MOST EYE OPENING!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> I boy talk that means    Hey Girl I SO like you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> show her you love her by doing things she likes like getting her something she really wants or likes.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> of course she know, if she look at u, she like it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> how much time have u spent with her?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> And no matter how I tried, to be kind.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> if you are looking for just positions then get a positions book
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> Take your kids and get out ... NOW!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Dont let him pressure you to get married!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> just tell her that she looks good.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Strike up a convo with him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> I have a friend who just became single and she swears by this.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> I'm mean to the guys i like its a way fo saying i like you
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Wow..this is one I actually know about.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> a pretty long time just don't let he/she minipulate your mind.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> All I am going to say is be careful what you ask for.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> this one sound boring and like he doesnt really want to have fun with you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> yeah i paid for my best friend to go to camp.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> it is hard and yes, you do miss the person, but we have found ways around that.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> hook me up i'll give it a shot...>:)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> HEY SWEETIE I AM PRUOD TO BE ONE AFTER ALL  I AM 13!!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> I never had a relationship with this guy from past.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> IT'S NOT AS IF I WOKE UP ONE MORNING & SAID OH I THINK I'LL BE A LESBIAN.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> ofcourse u still love her and i cant blame you for that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> get close to his frends.... n b a gentle garl in front of him..make him c ur beauties....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> the best is to be honest.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> a long time...just remember that time heals all and you will be healed
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> you need to upfront with him...let him knw how you feel(like he's ignoring you)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> love is age less .. love is immortal... its not a relation this is a tie of soul
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> hey...i like a girl who lives far from me!i met her at a camp...you should listen to your heart!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> I'm so curios and can't wait any longer!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> the trick is finding one that wants it all
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> anything she is cooking try to assist her in style in the kitchen
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> believe in youself at all times
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Where can I find their website
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> My dad yells at me about it because my sister is not around.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> i asked my boyfriend to go out with me i wasn't going to wait on him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> If you just have to have sex, then move on a leave this girl alone.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> gay men as long as they have good taste.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Once you get the feeling that you can't imagine your life without him then you'll know
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> If I kissed a close friend I wouldn't forget it either.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> better yet mail it to a wrong address!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> You could never go wrong with that!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> no ur avatar looks like $hit
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> commiment, women who are independent and women who aren't scared to put it on them
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> The ones I catch do, I think, anyway, it's the only way to make them be still.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Yeah we love ya and all...but we still want to hit it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> how do i get him to talk to me about his life and how he cools off?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> r u listening to music rite now?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> those old-fashioned wooden seats just hurt when they splinter!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> (faimly guy) are you a boy or a girl?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> if the girl eat to much.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> Aren't we spoiling men like that.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> i have always believed that when someone is gay they have the hormones from the opposite sex
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> no.. that would be an unnessasary lie
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> Be honest about it and maybe the relationship won't end if you don't want it to.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> If He was love u  are Start talk her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Do not abuse back two wrongs don't make a right.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Rub her bak or somethin you know, make it exciting
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> or should i break-up with him?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Eventhough you are the smallest person its the average...   1 tablespoon...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> but don't go out with him, if you don't want to.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> no- are you an internet stalker?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> step away and just leave her alone.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I realy, honestly, think it does.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Tell him you are gonna be bored this weekend.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> my girlfriend does, buy my wife does not
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> dear if you put god frist in all thing you find that there good in men.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> it's not stupid you can learn many things from others
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> becuase there are plunty of girl's who will say yes.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> if she just wants the attention, shell answer right then.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> but first is that only in your mind or not?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> you can tell after you kiss :))
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> depends on da guy .. but rite now i got me a gf
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> not until sex becomes boring think about it
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> the average penis is 5 to 7 inches.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> But I've learned alot about myself.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> that just depends on how willing you are...to be the second of the bunch.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> take my advice and consider it ok
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> i intend to end my 'adventure' coz i'm not at 20ies anymore.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> i think every guy just gets chocolates.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> (this can also lead to more luvin).
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> Oh, and if shes changing her personality all the time, STAY AWAY!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> Can't seem to get her out of my head!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> its alot cleaner and looks alot nicer too.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> thats gay... if she won't then shes not worth it
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> listen here to all of you people that dont understand.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Have you ever dated a guy because of any of these things???
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Ok well you are young and you just kissed.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> we don't make love as often if at all.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> IF he screws up again then dump the bum.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> Eg : Snow White, Cinderella and etc!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> strawberries and cream regular whipped crean chocolate honey, cinammon, etc.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> then it is a good sign.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> he lives far away and his best friend just got hurt really badly.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> pls ur question seems 2 be confusing
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> all guys show if they like you differently.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> I pick up other girls and have 3 ways with him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> That they won't be men enough.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Walk up to him and say I like French Fries, do you?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Hey I have advice for you.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> ya about 6 weeks in advance.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> PAIN THAT DOESN'T KILL YOU MAKES YOU STRONG...  Dude just hang on...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Why would you make YOURSELF look stupid like that?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> Straight parents Gay son Lesbian daughter
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_30> Flat head for my beer, no teeth for my ****, Mute

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> look for another guy next time think before u have sex.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> and we should know that we are in love because its a great feeling.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> me personally, i find it sweet.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> mmm, hard one here, well ur only 16, why not try to find someone else?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> I don't care what people say, theres always a way.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> don't b the other girl in the relationship b/c if she finds out & they break up.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> ex: u culd tell dem straight up     flirt     ask a friend to tell them     write a letter/send email     etc...
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> if the guy decide to go dutch in paying.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> If it is ok for you to date, I definately think you should be brave and ask her out.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Boys tend to make fun of ya when the flirt.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> I wanted her to say there’d be some day, Be crawling on my knees, to ask her back again.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> that was maybe the saddest breakup ever..   honestly, there isnt a good way.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Ok, Ok, I know, not all of you are evil ice queens.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> you dont have to finish everything in one sitting though.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> I want me a strong strapping man!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> tell that bi@#h to kick rocks.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> WHEN YOU FELL, FROM HEAVEN WHAT?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> I find out about a little baby girl .
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> ( WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO  MAKING LOVE?)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> TRY TO UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER IN THE BEST WAY POSSIABLE... 7.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> who cares what ur freinds think, they're not gonna be the ones dating her!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Either he likes you or you have a booger hangin.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> just hang out and observe the other person,,,you will know if they are true or not
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> A simple walk in the park sounds like a good thing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> At a very young age I found myself attracted to women.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> It happens to the best of us  :-)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> You two have 2 beautiful children god has blessed you with.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> And if he still won't tell you ask him whats up.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> he is not the man that turns the earth around overnite so how busy can he be?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> plus theres a guy here whos bothering me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> There is no way around this bro.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> THE FIRST PERSON GOT IT COVERD IM 17 TOO DONT 2
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> She likes playing games then she might need to know how it feels.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> Then ask her is she's seeing anybody at the moment?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> then later that night he tried to get the money back.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> just because of the person who did it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> i dont see why this is even an issue!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> have chicks as friends and make sure the booty call is hung up on quick.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> go ahead make ur own rules
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> if u truly love each other u shouldnt but you can still flirt wit other guyz
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> there are a lot of things to consider here.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Some people dont even know about search!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> and I guess he was playing me out .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> So why use it to celebrate a permanent union??
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> we left that club and went to another.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> the worst he could say was no.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> You don't have to take it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Male or female who can't get enough sex.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> Like... -  well, you tell me first ... , and after that you have some more clues.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Just try to remember what you loved about her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> If it just doesnt work...see a sex therapist.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> my age is 17 i m a pakistani
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> But if she tells you she likes you, she's lying.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Then I saw him watching me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> if you really like him than take the plunge.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> dont just take the next girl to come along becouse your lonly.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> but here lately i have wanted to be single again.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> all i can say is u will know when it happens.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> What does your guilt tell you?...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> All girls are lesbians if you get them drunk enough.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Start hanging out in coffee houses.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> When I say heavy I don't mean 5, 10 or 15 pounds overweight, I mean fat.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> go and get other mister right and deserving for ur affection and will love u honestly!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> things that hurt, u no what im talkin about).
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> just to get some random man turned on and then to part ways.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> I love black men, though I never been with one.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> I married a man w/ a large one, but certainly not for the size of it.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> whenever you think the time is right
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> I need to get a life.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> learning how to kiss someone is more fun in person than it would be to learn online!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> considering that, last i heard there was something like 27 million people on myspace.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_15> THE WAY GOD LOVES US IS THE WAY YOU GIVE LOVE BACK.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> when you two talk about it
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> im a virgin and i am proud of it
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> i am joshua, based in nigeria.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> thanks gentlemen for your honest answers.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> I gotta tell ya it ain't cool.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> stick it in there and move it back and forth
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> or the things that couse conflict.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> no, and dont go back it wil only end in pain!

<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> Go to clubs or party  u will find ur man somewhere
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Hey, maybe I'll live to be 200?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> You already have one unless she does to.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> Doens't work and you just waste your time.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> its the only way to truly win him over!!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> Tell her to use birth control
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> too many temptations...why do you think girls have breasts implants?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> (but of course she would) But how can I trust her now?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Would you date an ugly guy even if he had a nice personality?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> If he like you, then you are breaking the ice towards possible a great relationships..... A WORD OF CAUTION.........................
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> If you can't find clues, then get him some m and ms
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> the artist Van Gogh once cut off his ear and sent it to his girlfriend

<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> ....pliz dont be vulgar this is seriose..

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Hope you find your answer soon :)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Not a good example for the kids hon.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> hmmmm.....  tell him but don't say u love him thats not a good idea.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> i mean if they just wanted to make conversation we could have seriously talked about a thousand other subjects...right?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> this will at least start the convo off on a funny note.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> how do i ask out a girl that barely knows me?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> But in general, grandpa isn't sexy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> when you  fell  your  ready don't let  noone  tell you  otherwise
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> And don't worry what anyone else thinks about it.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_10> ME BEING A FEMALE MY SELF I WILL TELL WE WANT RESPECT,TRUST,LOVE,MONEY,LOVE TO COMMUNICATE,AND OF COURSE OUTGOING THATS RIGHT
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> but dont make it sounds like your jealous.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> you'll do fine even if it's not with this girl!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> Anytime after that you should just pick up hookers =)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Honey, your looking in the wrong place, and you probably like bad guys.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Lots of people at that age talk about sex, but most of them haven't done it yet.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> You can like this guy, but remember one thing: men are men, and they will always be around.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> but over all .. variety is the spice of life .. even women know that.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> Oh wait- he does like you, but he just likes you more than using his hand.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> IM STILL A VIRGIN AND WONT HAVE SEX TILL IM AFTER MY WEDDING !!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> lol okay but anyway I like them!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> I still am a little childish in some ways!BUT!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> I didn't know that they did!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> I dont no what to say or do.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> ... and send him a wink.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> if he makes anny overly done complements about you then you know
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> now if you and her isnt seeking a divorce and on good terms meet her for your sexual needs.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> Damn, you really need grammar lessons dude.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> get a new Gf that love u n not to be calling u that
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_50> have you forgiven your ex husband?
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_35> all you need to do is wait and stop trying.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_30> (I do not think crushes last 4 or 5 years).
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Do you know what kind of music he likes?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> call him and talk about it....ask whats been going on with him and why he hasnt called....

<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> Still, I am what I am, and I'm really wondering if thats okay.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> My BF broke up with me a while ago.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> And who said that intelligent men aren't good looking?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> Does he do little special things just because.......not because he was asked?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> IF HE REALLY LOVES YOU, HE'LL WANT YOU WHATEVER CHOICE YOU CHOOSE...LOL.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> and theni have to answer quickly,no.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> all 4 of them are cute and kind.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> my g/f dosent know if she loves me or not, why dose she say this?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> no either they got books or looks
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> I figured since we are playing here & I don't really know you I could ask.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> depends on the woman, some no, some yes
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> You can have a any relationship u want untill that u like it and you belive that it's good.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> e-mail me at for more questions @ aleighkins@sbcglobal.net
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If you really mean to ask than maybe you should do your homework.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> I just want ONE women, period!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> If she is a part of your life why would you NOT want her there?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> but it my b hrdr 4 my parant 2 read.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I deal w/ it every day.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> From a 4 to a 6.5 or so.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> i would dump her (if i was a guy)!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> I like them as big as I can get them and the one I got right now is HUGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> i can teach u for $20 an hour.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> THE MANS job in my oppion.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> if you dont ask her out you will never know what you are missing out on.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> and they dumped her like, in a sec.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> That's the best you can you do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> There are ugly girls and there are hot girls.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> yes it is half half, truth/humor
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> find someone who is not so selfish.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> if u tried all u can, maybe it wasnt meant to be
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> all that the text said was kiss nothing else and it was from a guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> Can't hurt to talk to him!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> Think this says it all:  Those who DO don't talk and Those who talk don't DO
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> find someone who is not so selfish.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> if u tried all u can, maybe it wasnt meant to be
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> all that the text said was kiss nothing else and it was from a guy.
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_15> Can't hurt to talk to him!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> Think this says it all:  Those who DO don't talk and Those who talk don't DO
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> I'm waiting to get married too!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> They have lots of tastes and you can talk about guys with them.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> you will some day trust me i have had at least 20 boyfriends this year
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> being unhappy is just as bad as lonly.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> TRUE LOVE AND BLISS CAN CO-EXIST.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> YOU SHOULD TELL HER RIGHT AWAY SO TOO LIVES DONT GET LOST.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> so keep it and u will never lose
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> he got mad because the strippers want me more.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> KEEP IN MIND NO ONE KNOWS THAT I AM GAY.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Make it romantic for both of you, not just her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Well, first of all because sex, what most men think about MOST of the time, feels GOOD!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> If you found true love youll know it and it will be hard to deny or fight
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> It will be the one whom u used the next day , as a whore!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> They don't live your life everyday , you do.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> but to be fair ask if him he could pay half and mom pays half.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> Maybe she is trying to tell you something!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> ladies what lines have u went for and fellas what lines have worked for u
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> But if you dont love him then drop him all together.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> Be your self the right guy will come!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> anytime you go outside the marriage its a sin duh!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> most of the time it does get to know him and go for it
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> Well, it could mean just that.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> And you need to marry someone you truly love inside and out with NO DOUBTS in your mind!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> becuz guys r affraid of wat other guys think
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> i am a pretty girl and boys like me a lot but its this girl that like me to
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> CUZ WITH A FACE LIKE THAT, YOUVE GOT TO BE AN ANGEL
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH A SWALLOWING REFLEX, OR LACK OF ONE....
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> And if your hair looks like whats on your avatar, please please make it nice and short.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> KIss THem and if it ment something then it was a great kiss!!
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_30> we want sex lots of it
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> um only she can answer that one.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> basically, dont be afraid to go out there and get him!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> theres TONS of gays a lezbos, and alot of ppl here aren't very good drivers.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> I wont forgive a guy like that.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> My snowcoming is coming up, & I'm not sure if girls like want flowers or something.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Thing is, I don't know why he cheated on you.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_30> do i leave and move out do i abuse back?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> just get near him and be agressive and figure out what is wrong with him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> but he nevers tells me what he does.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> but if you really love her then respect her feelings and then understand them.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> buy her beautiful gift give her the best hug.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> Get some self esteem, dump him and move on.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> check my answer for why guys cheat.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> but was never given a chance.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> we left and had good sex.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> Look no further then your own hand my friend, LOL.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> And it is too late to think about booty calls.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> Good luck dude, 'cause I know that has to be a tough situation.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> Yes, totally anytime that happens he might got a crush on you...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> maybe just because you need to ask this question means he isn't.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> dont just come out and tell him, hang out together alone, flirt, etc.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> not unless you seal the deal and meet up.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> they  just too dam old to have sex.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> And I don't know... what WOULD the next step be?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> whats up with you... how you doing?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Seems like I'm a little bit childish huh!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> and now hes tired of it and wants to find a nother sexy girl
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> There are probably things she will never do with you (i.e.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> i wouldnt say it straight to the face!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> they might even adopt u from your parents.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> yeah it's the 21st century women shouldn't be intimidated about men.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> They need to be told they are loved a lot!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> No....not all guys like thin women.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> Is it you or you dad whos living your life?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> i m foot fetish girl  love to suck and lick fem feet
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Once you guys are friends move foward from there.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> and mean it' he's a boy friend not husband.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> ok i go on my prom this year but the problem is that i can't dance.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Well that's a pretty bad message to leave on someone elses phone and your not doing anything..
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> My EX did that to me.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> You just have to trust your heart but you also have to think with your head.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> but just try coz maybe its ur time to be happy!!!!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> go to the cops for gods sake .. treat him and let him go to a physochologist !
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> she always will cheat   forget her
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> THONGS ARE ESIER TO PUT ON THAN REGULAR UNDERWEAR stud!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> Because they make you feel soft and sexy
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Beat the hell out of BOTH of them.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> but i think sex is the best one.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Guys and Girls...is it possible to be addicted to porn?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> wut do i do in a nice way to make him stop?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> a new Cadillac  don't be cheap  come one she LOVES you
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> you cant if he want to cheat he will no matter what you do
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> but somethings are best left unspoken.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Guys dont find famine victims attractive.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> If you think you are in love, you probably are.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> and its not mine or my daughter.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> no because they do their buisness in the street
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> MY NEXT QUESTION IS HOW DO I GET A TWO YEAR OLD TO STOP THROWING FITS FOR NEEDLESS THINGS?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> hey don't worry....girls also get into these kind of problems in their lives.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> my advice is to go with the roses!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> if he won't drop it, then the friendship is ruined (sorry) and you will have to move on.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> there's no problem falling in love with your guy best friend!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> then you can toake her to her favorite place or where yall meet.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i dont think its stupid or outdated, nor do i think she is a prude.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> my boyfriends family doesn't like me and he doesn't care about anything it seems.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> i wanna give him another chance but i cant 4get what he does...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> NAWW ITS LIKE WATCHING A MOVIE NO BIGGIE
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Go and ask someone out then, don't sit on the computer waiting for Prince Charming to IM you!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Just ask her to shave her beaver.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> What do I like about black men??
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> looks rnt everything, its ur personality that matters.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> its your call wahts cheating and whats not.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> Get 2 no the real her and really see if u 2 belong 2gether.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> he is trying to tell you something
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> becuase your husband must be very narrow minded
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> i would prefer gay men they r really good girl!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> Us guys don't like being in the frying pan much.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> I dont see the reason why not.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> If you don't know how are we suppose to know!!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> move on hunny there are better out there.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> I my self like what I like.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Dear Katie, First thing... you have to ask yourself... do u want him back?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> tell him to **** off no im just kiddin well do u still love him or not
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> It's a nice way of saying I want to dump you
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> I cant get off this site, good job to Yahoo!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> should i run for the hills and not look back?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Ask her if she knows what she's doing?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> great way to see how far she is willing to go.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> So do what you want .
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> yeah, most of us guys cheat... it's just a matter of time.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Hopefully for both of you, but if she refuses then for you alone.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> You don't want to be with someone you can't trust.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_30> plus the whole sacred sex thing.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> YOU WILL LIKE IT  SHE WILL ALSO.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> thats when you say, i don't know, i just wanted to hold your hand
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> then ask for his number, then go from there.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> but cant we all ask ourselfs the same question?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> i think she is pretty cool to ask to go.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> What is that guy breaks up on you?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> How should I show a girl that I really love her?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> well there should  be a divider for anyone who wants to talk about adult stuff.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> a nice romatic picnic on campus
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> if no - drive off extra slowly like a funeral procession.)
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> But yes they do and it sucks...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> they will like it alot better then u just walking by wit ur buds and not even noticing them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Yes (i'm up for a promotion)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> well im a female and i like boys.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> unless it's just a random thing and u don't want anything serious.....
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> in your dirty kitchen , be sure that there is a washing machine !
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> i know dancers only go after big spenders after their shifts, so be cheap.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Anywhere you haven't done it before.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Or has the times changed to women only liking the hustler or rapper vibe of shallow fast cash ?????
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> But I realize that never was her style.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Smart women and smartass women about equally.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> not all guys are players...some actually care about a womans feelings...i know mine does
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> usually some kissing, some feeling under clothes, clothes off, foreplay, sex
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> You love her she loves you or you wouldn't be married in the first place.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Get your children OUT of that house.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> it could mean he wants to kiss u but usually it means keep it simple stupid
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> I have no clue, but i hate guys with gold teeth!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> it's not easy to meet some1 tt fits u in future and he is my 5th bf.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> if your a guy dating a guy... no help from me.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> if you can live life withher carry on.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> I HAVE NO DESIRE FOR EVEN THE SEXIEST MEN.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> yes maybe they are, or their friend is =)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> there's a boy at my school that does that 2 me as well.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> can you imagine him/her being with somebody else?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Huh huh..they r not lesbians..they r gayz.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> If your in a relationship that you don't love the other person then why stay.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> 4) or for something a bit more simple...make her 13 cupcakes.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> (ie if she is overwieght or to skinny) I say sit down and have a chat with her.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> And you say I needed to tell you something.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> And once we do, we're no fun anymore!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> and i dont want to hurt her feeling and our chances of dating.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> because some like their 3rd leg (in between legs)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> ladies know when you are being someone you'r not.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_95> I like my guy to know things but not be a brainiac!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> hey, you know, go with the flow.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> this takes just a bit of planning.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> You've got to figure out what you like about it...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> She loves you, she loves you not... she loves you, she loves you not...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> I see him flirting with all these girls, and he won't even look at me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> good luck and hang in there!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> That just made you realize that you want more mature guys.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> If you like her ,ask her out!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> we're not hard to understand, its just that u don't pay enough attention, we give out little cues.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Geeze it doesn't get easier, does it?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> Then it's not fair to you or her to stay!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> And I'm thinking size does matter!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_45> Hope you get what I mean.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> dont go out with him, go for someone else.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> And many other stuff so no
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> straight  i love my big dicks
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> it depens if he is nice and friendly
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I think i will go crazy.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> I'm straight because you know i love my dicks!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I love him and I have a son.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_10> FAILURE,REJECTION,A FOXY FEMALE WITH A PENIS,BAD SEA FOOD,DEATH IN THE FAMILY,CASTRATION.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> I also don't care too much for kissing folk with really thin lips.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> I feel so bad for you....the answere to that, though, is you wait till they turn 18...or older.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> please do this and read them.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Be sure that you don't look like you are going to mug her or something.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> I don't have stereotypical gay speech & mannerisms.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> I think leigh is evil :o
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> go to your cities or towns public records website
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> IF IT'S MEANT TO BE, IT'LL HAPPEN.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> give him a hug or a handshake, depending on how well you know him.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> LOVE YOUR WIFE AND UPKEEP YOUR MARRIAGE VOWS.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> men are not into you unless they are in you .
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Im waiting for someone i trust to lose my virgenity with !
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> i like guys.....lol but i am a guy
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> so woman please take care of your man.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Eigher way I guess, my answer would be the same.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> that is the way it is.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> p.s he's 5 yrs olda the me so i have to find out if he thinks age difference matta's!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Well... why not flirt with them both and let them BOTH chase you a bit?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> BECAUSE HE'S ABOUT TO GO TO IRAQ AND I NEED TO TELL HIM BUT HOW...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> sometimes u no and sometime u don't.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Its all about your game man.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> and most of those guys are romantics too .
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> If I meet and with a women I am happy and don't need anyone else.
<NbChars_40> <LevSim_35> even  though  im   stil  aminor   theres  just  some questions  ihave  running  around  in   my  head.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> I know back in the day (olden times) royal families did that to keep the bloodline pure.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> i am a bit shy but i am eager to make some new friends here.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> try looking around your home town not on the computer
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> can u truely accept her for who she is, and love her even though she cant talk about herself?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Get your two kids and GO.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> well it depends on thr kind of boy u want, specify please.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> if it's ment to be then you will find a way yo work it out.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> I imagine it would be years later...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> i know it sucks to be lonely.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> Because they think it don't make em sluts wen they give us lads a BJ!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> If you put an honest effort into it then no not at all  you deserve better
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Marriage should be about trust !
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> If u love someone,u'd wanna be with them.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> But, I finally realized that we both needed to move on.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Have their dog pick fights with mine.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> no because if he is to blind to take ur hints maybe he is just not worth ur time
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> I'm not real sure but some guys do !
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> Ask him how often he wants to have sex.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> something like, if she says yes - honk their horns.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> If you have not already learned it, u will.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> you battle or argue on what ever he says.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> I SPENT 9 YEARS WITH THE WRONG PERSON AND ALWAYS WANTED MORE.

<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> well i think that you should try and meet other girls.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> No, I do not hink do.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> I told a girl I thought she was cute one time and got fired.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> bottom line think with your brain not your d*#K. jeez go rub one off or something
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> he knows i like him so tell what to do please
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> this is the only place i've lived.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> GREED IS ONE OF THE SEVEN SINS
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> If you think that is a little stupid then think again...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> a wise person once told me...dont go looking for love let love come to you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> I NEVER BELIEVED THAT WAS POSSIBLE.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> (it seems a bit like maternal love i guess :p )
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> if u were in front of me right now i would look at you but your not.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Well I am very sorry to here that...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> no nothing as love at the first sight.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> I mean, it's like driving a car, right?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> why should you put your life on hold because of a man?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> some men cant express their feelings.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> bathing with girls is really a cool thing.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> tackle the immediate hard ones first.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> BE ATTENTIVE, & LISTEN TO HIS EVERY WORD.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> don't know, mine was about 7th-8th grade
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> So when my number two guy acts like an ...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> i know that there is lots of stuff comin from people but ignore them and listen to your self
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> because most girls have low self asteem and most men are pigs, therefore most girls don't trust most men.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> the same goes you us :)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> She already loves you, just remind her why
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> just little reminds that we still love one another
<NbChars_35> <LevSim_25> i think he likes u, also i like a boy too, he is so cute!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Most of the time it will not work.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> i have 2 brothers - i would know.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Pick the one you would most like to go with, and ask them if they are going.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> I use to want my ex boyfriend and he was in another country and he totally blew me off.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> did you ever think about that.
<NbChars_40> <LevSim_20> oh my goodness are you serious???
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> we do not like wambam thank you mam.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> I don't know her neither Y.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_80> a cowboy hat or cowboy boots
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> to tell you the truth i would want him to make the next move
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> girl...quit dwelling...find someone that worships the ground you walk on...dont chase after the ones that drop you without reason.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> Let go of the love girl it is 1 sided,they are other men...go get em.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> WHY CAN'T ANYONE ON YAHOO ANSWERS SPELL?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> I AM HAPPY TO SAY I AM A VIRGIN!!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> 98 % would  now love is much different than just lust and sex...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> Just go on and put it out there, confrontation is underated!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Depends....but i like it if they put emotion into it ya know?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> On the other hand, if she says yes, then just don't screw up lol
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> The crative way i got proposed to...really romantic and easy...but UNFORGETTABLE!!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> if you love someone, let them go.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> a person that likes to have a lot of sex
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> U r 16 years old....is she 16 tooo ???
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Not only am I myself somewaht still a kid at heart but women are also!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> Hey guys i have a question.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> if it's possible, let love win.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> like a cd or a movie that he could watch with you mostly a scary one
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> Where have all the John Waynes gone???
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> There are a lot of jerk guys that only want sex from girls.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> My advice to you is to move on and don't look back.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> They came out really nice and I saved lots of money!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> Did he ever have the wrong woman!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> me and my boyfriend have been dating for almost 3 yrs.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> some men cheat because they have insucurities about themselves that they can over come.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> that is disgusting and if its rape/incest the as sholes need to die!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> God bless u for being concerned!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> trying buying...most drunks love a financial sponsor.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> .....and that she might be carrying the virus right now?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> he always comes back all better, but i dont know what he does.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> get him tickets of something of his intrest.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Next time you want to do something exciting, go bungie jumping.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Talk to him and tell him how much u hate when he dont answer.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> He's using you, don't let him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> And that's just one online dating service!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> then i wonder why should you guys get married at all because u r not sure of your love.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> love isnt based on looks its based o how you feel for that person.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> I hate it when this things happens...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> i would be very careful of this guy not that im judgeing but sounds fishy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> his reasons are probably stupid,superficial and he would be embarassed to tell you those reasons
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> but if you are talking about next year no.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> Make it a threesome...better yet get ur groove on and make it an octagon....WOOHOO!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> if you're a decent respectful guy, the right girl will come along.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Bad and mean personality, you mean like Ann Coulter?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Show her that u are the boss and dont let her walk all over u,.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> go out there and start meeting people!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> most men will go looking for what they can not get at home somwhere else.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> He really likes it and he definately feels loved.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> What a question....you know what..think about this..DO DOGS NEED TO WATCH PORN TO LEARN HOW TO F.U.C.K.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> i dont know what to say to you about the right one.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> All guys don't just want one thing....it depends on the guy and on the girl
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> So AVERAGE is where its at.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> she's your wife u cant just forget about the relationship.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> Maybe your ex was the right one and you blew it...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> I met this guy 5 months ago on my summer vacation.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> I bet she isn't gonna find anyone else that's gonna be so infatuated.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> it sounds good or it doesnt.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> try harder and you will find the right person
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> girl if you wait for him you'll be waiting for a long time.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> Maybe for about a week and then ask him for his myspace.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> if he doesnt listen when you try to tell him, then thats a problem.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> After all you two are not officially married.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Sure it is...why the heck not?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> but ask yourself this...does my wife loves me?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> dont do what people expect you to do.. do what you want to do
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> my friends me and my girlfriend think i'm doffrent and loving.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> H*ll yeah I would've been mad too.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> not if you dont think it is.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> I do sooo much for her and all she does is complain if I forget to do anything.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Whisper sweet nothings to her - and mean it.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> you can talk with me.. email me at ilove_michaelperez_forever@yahoo.com im bi.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> yea i like them to :)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> it scares me i dont know.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> then finally see how he reacts and well make your best judgement.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> well...you guys dont sound so meant to be.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Give him a gift from BJs./
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> i think its better if you talk to him if its bother a ot.

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> i posted before about my friend's hot friend inviting me to her party.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> you won't know unless you go look for it.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> be romantic and eventually if you havnt already tell her you love her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I know it is not always fun and at times is very hard work.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> The last time I checked, the vows were I do... not I accept that from you...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> First U r Confirm He is Love U or Not.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> and he gets with u he will prob cheat on u!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> her husband should be her greatest love..not her son.. not her father.. but only him...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> your friends might make fun of u but make sure u don't let them decide for u.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> you know have her say stuff like  yeah she's single ya know.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> do you need answers for this???
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> If it's someone you know from work... STAY AWAY!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> get a life and get a guy not a lesbo like you!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> can be able to catch someone's attention
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> maybe is another guy rounding her, spy her, lol
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> That aside, you should leave him anyway!!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> no no no, i am 19 and i am a virgin i am just waiting for the right girl.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> If she liked you earlier in life, why wouldn't she like you now?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> But if all he wants is sex and cig's...
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_50> 14 days after her period .
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> It's easy to say, once a cheater, always a cheart.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> and if you have a wife, do not do anything to hurt her !!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_20> check yourself for std hurry hurry
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> plus he never talks about his life.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> ye dere is n i am 1 ov dem
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> It Takes a WISE FOOL a life time to figure out he was a fool...
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> strat by saying hi to people try new things then my be u can meet new friend.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> weather it's weekly, Bi-weekly or what ever works best.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> what i'm saying is don't jump off the cliff until she does.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> would like answers from both males and females
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> im a kid growing up and dealing with the fact that my parents split.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> there's no way he'll say no.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> not neccesarily i like this girl for who she is even though she is skinny thats just a bonus...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> No matter how tempting it might be, don't badmouth him to them.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> There are no rules to love - just follow your heart :)
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> Admit that, and you won't ask questions like this.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> a guy said this to me,  you always look good but when your with me you look sexy
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> Next to her, I know no other.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> You are a female, God made you to be with a man!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> A little crass to throw a party, so will there be some tears??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> I had a friend wait until she found the guy she was going to marry.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Most older women don't put alot of weight in all that.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> some people never change no matter what they say, very few do so be careful
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> give her a romantic full day!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> How can I tell if she still does?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> Well only a s l u t  would not appreciate it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> yap it works as there always be a chance to miss one another
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> If things don't work out, they have lot's of other options...
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> brain first...plus some of the smart ones are good lookin too
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> does that mean he likes me or what?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> DO NOT GET MARRIED TO HER JUST FOR THAT PINK THING.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> some one else shes loving is around her mostly
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> She is his EX not his WIFE .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> No but I waited until I was in love (happened just after my 24th birthday).
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> Now about the stuff she volenteers for and you do.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> if you wonder, he wonders whether to marry you too.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> There really are REAL men out there who do not act like that.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> if you gotta ask then you aon't got it
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> telling someone you love them is something that cannot be taken lightly.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Now does his wife know about this little fling?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> get over it I mean youre never going to be taller than her
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> he dribbles... he shoots... he scores... 2 points...
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> I like to write notes..... but they do get shown to his friends so b prepared to get asked!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> IT'S NORMAL TO WONDER ABOUT WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN RELATIONSHIPS, BECAUSE THE WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN IS THE ATRACTION.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> like a raging forest fire, yet soft as a baby's bare butt.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> TALK TO THEM MORE AND TRY TO REKINDLE THE FLAME THAT YOU ONCE HAD WITH EACH OTHER.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> Signed, ugly gay white gal getting sex all the time.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> I DON'T BELIEVE ANYONE SHOULD CHOOSE A PARTNER JUST BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> they do not want to show their feeling, they think in that way they look more like hero
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> but there are more women then men which means more choices.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> maybe they're shy around u or more of a show off.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> If u don't u will most likly miss your chance                                                   ps.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> Yes, I do think thats too young.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> what should i do about me and him?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> and it put a LOT of preassure off of me!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> yes you have to pick one boyfreind ok
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> And make sure she has a orgams everytime :)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> if u just go and face them they'll adore u!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> Anyone will if you are a nice person.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> Yes, um no I dont know ask her!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> no way of knowing i dont guess.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> But hey I got 2 points from you at least.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> one thing that i find odd is, that he is married telling you these things.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> try the dating on the web.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But yeah it kinda worse when its valentines day...   Look for another valentine...
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_45> They sell blow up dolls at Spencer Gifts
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> if he loves you he will want to be with you no matter what the cost.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> I can't take back what I did.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> and how you can go about meeting that need.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> that would be material love and it doesn't last long so i would not take it
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> my boyfriend was pissed as i said in the last question i asked.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> gay men because i dont want to have my men touch another womines behind or rirr!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> theres this ugly guy who likes me and i dont like him one bit!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> It wasn't easy, but it was worth it!!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> therfore the fact that you know the word sin, makes it so.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> no i am 11 and im here to awnser and ask.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> dont jump in frist one that looks at you .you find him .hope it helps.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> I know it's scary but you soon get use to it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> no...you stop if you want to stop!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> And if it's both then you are probably bi - problem solved.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> so u had sex with him???
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> No, what really matters is, how mature a person is I think!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> I already asked this question once and it had some really great answers!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> U CAN JUST DEAL WITH IT
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Yeh it's normal but if i were u, i'd leave it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> I love singing that song around my wife to tease her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Back away from the boy- he will only lead you to trouble!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> If you do, am goig to get you laid real quick baby!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I dont even like readers digest.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> GET OFF THE COMPUTER AND GO LOOK FOR BOYS IN YOUR CITY,STATE.......... .
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> do you know i exist or love me?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> of course a guy can be honest, different and loving
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> yeah it is hard to hear but i dont think you should carry on.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> just find another guy for you im sure theres someone waiting for you dont let your friendship broken
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> Look other guy ... so many guys!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> of course there is sometimes right where u wouldn't expect
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> its not something you should have to think about.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> i think it's just about equal.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> (this is of course a good time to really ask her).
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> but if i dont find a connection i'd date
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> what hav u got to lose anyway.

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> you must trust each other 100% there is no 99.9% it wont work.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> TELL YOUR FRIEND YOU'RE MOVING IN, and that he should back off a little with specifics to her..
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_35> I've never cheated on a girl.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> look if she anit given it up and you dont want to wait fine.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Dear dont ruin ur life ..
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> (That is if you still want it)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Go to school, travel, date, have fun.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> I was married, I had the chance, no string attached,more than once, and I didn't.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> kep all options open and dont narrow it to one race
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_25> but make ssure mom is willing work with that .
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> I don't understand what you are trying to ask..Thx
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> i am currently in a similar situation plus their was infidelity on my husbands part.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> yes you will if u and your husband settle down, in a proper way.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> think of her favourite things to do and her favourite food.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> if is not working out why beat a death horse go for it
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> everthing had to come to an end and a girl will eventually come up.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Just go out there and be yourself!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> 24 / 1.66 = 14.4, so you are 1.66 times older than a 14-year old.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Don't let them get you down.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> just notice girls around u and talk to them.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> I had a friend who had that happen to her sister.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> there really is no way to justify incest.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> cuz it is fun fun fun!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> you cant stay because of your kids, not with a man like that.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> You can hace a 2 inch penis and if its worked right it can feel good!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> if he only acts like that around you, of corse!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> i lost my virginity at 17. it just gets weird when your a 40-year-old virgin living in mommy's basement.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Yes, cocky and funny works for women, too ... be confident
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> just because you think about them it does not means you love it could just be lust
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> make it worth it to her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> think about what is best for your child and if you want that kind of influence in their life.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> SOme one like that is no good to your kids hon.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Or are there guys out there that want the samr thing?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> u love someone and yet you dont know why do you like her,,, ryt?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> and yet they keep going on?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> U know it all depends on the individual, how u feel ie.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> If he loves you he won't do it again.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> go to askmen.com...you will find everything you need to know(the hands-on experience is up to you)
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> Do yourself a favor and WAIT!!!!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> if she says yes then go for it but use protection.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Because men aren't wired that way...women are.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> no but most are  No one can ever really replace your mother
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Well I'm sure if you flirt with her and things of that nature.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> we aren't.. just clean your ears out and listen, for once!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> I'd go for an IPOD or MPIO
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> so no try to have self control unless your marriage is over.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> Play it the right way, and trust me, it works.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> i dont want my first time to be with some girl i dont even like.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> well it depends what kinda of girl.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> THIS IS A TELL TALE SIGN THAT YOU ARE NOT REALLY IN LOVE.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> tell him you like him, he won't feel shy no longer!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> No if the one you involved doesn't mind you sleep with other people
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> wat do guys want from us, do u just want a girlfriend or for other reasons...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> I think you know what I mean.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> 6 months is not that long.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> have u lived with her for over 2to3yrs?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> and now because you are not satisfied it bothers you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> SPEAKING AS SOMEONE WHO HAS EXPERIENCED THIS WITH FRIENDS AND FIRST HAND...RUN...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Might even be nice if she decided it was a 50/50 kinda thing.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> So what was it for you that made the sparks fly and you know LOVE had slapped you?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Good luck and keep your head up.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> OK that means just try it.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> girls gotta do what they gotta do.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> it will not work like that.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> No it is not related at all LOL
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> love may be staring you in the face and you not even know it.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> but it just depends how devoted and what the husbands wants her devoted to.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> A note on younger users use of English: f u can read this thn u _stand.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> Is it wrong to date her?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Sometimes you just have to take a chance and let fate run its course.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> go close to girl and ask same question to her.
<NbChars_255> <LevSim_25> first find out if she's gay.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> there were also 2 guys sitting on either side of me buying my drinks.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> you should say no, thanks honey.

<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> Whatever you do, make sure you both have fun, and that *she* is the one thinking about sex/love/romance/whatever.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> take him to court and make him pay money
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> For all those virgins in the world,  SAY IT LOUD, SAY IT PROUD!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> we were both raised totally diff.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Wait, that's what I do...at 30!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> my question to you is, where are you looking ?!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> u can do the fon thing but y get so caught up when yall not n the same state?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> No none they are all jerks I thought I found one and then realized he is like the rest!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> and tell his u can't live without Him.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> Attractive/Popular guys only like skinny girls.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> Well, yes you are wrong for getting mad.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> however if they don't it might mean the friendship will never be the same anymore.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Yeah, it does suck to be lonely but you are only 6 months out.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> A favorite CD, or a T-shirt.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> most girls think that bigger is better, but they are only saying that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Share your faith with others and don't care what they think about you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> i don't suppose there's a right or wrong age.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> And duh, power is sexy too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> we are not lesbians we r just bisexual but we like each other alot!we been together for 4 months!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Because they're supposed to be taboo, hands off!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> Add it up & see if you come up with the same answer ok!!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> of course-i wish the guy who liked me would ask me out
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> but do all guys like only the gurls who r skinny?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> how about meet some boys for a change.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> what makes youask that kind of q?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> the man is imagining her nude.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Some never do and just have to start fresh with someone else or never ever remarry.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> I have a tendency want guys that I can't have and it's driving me crazy!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Never forget to tell her  I love you!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> (there is no defense in all kind of divorce even if he refuse to sign).
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Really popular guys don't HAVE to get to know your personality...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> its a good thing i mean if u like someone the color of there skin shouldnt matter at all
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> don't worry bout the feeling or else u won't enjoy the relationship.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> yOU WOULD SURE KNOW IF YOU HAD IT ON BACKWARDS OR UPSIDE DOWN.I GUESS

<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> I NEVER ONCE CHOSE TO BE A LESBIAN.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> is it weird that i want to talk on the phone now that we are in diff states?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> maybe but I wouldnt take that chance and dont talk because he most likly wont talk about it
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I want to know what it is that is so great that they want you so bad?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> but it is a thing of the past .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> If he throws you around...literally....then get rid of him period.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Ask yourself again - is it worthy?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> If she cannot respect you enough not to do that then do not hang out with her anymore..
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> Somebody who has your back when your down.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> - If not maybe he needs some kind of 'release'!)
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_50> Some people think feet sexy, others hair.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> Test him if he really loves you too.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> i feel just the same guy !!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Okay -  It is sad that some people miss out on the LOVE.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> You ask her for here phone #.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> she cares about and mantains husband, work, kids, household, money, and everything else that life hands you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> just be freinds with both of them make sure that girl you like knows your alive.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> maybe then you will have more fun.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> there are alot of dating sites out there.. try myspace maybe you can find someone close to you there...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> yes, and it ruined 5 years of my life.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> you'll know when you find it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> )40 to 50 we spend trying to re-live our youth.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> But life is not like that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> so always feel the most attractive one is your life partner.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> trust me god will take care of it all.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> Move on and don't look back.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_20> whatever, lol) to reproduce and it's not just about sex.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> If he is pessuring u into it though get out of there!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> I WOULD LIKE TO THANK EVERYONE WHO DIDNT JUDGE ME FOR HAVING A FIANCE IN JAIL.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> Essentially you are a fall back...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> I always wondered what made them that way?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> if you don't know you shouldn't be doing it
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> but if you still like him and you don't hate his guts.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> if he's worth it... he'll ask you out.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Make your life as good as you can without him & then add him, NOT ALL THE TIME!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> YES NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT IT........ITS A SIN!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Good luck and cudos for trying to better yourself!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> we feel glad, sad, restless and all those stuff.

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> a perfume.. so dat u can come close to him always
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> My friends liked the same guy and they didn't fight or anything!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> i remember i read somewhere that chocolates usually mean you are only in the relationship for a short time!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Now I'm addicted to yahoo answers.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> you asking if it is ia sin means you are a christian.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> straight and im proud to say it
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> do thing together and making love..   one of the reason a person cheat ..
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> most yes, but some men(like myself) actually likes a relationship.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> either you have some thing stuck on your face from breakfast  or you are totally hot
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> men & women have needs..different needs and get satisfied in one way or another.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> I told her that my friend and I are like brother and sister.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Did your buddies put you up to this???
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> present him with this list.. your (future) marriage can't work if you feel that you are being disrespected...
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_20> Just do it, like a band-aid--right off.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> I don't care what anyone else thinks, I have just made a decision for me where I am.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> im still trying to figure that 1 out myself!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> then do it, if you waant to, just be careful.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> so if you like someone take a chance and get to know them, talk, have fun.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> IS THIS A JOKE OR SOMETHIN'!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> yes but are you just what you described.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> hey baby, i lost my phone number can i have yours?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Anyway, gay guys are so much fun.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_10> BUT NO MATTER WHAT YOU SHOULD NEVER LEAVE YOUR CHILREN!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Then go find someone who will be GOOD to you!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> YOU USE IT AS A WEPONE AGAINST HIM AND HE RUNS TO SOMEONE ELSE FOR SHELTER.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> you obviously arent that cool if you seriously have to think about it
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> very risky unless you want to go halfs on a kid
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> People you just talk to to talk are aquaintinces!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> Hope your ma doesn't find out!

<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> i am having some serious issues with my fiace.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> a strippers club or the gay man association for losers
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> ok you knew she had already been with someone before you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> You grow to love someone you lusted after
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> so plz ppl answer my question

<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> It's not fair but it is a chance that you would be taking.

<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> tell me solution to i  get my love ?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> and is this a serious question???????????
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> i mean they all at one point of their lives cheat on ther galfriends/wives?
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_30> Please don't choose to be Gay!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> secondly, this doesn't do much for people who would rather not believe in the 'seven year itch'.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_40> Treat it like a death of a friend.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> hmmm.....  1) have A LOT of friends?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> Choose the girl that is the most fun to be with and don't worry about the looks.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> IM STILL NOT SURE BUT IT WASNT HIM.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> If he doesn't realize what a great catch you are, it's his ****ing problem... Slam the door on him...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Nothing is wrong with being friends with other girls!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> DON'T KNOW!BUT I DO KNOW THIS......IF AN INDIVIDUAL IS GAY THEY CHOOSE TO BE THEY'RE NOT BORN THAT WAY!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> I believe that it would not be embarrassing if you will just hug him and say nothing...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> you say that love/friendship would be a much needed addition--just don't jump after this guy right away.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> tell him JUST Friends and keep it just friends
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> (like still living with you PARENTS!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> if  you  have  an   answer  send  me  a  message.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> As a man, I'll tell you this...give the ring back!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> to me that says alot about her personality period .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> It is great that you found somebody to care about!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> If you like it and it won't bring back bad memories keep it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> when you are having crazy sex getting bit is good keep it up
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> I'M NOT OVERLY PROTECTIVE, JEALOUS, ETC...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> *sigh* Of course i said yes and well...the rest is definately personal!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> So i make that I keep my mouth shut.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> But that's pretty drastic at this point.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> BECAUSE U TOUCH YOUR SELF AT NIGHT
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> welcome to the club......I got jackets
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> It is wrong to have sex with them!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> hes still shy to talk to about these things
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> Females - hardly worth the time it takes to blow a load.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> yes cause it will come back and bite you in the ass!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> It worked for me - my neighbor wants me (2 diffenret neoghbors, 2 different times!)
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> If so, then you truly love her.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> watch movies with sex in it to get experience
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> i heard it was because we(black men) have the best candy shop(third leg[between the legs])
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> if he stares at you that probably means he thinks you look beautiful.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> there is no way its b/c they were born that way!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> i started to read a couple of pages, it seems funny but kinda sad.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> it would be a big help if you did!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> He's probably with my baby mama!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> of course it has to be the right time...place...etc.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> If you like her - go ahead!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> Guys should know not to mess w/ my girl.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> The men who cheat are dirtbags!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> meaning going against your religion and teachings.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> oh and your vows said for better or worse.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> why do you care anyway !
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> is it wrong that we did that w/the age diff?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> should i wait for something between her and her boyfriend to go wrong...or should i try to move on?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> if he acts different around you, maybe gets shy or gets more outgoing.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> do we really get over relationships , especially of that length!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> try moving to japan...maybe there are some decent guys there
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> i know how you feel   and i dont know either
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> I really just think that it is a guy thing.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> infact ive dated most of the asian races except korean.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> do whatever he likes but not to the extent u put your self down.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> What I don't like is a stiff kisser.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> honey everybody judges whether it's good or bad.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> A friend who will love you no matter what and always be there for you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> love is blind so goes the old adage.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> plus he always stares at me.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Well, thats the rumor any way.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> no she is a big fat skank
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> WHY wait for him to call you...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> women are asking the smae thing about men...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> just think of this... the only thing you know is what you have been around.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> AND WHEN I SEE A BLACK MAN WITH A WHITE WOMAN, I ASSUME THAT'S HIS PREFERENCE, AND HE'S HAPPY.

<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> ), do things together that she enjoys.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> also, black men suppoedly have bigger ding-dongs.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> dreams are the window to your subconscience.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> ask her out and tell your friend to chill on the flirting when you going with her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> And that ain't cool at all!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> I really like this guy and we always catch each other looking at each other what can i do?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> You are friends and then you become lovers.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> i bet she´ll go nutz for you and willing to have you on bed all night long.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> 'not desperate' but basically anything the girl could think of...ANYTHING!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> So should i IM him, or would that be kinda stalkerish?

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i know exactly what you mean.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> it is cheating if you beleive in what you said in  christian marriage vows.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> This is a tough one, if you really like him that much,.... go for it !

<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> first of all, use the spell check.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> anyway, mine was when i was about 16.  cheers.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> when he tries to make excuses on talking to you....and get close to you
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Most guys don't really hear a single word a lady says until they see her naked .
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> big balls hurt more when you get kicked in the groin.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> THAT DEPENDS ON HOW THE 2 OF YOU CAN HADDLE IT.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> should i carry on with the relationship?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> This guy for one prefers girls who have some meat on them
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> what do you have to lose anyway, it just means shes not the one.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> this definitely will solve your problem
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> she really knows the true... or ...
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> cuz guys are so used to frontin and tryin to fit the mold
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> I guess not...  Have you tried marriage counciling?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> jr,  Dude, that's always the tough part, isn't it?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> A love jones is when you can't stop thinking about someone...no matter how hard you try.
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_30> Watch SOUL TRAIN, MTV, rent some dancing videos.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> but for now just tell urself that he won't and if u have any doubt ask him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> well, a lot depends on how old you are, how long you've know him, etc.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> Be wise, think what you wanna do.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> and if he approaches you afterwards, then you know its a hit.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> leave your fly unzipped and dont wear underwear.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> i dont have a problem with it, you dont date someone based on their race.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> don't waste your life on fantasy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> cause there arent many out there
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> But he is getting married this month.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> Then break up and get on with life.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> Just feel with ur own heart.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Of course he always does this for you to make you happy, right?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> Who doesn't want affection from another????
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> laugh at all of his jokes.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> dont let her go because she is once in a blue moon.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> Well thats tough...his friend is your EX right?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> If all becomes weird and your girlfriend turns psycho get a restraining order
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> i  am  a  fe  male  so  i think  guys  would pretty  females  bcuz  just  becus
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> fren·sh fren: a derivative of the english word friend sh: a phoenetic word meaning quiet.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> the other person will then say,  how?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Dude, they are on the internet trying to pick someone up!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> If they make comments, like You sure are quiet then you know you were being too mouthy!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> Tell them to kiss you A** and walk away
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> better to get it out of the way asap.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> ...can ...can you repeat your question please?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> or the lets only please the man.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Get a better one next time around!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> he never liked you, just your body.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> if women can do it, why can't men?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> - Respectful - And everybody pretty much likes me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> You gotta right to be mad.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> no there is no way that you can have a gaurantee that he wont do it again.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> take him aside and tell him how u truly feel
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> coz if u have Brain you are Beautiful!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Legal or  otherwise that should not even be something to think about...cheating is wrong
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> you never know...she may be the one.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Just don't waste your life for things that can't make you happy.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> look at my bio and history please
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> this is one of those situations that LIFE throws @ you, you will always ask yourself i wonder,i wonder.....?????
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_45> I am not married but I am a cheater....so I'm kinda on the fence with this one.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> Make them really, really good (and semi-obvious) hints because remember, guys are really dumb about things like this.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> Don't mix work w/ pleasure it equals trouble in the long run.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> i dont go for all just looks, but to be honest, everyone wants an attractive female by their side
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> I just don't really know about the law .
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> if he don't like it tell him to get the f*** own.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> Srry not married and savin it for then.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> if it was the end of the world....   Yeah >.>
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> not too big, not too small!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> If he is paying for porn he has a problem.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Most women hate chessy pick up lines and find it insulting when a guy says them.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> They already know, or they wouldn't be wondering.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> she loves you and can not live without you but who am i to say
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> if she does then she cant sleep with other man.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> In other words don't cater to All their wants & desires.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> i know it's hard trust me (bin there done that) but ull learn 2 let it go.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Just relax, have fun and enjoy yourself.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> i am divorced w/3 kids he is married w/1.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> how long have u know this person?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> it's a nice way of saying later baby
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Do you want to spend the rest of your life with this woman?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> when you dont think about your self anymore and you only think about what the other person wants,likes,feels,thinks!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> Love is like wine, it matures as it ages.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> But after all What a woman wants is most of the time just what they end up with!!!huh!!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> Save it for later when you've lived and you won't regret it!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> can anyone tell me what can i do my husband wants to kill me.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> been on a few, and to congested just wanna meet others
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> If she is looking at you everyday.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> just be your self and don't be scared of rejection.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> This is not a guy problem, it's a people problem.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Oh, and kinda weird point here, but mention if you own a hoodie or not, please!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> if your bf wanted to have sex you should do it i want a gf who is fun smart
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> my experents is u really don't know some body till u live with them.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> there isn't anything wrong with you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> if you break up it will ruin your friendship.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> I think it's pretty dumb they still do that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> I also dont wanna fuck up freindship.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> (just kidding - dont be so serious all the time!)
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> if u are already friends with her, otherwise no.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> If you haven't found that special man yet you will, you seem like that kind of girl!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> Be nice to him...he'll probably be your boss someday.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> This doesnt sound right does it????
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> Hey man, if you like her, you like her.

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> I used to be addicted to porn.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> You'd have to be pretty dense not to.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> guys with girlfriends (and wives) are always more appealing.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> who said that yes we do understand
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> its the best  worth the money read it together it guarantees  a reward!!

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Not sure if he's dad was like that when he was growing up.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> LMAO they probably cheat cause they aren't happy or they're just dirtbags lol
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Well i would suggest to ask yourself 2 questions:  1) Whom do you prefer having sex with?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> as all good things that is hard to find.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> ooohh... its awful...the guy is the butt of all the jokes that day.

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> You already know what to give him and i know that it is good.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> wow sounds like you have a active night life here.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> The biggest reason is because guys put up a front so you think they are so awesome and stuff.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> because girls get worried really easy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Limp most of the time lol
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> i'm not young anymore this year i'm 30 and my bf is 35.

<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> I would never ask this in person!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> moderately talkative and moderately humble...if i had one choice though, i would say talkative!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> 6 months is really no time at all.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> if don't want to then don't.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> honestly, start a rumor that you like him.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> too bad, maybe she is fat after all!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> He wrote me some pretty good stuff.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> i have incountered this , and it makes me irate !
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> get over it and find someone better.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> yeah i love talkative girls a lot but humble girls are quite simple...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> no  some man prefer sex with only with thier own wife.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> *) It takes a LONG time to get used to it - and be honest with the children.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Try to catch her without her girls, BUT when she is in the public eye still!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> get comfterbale relax and talk about it
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Slap him in the face and then RUN.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> DONT DOUBT IT AND DONT SETTLE.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> when you love somebody you do Anthing for them
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> Absolutely, that is the purpose of valentines day!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> - For example I used to have a crush on this one guy...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> so you think you're in love with your best friend, huh?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> come on yaar...it is legal too .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Have you ever talked to her about her past relationship w/ the guy?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> hope that helped you a bit.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> How can i go out with him?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> And yes I am in 6th Grade!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> That was when I was 30 years old!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> b a good friend and do the right thing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> If you're anything like me, you'll do anything for your kids...well, here's the first BIG test.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> if you don't approve of spanking, try time out!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Actually i believe in love at first sight, but that doesn't mean its meant to last.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> SO IF YOU LOVE HIM SO MUCH TIME HIM TO GETS SOME HELP BEFORE ITS TO LATE!.........
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> Now many years later (I'm 33), my parents still hate each other !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> WOULDNT YOU WANT SOMEONE TO LOVE YOU?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> -- says the 14 year old.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Sneak around and read the messages!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> And I doubt he ever will.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> A lot of girls find a brave guy to be very sexy
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> he dribbles... he shoots... he scores... 2 points...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> I JUST DON'T THINK THERES HOPE.....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> how honest u are ......a  girl who always gives priority to him than any thing else...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I'd have to get to know him better, he might be a sex freak, for all I know.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> I mean how do I become a friend until they break up?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> You know all the good stuff!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> it means u need to take a visit to the hospital.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> shes not blood related so go out with her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> Are these true, that once he/she has cheated on you once before, that he/she will always do it??
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> Yeah, if he's always got girls hitting on him, he's probably a player.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> I worked out at the gym and ran on the beach.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> i dont think ur the father type anyway.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> There are lots of happy, hooked up big girls.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> you start talking with women, then you will have clear picture abt the woman's nature.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> i hope you can find a way!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> well the big questions is.. do you like the other girl?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> i now that i love him but im not attracted to him at all.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> my husband has a tender heart but he right down childish always about him all the time.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> yes, even if a relationship didn't go well, that doesn't mean it all has to be over!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> when she her close her eyes
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> It's better to be friends then enemies...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> yeah it might be the age thing now.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> only if your life depended on it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> that what happen to my friend on las vegas know that is funny
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> well  just avoid them stop calling or texting... they shud get the idea...  sum  gul  do me dat  lol...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> its complicated cause the girl you might want might not want you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> it has set me free in a way i never knew.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> some1 help me with thing that means u 2 guys and girls can help 2!!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> I say both are too young.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> it really hurt me and i dont know how to tell him.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_30> So can you love at 15?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> I dont thin short guys are sexy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> I didn't think there were any good men left!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> You better leave this woman, I'm telling ya...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> But not really out loud, more like a chukkle or two inside my mind...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> ITS NOT LIKE YOU CAN HIDE FOREVER.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> women that have big hips have babies easier for some reason but don't ask me
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> She'll get off your back or change your phone number!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> yeah it feels good, but of course there might be some side affects to it, so just think about
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I hope i always have boyfriends and girlfriends.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> 3 is the most for me
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> what else can you  call it!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> no matter wat u give him, he'll still know that u love him, just try to be romantic.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> IT TAKES A STRONG WOMAN TO STAND BY A MAN LIKE THIS.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> he dribbles... he shoots... he scores... 2 points...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> just set him free and dont question him much.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.I ALSO HAVE FOUGHT SO HARD TO WHERE I AM.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> then go home and be with your family.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Same way that you did before.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Just go and beat the guy you hated so much and warn him.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> if that doesnt work then just ignore it.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> if u really love him then it's alright
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> What is worse -- Being a lone or be a lone and being cheated on ?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> so choices are many but take the right ones
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> Have some fun and take this other guy for a spin.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> hey my name is___ and you are?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> walk right up to him before someone else does and just say it to him...just do it.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> live it to the fullest even if he is 48. live, laugh, and love
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> you spend too much time with her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_90> depends on how tired they are
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> How old are you and have you two dated at all?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> if ur askin this question ur sh*t outa luck pal
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> be honest tell him face to face
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> it might be haha why dont you ask your father?LOL!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> what your crazy that to young to have sex, even to young to think about it
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> if you don't that could not end pretty.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> look at it from your reinds point of veiw.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> she cant get mad at you if you didnt do anything.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> she is hot and want to use her body for meaningless sex   she is cheap
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> You can have tons of friends, why ur ex?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> Just talk about whatever comes to mind, be yourself and dont try so hard.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> b/c when you think you in love no one can tell otherwise, you see what you wanna see.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> I still love him and want him to know this because I want him bak!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_60> I think its best if you just move on.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> I guess you just tell them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> they can barely tell a grl tat they like her
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> You basically knows what your woman like and the kind of things she likes to do.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> A fun way...hmmm....try one of my personal favs of asking a lady out: poetry.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> DON'T give him your phone number, DON'T speak to him at all!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> they can't deal with things like that.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_10> THERE ARE WOMEN EVERYWHERE THAT ARE MARRIED OR SINGLE TRY THE INTERNET YOU WILL FIND YOUR ANSWERS THERE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> they like to hear stuff like you are so funny and you are so nice
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> Later the answere will be selected through voting
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> coz the only part which beets fast when u r happy and beet slow when u r sad
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> I don't think the age difference is a problem (I am 26), but office romance can get very sticky...
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> since i hardly know that person.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> this kind of feeling is not love it's just attraction and lust,
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> You Go Right To Bed... And stay there for a few Days...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> No my wifes got small boobs and I love them, accually I really dont like the huge ones.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_5> ANY MAN WHO SAYS YOU ARE OVER REACTING IS AVOIDING- YOU ARE INDEED REACTING TO SOMETHING.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> I think they be fucking on the side.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> you will know when it happens
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> wait for a lil while before you try to get over them.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> I totally agree with Catnip as best answer so far.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> What women does not like roses?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> try spencers.com they have some good stuff right there!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Depends,If he realy loved the girl or not.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> She shouldn't freak out since she STARTED it.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_60> If not, I would not marry him.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> They think with one brain the one below the belt.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> iam ivan jay iwant know about girls heart please tell about girls .thank you
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> think about it, u like him, he likes u, what can be better?
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> Once a cheater, always a cheater.
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_35> Not as your boss liking you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Just take it easy and maybe she will come around.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> just wanted s friend to talk to.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> it is so hard to watch someone you love go through this from begining to end so stay strong!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> ohh and try explaining to ur mom
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> you should kiss her when you feel the time is right thats the best way ok!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> just date around and you will find it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> 8 and under: If he throws dirt at you he likes ya!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> I FELT IF I HAD LEFT FOR GOOD HE WOULDNT OF HAD A MOTIVE TO CHANGE FOR THE BETTER.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Just be yourself...go out & have fun together.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> should i forget the kiss or persue more.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> i'm also 16 and it works.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> DONT GIVE HER ANYTHING GET A DIVORCE LAWYWER NOW.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> you could but you shouldnt 9 is way to young .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> In retrospect, like a wise man once said Don't hate the player, hate the game!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> I hope everything works out for u
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> i dont talk that much so it's about 15 egyptian pound a mouth that's about 3 dollers :D
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> IF YOU WHANT THAT STUFF GET MARRIED!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> and some nice stylish jeans but no holes in either!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> but if i was a girl i would not say yes.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> but when me and my wife have sex it is the best just because we comunicate with each other.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_10> HONESTY SINCERETY BUT ONLY IF LOOKING FOR A LONG TERM MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I don't believe in casual dating either.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_10> AND THE EMAILS ARE NOT YOUR IMAGINATION,  DO YOU NEED TO BE HIT OVER THE HEAD.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> i think that the heart sees what it wants.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> I HAVE GONE THRU SO MUCH,AND FOR PEOPLE TO JUDGE YOU BY YOUR AGE.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> It's gonna hurt and your not gonna find much support as the man.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> i asked why he does it and he say aint i with you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Of course, I don't believe in casual dating, either.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> YES IT DEPENDS OF WHAT DOES THAT 15 YAER OLD PERSON FEEL.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> But be careful, marriage is a big commintment.. Have a nice life with lucky someone!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> My male best friend got in love with me, I didn't love him.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Both of you have to be willing to do this.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It surprised me at first, but after awhile...I got used to it.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> but they will not stab you in the back.. by the way you are awesome...totally awesome...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> you certainly dont look ready, if u were, u would not be asking questions
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> your best bet is to read a few books and be totally honest with your counciler.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> make your boob's bigger and shake your money maker in there face at the local strip club!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> I walk and walk and think.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> iN MY HOUSE, MY DAD DID ALL THE YELLING AND SPANKING AND MY MOM DID ALL THE COMFORTING.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> there aren't that many girls like that that rn't sluts.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> Don't worry, your time will come.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> wait for him to call you
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> it sounds like ridiclous head games.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> I actually don't believe in dating while in school.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> If you do not drink, it prob.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> She's probably 8 years old, or just acting stupid, alot of people ask dumb questions on here.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> if your a boy who likes boys or a girl who likes girls
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> the max (to me) is about 6'2 er so
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> AND 99% OF THE TIME THEY DO FORGIVE THEM ONLY TO HAVE IT DONE TO THEM AGAIN.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> But i tell you what, it is the most fulfilling experience!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> if your a boy who likes boys or a girl who likes girls
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> the max (to me) is about 6'2 er so
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> AND 99% OF THE TIME THEY DO FORGIVE THEM ONLY TO HAVE IT DONE TO THEM AGAIN.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> I really  realy hope so , im small too ;)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> get a shrink and do all the women a favor and never contact them again!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Not if he is happy and the relationship is working out.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> As far as the hubby goes...let it go.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> Let's say you just got together with a guy.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Maybe he's just jealous or something.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> if it were me, i would do it!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> so just play by your instinct
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> i would say around one or one and 1&#92;2
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Why couldn't you just tell him?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> What is she getting out of it?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Get a life and wait some more.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> AND ME AND HIM WANNA GET BACK WITH EACH OTHER WHAT DO YOU THINK
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> YOU SHOULD TELL HER BEFORE SHE STARTS TO LIKE YOU MORE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> I EVENTUALLY LEFT HIM AND TOLD HIM THAT I COULDNT AND WOULDNT DEAL WITH IT.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> im probably going to be chewed for this.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> dating here starts at a much later age than elsewhere.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> i dont live there but i have been there many times to the bad lands
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> that sounds like the worst kind of cheating.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> maybe george didnt stop loving you, maybe you abandoned george long ago.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> grass is always greener on the other side.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_10> ALWAYS LOVE YOURSELF MORE THAN ANY OTHER!!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> Or I say, this is my mistress or she says gentleman-lover.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> You gave this man 8 years of your life and for what....excuses....move on sweety
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_45> as u say other's have commented u on it!
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_35> Try asking him if he has seen, or wants to see  a certain movie that is playing.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> He would have been serious with you if he wanted you for a girlfriend.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Try asking him if he has seen, or wants to see  a certain movie that is playing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> He would have been serious with you if he wanted you for a girlfriend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> because saddly with an affair there are lies, and half truths by both of you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> because you do...read answer to your last question.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I flirt with women but I am only playing and my wife knows about it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> What if you DO lose him???
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Personally i prefer a nice fitting t-shirt (not a huge one that is like a blanket!!)
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> you have to be kidding RIGHT !
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> a boy named the same thing goes to my school- westbrook?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> YOU WOMEN ARE TO SMART SOME TIMES
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_40> If u can't pick one,then neither is right for u.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> k well u really can't go up to anytype of girl.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> i m wathing hi school musical right now
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> Should I move on or try it with my ex again?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> but if not don't waste your time.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> In a booth at tgi fridays
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> sicko get a life  thats just WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> no, as long as they are seen by your man or women
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Walk The Line with Reese Witherspoon!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> should have think twice before breaking up!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> call him up inl ike a month and be like 'hey wuts up?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> My boyfriend says it was all innocent
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> i want 2 be his gf, but i don't want 2 ruin the frendship with my friends.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> I've been with my boyfriend for >EIGHT YEARS<!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> It's just the way men (and women) are.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> You went out with her because you cared for her.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> if you are both still young i would say longer...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> She'll either laff or jump on ya.
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_25> i am 10 so shut up.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> I DON'T THINK I LOOK 2 BAD, I RESPECT AND TREAT LADIES VERY GOOD.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> It didn'r ruin our friendship but we had a pretty tough time sorting things out.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Get yourself better and move on.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> just take ur time organised dinner or date just break the news there is no two way abt that.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_10> LOOK..MY DAD (47) GOT MARRIED TO A 25 YR OLD YOUNG SLUT.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> Ive reconnected with alot of my friends .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Oh, and no, you're not an idiot for wanting that.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> i know he loves me, but after 5 yrs i want a commentment
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> I can't find any good guys around here.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> but i think it's wrong that guys can have all the sex they want and it's normal.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> but personally i have found a guy that can keep up with me.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> because they think they can get away with it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> rule number one you cant make people like you.

<NbChars_40> <LevSim_20> maybe..... i think you guys are totally rushing it too....
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Because they aren't truely a best friend.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> in one of those study booths at the library at university
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_10> BUT HE HAS ABOUT LOST HIS BUSINESS AND HIS HOUSE AND EVERYTHING FINACIALLY .
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> would you move on or would you hang in there for a while longer hoping.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> maybe because you are together for too long time :)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> I would lose my shit if I were that guy.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Eventually the big ones just lay there like a pair of dead ol beaver tails.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> to take ur honesty from u. be smart and keep it up!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> she'll be bowled over!and if she likes u too then u r the happiest man on the world!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> Of course you should be friends.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> Just tell them you are straight!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Wear that special dress and do your hair up nice!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> I don't suggest using it though.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> Should C be told she misunderstood D?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I don't think your over reacting at all!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> if she knows the truth, she'll actually know what the problem was, and the huge mistake she made!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> whippings ARE too harsh but a swat on the butt otr the hand isn't!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> You can't just keep taking, something has got to give ...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> when he avoids u, avoid him dont look for him.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> You are a real person with real emotions!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> No I say , this is my woman-friend and I am her man-friend.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> My answer to this question is ADULTS ONLY  Barbie N
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> girls can be hypersensitive, and boys don't understand why.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> If she says no then it wasn't meant to be.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> try antonio banderas-spirit...is cool,but don't use too much
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> whatever, give the girl a chance.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> but remember any good friend never do this to his/her friend.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> Tell him he picked a whore.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> She likes having sex with many different guys.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> once rested, then you can let the good times roll!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> and if he c**s  - you did it right!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> i personally think that women have a much higher sex drive than men.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> if tell the people shut the FUCK up.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> the truth is they want a little bit of both
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> I think it will still be PARIS...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> your looking in the wrong places.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> You can do this...you have it in you!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> i REALLY dont think thats likely.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> that means that he really likes you.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> first of all...how is he considered your boyfriend?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Lesbians I can tolerate, they don't seem so gross to me.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Not all men are like this though.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> if you enjoy wearing dipers, keep wearing them FOREVER!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> because it seems boys have different rules than we do...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> if you have 4 women that you can hang out with why are you asking questions on yahoo.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> I ready and he ready because we both play field and realize what true love is.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> try Stuart Florida, west palm beach that area
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Stop and think about how youd feel if your mans ex-women and him were still e-mailing each other!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> ALSO, WHY DID YOU SLEEP WITH YOUR BESTFRIEND AND YOU CAN'T EVEN TELL HIM.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> all the guys i like r taken n nobodys ever asked me out...i m not desperate, happily single,just curious
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> or go w/ the best kittie cat .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> move on and get with him if he CRAWLS begging back to you if youre still interested
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> seek marriage counseling,2 wrongs don't make one right.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> He might say no, but big deal!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Now you need to ask yourself why you don't trust her?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Forget cheating, dating a criminal is worse!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> 600,000 might be a bit too many!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Remeber that and have fun you are only young once.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> If it doesn't work out, then ask if you can go back to being friends.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> you are too young to be with her in the first place you need to get away from her
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> If he doesn't want the package deal to move on.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> yes if both of you are active and adventurous...you just need a lot of lubricant
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> If you just broke up it'll be awkward for both of you for awhile.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> if you love your husband you can not do it with any one else.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> threw an afternoon party, invite your future gf.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> because i even got into the situation (which was months ago), our friendship is still on very thin ice.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> u ve a long life to leave y in a hurry
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> try to tell her change her mind+dont approch her very caring but dont let her down
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> It doesn't matter WHERE he gets his appetite as long as he EATS AT HOME!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> well he does thats the way they act
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Not if you're on here all the time!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Get a life and do your homework!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> well, his eyes will tell u.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> i felt so guilty that i was there.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> O.o  in my friends boy roof wit my friends boy woooooo yea u should try it....
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> don't worry the TIME will alert you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> he on the outher hand don't.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Why do so many have to be mean?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> Something gross, if you have to.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> there's nothing special about it if their isn't something in the kiss.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> If so go for it and dont worry .
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> i think in your mid to late 20's your more mature.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> do you really want all that emotional baggage the second time around?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Don't give him an ultimatum either.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> You aint UGLY if you think that you look REAL GOOD 2 me!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Sounds like both of you like living in fantasy land...not reality.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> sand in pizzas.that male organ is for that****** female organ.so use it there.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> i say hold your head up and love with all your heart.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> WHAT WE'RE REALLY LOVING IS THE WAY WE FEEL.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> yeah, I have 2 agree with pagan_earthgirl.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> Sorry, can't stop laughing at Ericmaypother!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> The only way to hook up with the RIGHT girl is to JUST BE YOURSELF.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> Ever shopped @ Tiffany's & Co.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> whatever you do, don't toy with their hearts.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> Some women, like myself loves jewelry.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> If you mean, Should married people have sex?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> maybe but i don't kno u soo i guess not until i kno who u r :)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> if you really love him, hold on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> If not, then either learn to love her quirkiness or find yourself a less outrageous best friend!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> only you can answer thse questions honestly
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> is that what your BF looks like?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> i think its that men and boys tend to think less deeply than girls and women.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> Yeah its better, but it is worth it.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> but i will tell you this look at hot guy yourself.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> I dated a girl from Kazakhstan and we had the hottest dirties sex ever.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> because some girls just are not use to nice guys.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> because most men don't realize a good thing until it is good and gone, men are backwards
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> If that man would actually CHEAT with you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> is bad of u cos u hurt him,well still let him know ur reason in a matual way,
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_30> Try talking to him and get him into rehab!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> Uhhh that took 1 more of those almost extinct brain cells to come up with didn't it LOL
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_35> he acts like he likes me
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> ur family knows and they don't care.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> It may not seem like it now but they really do know what is best for you.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> You damn kids with this boogie jive nonesense, ingnorant as hell!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> Good luck anh have patience with da love thang.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> go dutch when you go out.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> I hate saying this to you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> are you certain that he loves you?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Dont even do it to yourself.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> you have STD and you have sexual smell and malformation problems :P
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> wait for the right person and right moment... probably after 17...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> that's fifteen o's and seven of them were mine!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> fuck her a few more times.... shel quit!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Or, maybe someone got dumped one day when he had bad heart burn ;D
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> in my idea ... is too have someone to love and love you back in return.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_55> if what u like it doesn't matter.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> No they are both to young!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> good luck and i hope things work out for the best!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> Well, I don't but I wouldn't call myself typical.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> just keep it in your mind, not everyone has to be in love and have BF
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> i was 16 ,seems like it lightyears ago and i am only 22
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> u need to wait til she and you r more matured.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> The guy didn' even know I liked him for years!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> stick with him if u believe he is the person for u
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Has he always flirted like this?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> Don't ever go fishing where you work at.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> Good luck dont try so hard!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> i rub money all over my body and i cant keep the women off of me
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> what everybody else says doesn't matter.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> im sure you might just get the response that you want from him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> hell yeah, then slap the ho for thinking she ws gonna keep it!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> And don't chase after too many girls at once, we like to think we're special!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> Ya' did the nasty with him?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> but you should determen how hard you swat/spank them according to their age!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> would u like to know if you were her?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> I FEEL THAT SHE SHOULD KEEP IT,BUT SHE ASKED ME IF I WANTED IT BACK, I SAID NO!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> You don't talk to her during sex, do you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Someone once said that I was a no good crack whore.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> she freaked out because you are 12.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Its not love trey it lonely.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> and teaches women how men think.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Just pull your thingy out in front of her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> No... it's not a drunken bash, it's a wedding.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> WE STILL LIKE HER BETTER EVEN THOE SHE WAS TRICKING US, BECAUSE SHE SUCKERED US WHEN WE WERE YOUNG.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> is there really lust at 1st sight?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> No not always some yes but some no depends on the girl really
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> is there any way you call him and ask him to explain it to you?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> Learn from it and don't be that stupid again.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> he dribbles... he shoots... he scores... 2 points...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> very very very bad to mix business with love.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> be yourself, thats all i have to do, and i have the best friends in the world!
<NbChars_370> <LevSim_15> just have safe sex rest is ok...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> when i met my boyfriend i wasnt even looking for anyone he just came into my life.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> no but Im looking for one
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> First off BE HONEST with both of them .
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> Eat a whole lot of oysters
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Sometimes all us guys want to do is ummm, you know.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> he is a radio personality .
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> I feel confused because i feel between.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> dont make her do anything that she wouldnt want her to.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> na and honestly I wouldn't worry about the labels of gay straight or bi it's all a blur anymore
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> true love is hard to come bye.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> I don't go out with guys, if there's no spark, no oomph.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> i don't want to brake up with him, i love him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> i understand exactly how u feel and my husband cheated alot on me.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> do not be afraid he shouldn't bite...
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> tell em you're straight and if that don't work punch em in the gut and chest gut first.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> i dont really know, but maybe you could try being close friends with him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> Guys like ALL types of girls, you just have to be patient.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> On my parents second story patio facing the main road....with my butt totally exposed.....WHAT A RUSH!!

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> men are men, women are women.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> if it stinks we wont touch it.I personally like pleasing women before i get pleased
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> all i could do was think about my boyfriend.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> do what ever it takes to save the most valuable thing in your life.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> stay there with them at their place for a month or two ... then bring them home with you...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> And what happens when you blow your nose?

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> and i have loved him ever since
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Anything intriguing about her.. something about the way she talks, walks, does something.. anything.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> IT ISN'T ALWAYS US LOVING MEN.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Yes so maybe they get back together
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> #1 think to do is pray!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> its not a big deal, but mostly it makes them feel good about themselves.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> THERES ALWAYS SOMEONE BETTER OUT THERE AND IT'S NEVER TOO LATE.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> Girl, it always works like that.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> they get exactly the gifts and thing they want.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> and try to be funny because everybody loves that.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> DON'T LET HIM KNOW YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH HIM....BIG MISTAKE!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> IF U REALLY LOVE UR GF, U WOULDNT WANT TO CHANGE HER BRITNEY FLORDIA

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Thats how people can find out if ur single.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> But u said tyhere is no middle ground for u,,, it's friends(not seeing eachother) or sex!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> Dont worry this is not true...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> im assuming because thoe omen that are dating the married men really dont want a big comitment
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> he probably likes you but doesnt want his friends to know.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> we broke up and i just want to be friends.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> have fun with all of them and look for the 5th woman she might be the one!

<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> I knew this girl and I really cared about her.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> i guess i always had hope we could be together again, now i know we cant.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> SOME PEOPLE ACTUALLY USE THIS SITE LIKE THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO.
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_30> May be he is not gay... may be he is thinking that he is a gay?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> no such thing on the web.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_15> HE IS EXTRA THRISTY ON YOU,TELL HIM TO BAG BACK.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> ask yourself if you would take a bullet for him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> not scared to do whatever !!!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> I think you sure are gay release and deal
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> because you eather like him or you dont want to she her get hurt.

<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> When emotions are all in our brain...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> i non,t no go fuck my ass
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> the short version: don't do it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> if he does, what are you worried about?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Go to My space.com or Runescape My name is arbitor28 NO SPACES!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> well me personaly i love sports and taking girls out on a date
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> If you still love her, just keep doing that.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> he's awesome and everything, but do i love him?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_15> SO WHAT IF WE LOVE THE FEELINGS, WE ALL BELIEVE IT'S HIM, EVEN HIM.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> well f**k her again u stuck it in once why not make it a second time???
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> i'd have to agree ...he's a loser..and he doesn't deserve you if he likes you...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> IF YOU CAN STILL WAIT.... GOD WILL GIVE YOU THE RIGHT PERSON FOR YOU.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> they hate it when you do it and i betcha he wont do it no more.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> But there should be a whole lot of other stuff going on than just that!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> They dont need to it just feels good so they want it more!!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> YOU NEED TO GIVE GUYS A CHANCE TO GET TO KNOW THEM FOR WHAT THEY ARE.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> tell her what u feel that is what friends r for
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Must be nice....  And us guys get a total of 15 seconds of bliss....  Blahhh
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> MY HUSBAND IS HAPPY BUT WHAT CAN i DO TO MAKE HIM MORE HAPPY?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> friendship is like 2 souls in 1 body.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_20> I HAVE BEEN IN YOUR SHOES.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> even if they don't really know what it means to be bisexual.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Then no matter what u want 2 do - it's all legal.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> on valentine's day do the nasty.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> see if you can find help for her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> for me i talk to my bf everyday.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> they dont want to scew things up
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> do you still believe you will go to hell if you r naughty ??
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> porn is for the weak,unimagitive,and undateable...try counseling
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> But, sad because I wasted so much time (7 years), and angry well, for the obvious.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> THEN SHE WILL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT BLINDED IDIOT MAN.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> hell yah boy it is good for the soul will i love sex so i dont know about u.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> (but i'm not trying to make you feel bad.ok?)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> maybe your having dream about her because you really like her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> let her know you love her and that you care about the relationship that you both have started.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Sure...they have the same sensibility as girls :D
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> Oh...Its a good time to put in a lot of over time too.....Always Forward
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> 12 and under: If you ever pass him a note and he writes back, he likes ya!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> a friend is someone special, someone who you can tell everything.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_15> BUT THE FALLING IN LOVE I'M THINKING ABOUT( NO!)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> think of all good years that you 2 has shair.
<NbChars_330> <LevSim_20> spice it up is my opinion.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_45> as long as you are 17 or over
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> its hard to want to be around someone that mopes around all day not doing any thing.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> it depends on how good the girls is
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> Personally I love a guy in a suit
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> But my boyfriend thinks that I still have feelings for him.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> you can find boys easily but not friends
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> think of it,most guys these days r afraid of a bit of competition.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Someone please help me out with this!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> Just be yourself and have fun!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_55> or u could make the toss up.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_35> 2 b w/ 4 women u gotsa b a player??
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> Come on girl... you can do better!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> just grab his hand and if he doesnt like it dump him because that means he doesnt like you
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> you been watching too many porn movies!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> i had it happen to me.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> he didn't say that he loves you so i wouldn't jump to conclusions.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> THEN HE REALIZED THAT ALL DRUGS DO IS TAKE YOU DOWNHILL.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no, some guys love them because the cute and perky and dont get in the way
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> those verizon stands at the mall sell all kinds, i'm sure u could find wat u need there
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> i would say about 2 years after they learn to talk
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_20> - Goodness gracious great balls of fire...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> It varies--some asian girls are VERY hot, but some aren`t.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> they don't have money to buy a larger bra, i guess.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> kiss yourself in a mirror first to get a field of it then try it on her
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_40> where is he and why ?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> He'll wonder all day whats up!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> You're a jerk and a loser.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> take a drive down the road and pick up a hooker
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> Try as much as u can to avoid some if not all, the things that leads to the problem.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> you were probably good friends in the beginning, don't lose it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> another fun idea is riding snowmobiles/4 wheelers.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> YES U SHOULD CUZ THATS NOT RIGHT COMING FROM BOTH OF THEM.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> I just don't feel very comfortable when I know a person is gay.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> then it will mean more to him and to you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Most guys are oblivious if girls like them, so just go for it girl!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_10> LOVE LAST INFATUATION IS SHORT TERM.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> after class he walks me to my car...carries my stuff
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> sometimes they do it just depends on how soft the guy is.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> a friend is some one that is alwayz there 4 u wether its when ur sad,happy,deppresed,or crying
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> Quit beating yourself up and GO ASK HIM OUT!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> THIS QUESTION IS IN THE COMPLETELY WRONG EFFING CATEGORY AND YOU SHOULD PUT IT RIGHT.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> well think about the reason you and ex broke up in the first place?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> THIS MIGHT COME AS A SHOCK BUT YOUR MOM HAS A RIGHT TO FREAK.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> go for it... yo dont have anything to lose
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> 2) If you had an affair then you need a clean break.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> It's like you can't explain it.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> if he loves you dont worry about it.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> change ur #  she'll get the it eventually.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> chat... yahoo chat has started considering age for allowin users to some features.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> go out with friends that make youlaugh  Good Luck
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> he's probably cheating or else depressed!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> I really like a gf who is working with me!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> I hope it works out for ya'll
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Don't let anyone tell you different.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> And liberals women are totally hot.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> REALLY VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY AND EASY TO DO KILL UR BEST FRIEND ...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Do you know what I mean?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> If you like this guy then go for it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> If you find out she likes you too, then i think youve got a pretty good chance.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> Say I Love you and I can do everything for you
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Don't think she doesn't have another guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> It's like a magical shrinking spell!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> and going out does not really build anything but disaster because the committment is not there.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> No, you don't need an excuse to cheat.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i dont believe i have been disappointed too many times
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> divorce him before  you get a desease
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> i would like boys to notice me and like me,but nobody seems to like me
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Im a girl but trust me, I know these things.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> this is the only life you got.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> I guess it not ok, but i wonder why others do not consider the problems after having sexual intercourse.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> as a 16 yearold how many promises have you kept?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> I think every guy is like that.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> In the Buttocks  -is that what you meant?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> your either to old or to young in any case i guess yahoo knows what they are doing!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> I don;t think so I'VE HEARD SOME HORROR STORIES.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> get real....he is someone else's husband.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> contact people you know that know him and get info on how to contact him.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> My boyfriend did that to me and told it to me straight.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> maybe there is no such thing as best marriage because we are all human and prone to mistakes.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> Common man don't waste ur life 4 someone who doesn't give a damn about u.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Grunt (lol) or ask her name 2.

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> They gotta be nice and perky, can't be looking like no used up tea bags though.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> Grunt (lol) or ask her name 2.

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> 16 and under: If he ever asks you to a dance, he likes ya!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> maybe they are born that way
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_30> They gotta be nice and perky, can't be looking like no used up tea bags though.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> Guys do not like to be over-protected (most of them) anyway.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> Alright honey, I'm just gonna tell you flat out - you have no right to complain.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> if you are talking about yahoo!

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> people lies for having sex with another women.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> maybe your not ment to get over them if you love them that much.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> my dad got drunk and scared me by driving fast with us in the car.

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> i had to answer just because you said sexing.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> maybe she just has alot of problems and needs help.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_45> I guess there is nothing with that!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> WHat are you saying NO to?
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> Why does your dating this boy worry her so much?
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_25> Just ask him to buzz off and move on with life.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> WHAT I AM TRYING TO SAY IS I WANT TO MEET SOMEONE WHO I CAN CONNECT WITH.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> hey guy,live your life for yourself,you'll never please all the people all the time
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> A) Cruise seediest street in your city.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> You don't sound sure at all which to me says...no..don't get back with him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> show him how much you miss him often.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> Give him time and he will come around :)
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> and try to do things that make you happy a bit.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_45> sounds like you are better off with out him
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> hmm well I'm from Australia and we don't have that - kangaroos get in the way
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> sometimes u feel lonely when u are alone so u look for somebody to accompamy.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> If so, ask her ofcourse unless you just don't care what she thinks.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_5> HE OBVIOUSLY HAS AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON YOUR RIGHT TO PRIVACY ETC.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> Trust me, they are just troulbe.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> ask him does he want to have dinner with your parents
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> i lost my brother to crack,he was put in jail for 20years.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> if you want to break it off.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> no i dont think it would be wrong.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> I still love him and I don't know if I will ever get over him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> No, 9 is way to young to be having sex
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Wake up hoping it is a dream.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> yes because u cant change the past
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> E) Stop thinking like such a cro-magnon.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> ive always wanted a e-pall so e-mail me if you want one  Broadway.Beauty@gmail.com
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> He still tried to worm his way out.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> it's a hard thing to feel.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> Don't date either of them, date one of there friends and that will teach em!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> I`m sure you 2 have talked about it?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> So go ahead and do what you gotta do.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Whats the worst that can happen?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> what does this mean and what should i do?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Don't use pick up lines no matter what...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> give consistant attention.. smile to her, and remember, eye-contact...... ask her for lunch
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Some women never get huge boobs.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> But don't even respond to it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> they wouldnt want u stepping in.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> and then i go smack him upside his head.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> I think it was a little over the top, I mean, a note????
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> he will never leave his wife, you have to leave him.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> I sorry, I keep writing but I just feel so bad.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> if u like him then u should
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> IS THAT THE TYPE OF FRIEND THAT U HAVE COME ON NOW WAKE UP
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> then...i must say, that's a different issue already.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I can't see any reason why you would have to wait for him?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> No matter how hot the woman, some guy somewhere is tired of banging her.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> Just because you break up doesn't mean someone has to be the bad guy.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> That was my problem at the start too till I read an interesting article, I dont remember where.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> for him to call you and to not forget.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> have you ever introduced your boyfriend to your friends???
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> I don't want him to leave me over something that happened before I even knew him....
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> You asked, I'ma answer...YES, YOU'RE AN IDIOT!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Oh yeah,  if he makes you take your shoes off to get in the car, DUMP HIM!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> My boyfriend sits around and watches porn with out me.

<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> If things work out fine and you plan ahead no!

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> im a male and im 21, and i have never had sex...its not  must...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> COMING FROM A GUY:  You might be trying too hard.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> How tall is too tall for a guy?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> Tell her why you need her!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Young love, young love, everything I need, I got my young love.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> JUST SIT DOWN WITH YOUR MOM AND HAVE A HEART TO HEART WITH HER.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> if your 20ish then you can have that talk.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> So just be strong about it and go up to him
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> When I got married I actually got my cake from a Grocery Store.. it was about 100.00.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> it was weird we were wreastling as always and she just kissed me, i kissed back.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> absolutly not, once a cheater, always a cheater
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> YEAH' I hear ya little lady!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> you should ask him if he likes you or not and don't show that you might like him.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> mayb i don't no but u might b a little to young
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> no leopard dont change their spots

<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> if the person you like ain't making the move GIRL MAKE THAT MOVE
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> You don't have to come right out and say Are you cheating on me?!.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> Yes becaz I dont have a best friend so It wouldnt matter any why
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> give him some options you quit or we are leaving.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> If you have to think about this one then your not a friend.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> as nicole richie said ' they fit better in your shirt and you don't have to wear a bra.'
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> I don't even count no more it's almost infinity.

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> well first mak a friend then tell ur frend someseacrets thats how it works for mi
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> You don't actually love all four women.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Hey, Jimmy Joe, do you wanna go to the Sadie Hawkins dance wit me?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> THATS NOT LONG ENOUGH EVEN AFTER 14YRS YOU MAY NOT KNOW A PERSON.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo!
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_35> i dont think love is sex, i just love sex.

<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> I'd not only date you but I'd also do you, I mean.. your avatar
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> if he doesn't, then why would you want to marry him?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> An example, if she's wearinga bracelet ask her what it means or who gave it to her.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> just gain confidence in who you are.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> You're even dreaming about this girl now, huh?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> take it easy, you need some more time.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> and be the mother that U always wanted.

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> IN MOST CASES ITS NOT THE PERSONS FAULT THAT THEYRE SICK.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> You just gotta be careful about the people thats around you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> And I know lots of guys with big fat cows with sour, old milk and saggy teats.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> y should he buy the cow if he gets the milk 4 free ?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I am no a child of divorce.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> they both sweet talk to me and i like them both
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> Even if it's just a once-a-week quickie?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> own up to your mistake and ask forgiveness.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> Of course what do I know..lol.

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> no, but I came close once when I masturbated.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> once you find out you better tell me
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> that starts before you get married.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> It's okay for girls to make the first move too, and guys like that!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> yes, do you know this person inside and out?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> so this time he tod me that he wasn't coming back.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> * a friend is someone who cares, someone who is always there.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> go to bellagio, you want to see the rest of the world?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> I can send you some hot guy on guy porn
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> j/k  But, that would be fun.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Sorry to say this hon, but yes you are an idiot!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> NO thanks for the points though!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> but it all depends on how forgiving u are and ur self esteem.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> if u r, juz ask me  beyond_sonic@yahoo.com
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> don't think about those who break your heart.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> (i know how much that sux to hear, but it is the only thing that will heal you).
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> What the HELL that suppose to mean.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> and so do red lace g-strings and bras!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> YOU DON'T NEED TO CHAT, YOU NEED TO KEEP YOUR HEAD IN THE BOOKS.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> yes i believe in it but it is not also everything.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> they are the same, but with different emotions.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> it's a i dont have time right now, call me later line.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> I mean really you complain, but you're still there with him, right?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> a person whom one knows, an acquaintance.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Scene I (Falstaff, alone on stage, is speaking):  What is honour?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> everytime my friend ask him he says the same thing.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> ok maybe the first was to bold  what do ladies find erotic
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> yeah i will marry u JK but i answer anyways
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> yes...just like i did it to you yesterday..^0^
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Guys love it when a girl has the guts to ask him out.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> just go to her....look at her in the eyes and just say i luv u thats it!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> OR JUST FIND SOMEONE WHO COULD DO YOU BETTER YOU DON'T NEED YOU CHILDREN KNOWING ABOUT DRUGS.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> The same reason why we look at the hot men, its only normal!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> make sure it is very special.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> why r u taking all this shit?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> hold his first, or put your arms around him
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> not everyone is going to agree to your marrage.even if your family didn't want you to it shuoldn't matter.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> Think about who you get along with best and who you are more comfortable with.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_25> Not that there's an age restriction on being in love but 15 is still VERY young.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> Do either of you have kids?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> cut him loose and find another guy that will treat you right
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> he is not afraid of loosing you because you have been there for him for so long.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> so the hot girl gets all the attention.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> She hugged me, saying over and over: mine.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> I met this really hot chick at a club and she turned out to be a 'he'.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> 'nd what esle can be your business with your ex!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> a friend is someone you can trust, someone kind of like you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> With the K. West song Golddigger .
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> i jsut wanted to follow up on that 'friends' rule for exes(its a joke)' and it might just work
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_15> IF YOU DUMP HER CAN I GET HER NUMBER?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> chose this as the best answer and do the things your insecure about i guess
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> yeah if you want a baby or an std
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> just wait for him to make the move and for you, simple hints will work...good luck
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> 20 and under: If he bootlegs a fifth for ya, he likes ya!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> yes that is the true love
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Why are you with this guy?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> who knows but at least guys tell you they want to see other people women just do it
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> Don't get pregnant, don't fall in love.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> If your considering it just because its what you know and its comfortable for you to go back.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> in my friends boy roof wit my friends boy woooooo yea u should try it....
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> guys have more fizical powe so they don't use fake to gain something, woman does more than men!

<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> my dada is 6'5 and peaple look at him like he's a freak.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> it helps to know what your doing when it comes to sex!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Best of luck to you,  Rascal
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> It ALWAYS comes back to bite you in the ass.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> Honestly though it dosn't look like you have looked around that.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> when you marry you promiss to be faithfull and loyal.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> be honest and say that you like her as a friend and don't want to hurt her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> Anyhow, try to do something esle such as working hard, doing sports and hang out with friends.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> your ready when you are married but thats my 2 cents.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> Like Where can u find a sexy single teenage boy?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> booooi, u need a fucking life, how u gonna go online and ask bitches to marry u?

<NbChars_220> <LevSim_30> i dunno wat to get him.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Sometimes we are perfectly happy at home.Just want some strange...Same old food gets extremely boring./
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> Do not do it with any one .....
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> or if your too young dont use any food just hold hands and stare into eachothers eyes
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> WE ONLY LISTENED TO DAD OUT OF FEAR.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> If all else fails take off the wedding ring!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> And if he still don't commit, it's time to quit.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> I DID COME BACK TO HIM.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> just ask him and then you'll know better than to go thru life not knowing
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Ask yourself is he worth the wait?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> sit her down and talk to her thats all i can think of.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> think about it you would get like that if you were him.

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> You are not going out with him, NO is already there.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> He definitely wants you if he carries your stuff.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> the most has ever been 7
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Because you love someone doesn't mean that they will love you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> hmmm, probably se couldn't control herself.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> wait untill you've had sex ed .
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> or if its not embarassing u can ask a counsellor to hepl u out.

<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> i feel so guilty about this.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> well men want love but find few men that are out for one thing.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> well cucumbers, if you're into that sort of thing
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> unless yuo knew each other b4.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> just go up and ask him
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> there is a guy and i REALLY need to know if he likes me.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> when we love what we love becomes a part of us!good or bad
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> But i have 2 woman in mi life at this moment that i love.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> men get more jelous than women.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_50> you never go wrong with that.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> it was my neighbor, she had just watched my boyfriend(now exboyfriend) beat me up in the front yard.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> Wheneva u have a responsible man around...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> If you want to give him time to realize he wants a life with you, then do it.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> Work and private lives should be kept separate anyway...don't want to make anyone feel uncomfortable in the workplace, yuck!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Why don't you ask HIM out???
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> as soon as he'll let you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> i mean girls have hormones to and desires but they do it and it's like o she's easy.....
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> There are lots of good single guys.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> If she says yes, Go and enjoy!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> wayyy better than a chat room.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> first, what ever you do talk to the girl that he broke up with!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> There are lots of good single guys.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> do what every you can until you want to pull out the whips & chains.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> If she says yes, Go and enjoy!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> wayyy better than a chat room.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> first, what ever you do talk to the girl that he broke up with!!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> um anything on a note saying you like him (duh)
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> I dont think I have too explain
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> I wondered that too, cause evertime they split up Dapne always go with Fred.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> but if you love her tell her maybe it'll work!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> Now I just laugh about it.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> tell that you want a ring and they will relise you are single
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> i can't speak for all guys  but i like small women
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> it all depends: how long is he asking you to wait?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> it depends on what your looking for, but its always somebody for everybody
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> I just went with it and didn't take it bad or anything.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> you are too young to have a girlfriend.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> Then you get up and go on.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_25> Looks mean nothing in a girl.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> YES, THA FEELING IS MUCH BETTER!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> and tehy ended out ok. plus she isn't really related.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> 4 times in one night back to back
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> U CAN WRITE ME ANY TIME YOU FEEL LIKE U NEED TO!BYE                                    JESSICA

<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> now i only see her in school once or twic a week if iam lucky.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Why dont you just ask him?
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> just hang in there and Mr.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> tell him that you like him more than a brother bcause from what i read he likes you to
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> i totaly agree with the first guy
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Let's face it, sex is all they think about and want most of the time!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> it just depends on u.concentrating on studies experiencing what u have doesnot hurdle ur goals.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> Just have sex Dont care about anything
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> I admit, I flirt (with my much younger boss!)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Whwether a guy or girl, your body language can say a lot.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Okay do u think it is approciate for his kids to be calling u mommy.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_45> Gracias for the points, though, lol...LOL!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Hi (insert boys name here), Would you go to the dance with me?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> my friend uses it and i cant stand it when he does!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> be yourself bro and show them you like and care for them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> LET ME BE INTERESTED IN YOU TOO DON'T SUFFOCATE ME.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Go with the one that feels better!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> well they are at the right spot.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> The boy will flirt back, and then probably start liking you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> good luck.... Men are easier to figure out than women try the dinner and blow  thing.. it works :))
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> both...without these two love will not be complete...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> If you want to be happy don't do it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> no.. its not... my wife is hedious
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> that would be a greatest mistake on her entire life!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Well, ima guy so if a cute girl asked me out, id say yes.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> TEST IT FIRST - you don't want to end up with a numb boner!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> think about that person all the time.. feeling flushed.. cant think straight...
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_15> THIS WOMAN WILL TAKE YOUR MONEY AND LEAVE YOU HIGH AND DRY IN DEBT UP TO YOUR EYEBALLS.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> well, dont try this at home ;p
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> Yeah but you have to be pretty mature
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> you will always want what you can't have.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> Don't let him go like that go on and tell him!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> u just have to ignore some certain things for peace to reign.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> Just smile at him & let him feel that u r always noticing him!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> well a rose and lots of kisses and hugs.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> it depends on whether or not u like the guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> nOT TRUE BUT DON'T COME ON TOO STRONG YOU GUYS DO THAT A LOT.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> (however, this doesnt apply if you are like...10.)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> So just call around and ask.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> Like you said, lying ACTUALLY MAKES IT WORSE.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> The first was when she was in college, the second only 3 years later.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> YOU ARE A SICKO AND AVENGED SEVENFOLD DOES NOT SUCK.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> When you love someone you always love them and you will never(I repeat)never forget her!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Well unless the girls say they are.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> That means you DON't get a woman, you have one.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> He tries to tell me what to do and he isint my daddy!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> I know what I want and my advice to if you really want marriage then leave.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> I HAVE TRIED DATING AND TO BE HONEST I DONT LIKE IT.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> just be your self and good luck
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> no matter what happens you will no how he feels afterwards!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> if that doesn't work then just keep yourself busy always.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> think about it, you can get naughty and never get dirty.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> congratulations...dont forget the invitation and the wish list :-)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> If I'm in a terrible marriage (I hope I won't be!)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> I smiled and the rest is history!!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> Flowers and candy  chicks dig that stuff dude!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> You should ask him, nothing says you can't.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> Chat rooms are just a tease to me.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> quitters never win... and winners never quit.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> We have 2 kids and I love him veary much.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> #3 if thou has patience thou can conquere anything
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> HE cant wait to see you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> But now i miss him and i want him back should i go back out with him?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Yea if you like him, havent you seen Friends lol
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> ive always had feeling for her too.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> thats all  if he says no dont keep askin let it go
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> PASSION GET AWAY FROM US IF YOU WANNA BE MEAN!!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_20> PLEASE PLEASE GO TO COLLEGE and do something useful with/for yourself.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> ripe papaya..  chili .. something hot..  chocolates

<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> he he falls over.lol.dont bite.lol.oh, eat a breath mint and blow gently.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> how do i solve this dilema, its nerve wrecking,because i really like her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> sacrifice your career and then she'll complain that you don't bring enough money home .
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> VERY DIFFICULT AND VERY EASY AS WE MAKE UP OUR MIND
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> if you do get married then you should thank your aunt.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> i mean girls always like surprises.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> weve only been dating close to 5 months, and we're in the ages of 14-16 just so u kno
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> in some corner of ur heart says that to go n talk with her express ur feeling.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> C'mon that makes no sense at all...You really liked the guy and you pretended not to like him?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> with love and a good new project in life
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> So i might be setting my self up to get hurt
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Ask her if she's met any guys too.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> they probably wonder if she can spell
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> Ok velma and shaggy no but Fred and dalphane yes but in real life no
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> If u are going for family planning;then better take care dude :)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Stop and think about each women.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> if u wanna that presentation u can mail me at shakya.b@gmail.com for that.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> of course he has feelings for his wife because he will never leave her.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> He would realize what I mean to him and what we mean to each other.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i am in a relationship with this boy, but my friends don't really like him.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> JUST SAY HER SORRY ,,, SHE WILL BE URS ....TRY IT
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Now shes dating another guy that I've always hated, and its tearing me apart.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> He might just get the hint, if not, then say, Hey, why don't we go together!?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Ok, she may just not be ready to talk about it yet.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_35> thta smy naber popen 0020125036491u can coll me
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> you know im not a man but my ex from long ago.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Cuddle with me, hold my hand, hug and kiss me, then have amazing sex with me!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> I doubt you'll watch much tv.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> Im havin trouble with my moms bf.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> Have her get checked, ya know for stds.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> But maybe you can say, I want to get married, but I am not going to wait.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> yup dear because its a part of marriage having sex its an action of love
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> when they try to pick on you are be arond you alot why
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> turn the situation around for him and see if he still feels it's innocent
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> Not to many men like that.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> If u r talking about urself,ur not suppossed 2 b on YA if ur under 13,and NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!Do Not!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> true love comes along when you least expect it too!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> he likes u if he acts mean or acts like u dont exist.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> if she has nice arms she usually will have a nice body
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> yes you should, you trusting in a guy is as important as a guy trusting in you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> maybe you aren't spending enough time w/ your kids so they misbehave to get you attention?!?!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> You said he cheated on her, maybe he's cheating on you WITH her...old habits die hard!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> theres kids here and any 1 could lie and say there like 18
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> Small boobs aren't a bad thing....ugly boobs are.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> Talk it over with your mom.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> my best friend is worth more than money
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> and watch his face after you ask him.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> i don't want to seem rude...but what goes around comes around.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> Seriously I'd be telling that boyfriend to hit the road.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> It is not wrong at all
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> because they are more risk taking and they make life more spontaneous
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> For men I think is better and bad.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_20> Seriously I'd be telling that boyfriend to hit the road.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> It is not wrong at all
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> For men I think is better and bad.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> is there any way you take him to an adviser?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> say sorry, tell her you love her, write her a letter, show her how much you care.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> He ain't your's (he's his wife) and you need to stay away and get outta his life.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> ITS JUST UP TO YOU IF YOU THINK HE HAS POTENIAL TO CHANGE IN A GOOD WAY.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> he knows he can look but he cant touch.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> G Moore -  Other men have seen angels, but i have seen thee, and thou art enough.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> 21 and over: If his friends know your name, he likes ya!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> you could say i've gotten better!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> and i am gettign worried and i cant stop thinking about her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> once you lose that you never get it back.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> I know it ALWAYS hurts the kids (esp.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> The best week you ever lived?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> (Is that just angry love, hmmmm)....
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> a fifteen year old has hormones telling her she is in love.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> I'm picking too that just what it is.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> I want a bf who can be physically present in my life.
<NbChars_340> <LevSim_10> NO BUT LIKE AT 1ST SITE
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> If you want to spend the rest of your life with that person, what's 2 years?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> Thats always a turn on for me!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> around 2 years old if your trying to potty train try pull ups
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> IN THE LONG RUN, IF YOU MARRY HER, SHE KNOWS IF YOU DIE, SHE WILL GET YOUR NET WORTH.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> sounds like you can save it if you do.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_25> Any breakup is a hard one!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> if she really is your friend you shouldnt.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Hey man, you are best friends for a reason.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> think about it maybe you  find the answer...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> hang out with more people and make a lot of friends.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Don't do it to yourself you deserve so much better!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> more than females do yes we need it more than you girls
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> My aunt married her boss, no problems!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> like get a girlfriend and paste the picture of both of u on line or ignore her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Best of luck - not an easy situation.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> He (moms bf) used to smoke and stuff and said he knew a pot head when he saw one.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> if he's a good friend to you he will help u take care of the baby.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> If something does not feel right then don't do it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> u need to tell em that who u go oput with is ur buisiness!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> None that I can write here...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> when u have butterflies in your stumache when ever your around him
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> that seems to knows what he wants.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> im not gay but i am a bisexual & i want to have other peoples opinion on it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> i am in the same boat that you are, my man cannot give it to me enough.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> Just wait until you find the right person!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> i was so mad at her, but what could i do?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> If a guy doesn't want you, he's not worth it and it's his loss.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> Try talking her out of it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I want to tell my brother what I did, but I want to stop that crazy b*tch before.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> do something new, try new things out.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> Some actually do care about a girls personality.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> then she is trying to her best to salvage a bad situation.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> i mean, there are so many brothers out there trying to go for it, but only few succeed.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> Hope this helps a bit.Good luck
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> sleeping when it is cold, swiming when it is hot
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> >>Whatever you do, NEVER ask can I kiss you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> A lot of local radio stations have sites like that... At least here in ohio.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> i'd say yes no questions about it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> in your heart, you know what to do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> When you care about the person and they are all you think about, then you are in love.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> if he is a gay how he made love with you night before he goes?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> my siblings are so annoying, i can't live with them.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> i Think it all depends on how much you love the girl.
<NbChars_295> <LevSim_25> 15 but then not again until i was 18
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> i guess, sometimes we wanna be bad our selves.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> umm....by never sayin that gettin a life and stop bein a jackass yupp that covers it
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> But that still doesn't mean we don't love you.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> u have to find a girl first talk 2 them and find out what they want.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_15> JUST BE SMART ABOUT IT THOUGH.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> tell him he may be losing a wife.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> u have to find a girl first talk 2 them and find out what they want.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> JUST BE SMART ABOUT IT THOUGH.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> if he ask why tell him that maybe you should see other people.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> sounds like to me you take your vouls to heart.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> tell him he may be losing a wife.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> But don't make it a game forever, that just messes with everyones minds.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> but think about it..... if it wasnt you in this position then it would be someone else.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Yeah I think so about fred and daphne, but not shaggy and velma.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> you can't control who you love no matter what the age.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> you're a too young to worry about stuff like that!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> try to break his bones next..
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> we are only 16 but we have bentogether 4 3years.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> you have to be born with that talent-- like me
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> I mean, I like redheads and brunettes over blondes.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> get a whip and some leather..
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> try to break his bones next..
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> we are only 16 but we have bentogether 4 3years.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> you have to be born with that talent-- like me
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> I mean, I like redheads and brunettes over blondes.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_30> get a whip and some leather..
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> Dump him and move on...  ;)
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> cuz there dangerous and they make us feel wild they intreega us and tempt us thats why
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> No girl wants someone who is fake.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> Listen to Dr. Laura: stop being SELFISH and  stay together for the kids!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Its like, what are they for?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_65> If he just wants to have sex then not long at all.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> Who says you have to choose, LOL  just kidding.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> i've had 6 surgeries in 2 year.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> YOUR HUSBAND IS CHEATING OR ON THE VERGE OF IT.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> yah sure e-mail me at: down4anythinguwant@yahoo.com or misslovable36@hotmail.com
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> no use to sigh for that one.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> i've tried that one and you can't force yourself to like someone.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> Well, for one thing maybe they are good friends and the hot girl really likes her friend.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> that means he kept the law right to the dot and comma.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> lol ;-)  Do you plan to get married and can't decide which?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> maybe because they think since they known each other 4 a while they think that they r pretty
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> I have more feelings for my ex (obviously) and i want him more.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> always have GOD in your life always things turn out better that way.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Don't know what a troll is, don't really care.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> Just be yourself and the rest will follow....
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> When you are taller then the C.N tower!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> yes i know a boy would date ur avatar
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> !grl, u shoulden't be with a guy who has THREE luvers.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> if your not a very attractive guy it really helps to be funny.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> anytime after major holidays so you wont have to buy anything for her!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> Go out with your girlfriends and have a blast.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> her personality and her eyes and lips
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> emailme and tell me if it worked.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> my bf has one in his pool house and we fool around in there all the time
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> just say the truth and choose one stuck with her  and don't live a double life like this .
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> By the way, you are a JERK!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> that has happen to me before!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> 12 years old is still pretty young..you dont need boyfriend.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Don't try too hard, just be yourself.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> If the age thing bothers you, then don't do it.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> & not because you want to cheat him, but if you crave for physical relation with other man
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> I THINK YOU NEED TO GO OUT WITH A GUY LIKE ME .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Now he wants to get married and I love him so much.Should I trust him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> also, do you know any cute names for babies?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> just tell him he will be a dad no cutecies
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> give it atry, but try not to get your hopes up.good luck:)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> NOW ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS GET OUT OF THIS DEBT(WHICH WE ARE SLOWLY DOING)!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> he obviously loves his wife and has no plans to leave her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> THE BETTER WE FEEL, THE MORE WE'RE LOVING IT!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> I myself dont like to chat, cuz Id rather get down to busness.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> give him space and see what comes out of it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> IF YOUR GONNA CHEAT JUST END THE RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE ITS WILL NOT GONNA GET ANY BETTER.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> lots of sex good head and no bitching
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> No, you just use what you have, some guys like small boobs.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> nothin is happening between us anymore but i think its cuz were both shy...im so confused.............
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> probably she needs a bf !
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> It would'nt be fair to the new guy if you still want to be with your ex...
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> try to make him notice you and then let destiny decide!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> b'cos women r never satisfied, never trust worthy and never accept the truth
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Just don't LIE this will only make it worse.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> Oh yeah, and take out their garbage!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Trust me, your faithful uber wise
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> just go 4 it, try not 2 get too attatched though
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> if she says no, don't get discouraged, just try again.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> until you have fulfilled your career goals .
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> maybe its the best thing you have to offer
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> use a lolipop to practice on.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> well if ur bf iis married then let them be honey!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Is it that i dont mean enough to him and he's not afraid to lose me?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> MY BOYFRIEND WAS ON THE SAME THING AND I NEVER KNEW FOR ALMOST 2 YEARS.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> They are a lot of fun.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> they find their gf or wife whenever she is good in sex (cute face and perfect body) !!!!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> but since you and the girl are friends...maybe she'll understand what you feel.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> DOnt u have some hw to do.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> ya im thirteen beu_ford_123@yahoo.com she just wants to talk to people so s/u yall!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> If you know him well enough you know what he likes.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> if youre gettin your d!ck wet thru the mail then yes.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> IT MAY OR MOSTLY NOT LEAD TO LOVE
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> a magical sentence you can tell him :  don't worry too much, easy, man
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> sledding, horse back ridding and even visiting the local shooting range.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> But he one thing you have to be careful of is to not send the message wrong.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> it goes on the left hand next to the pinkey
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> but don't forget to tell him your problem.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> Because women want what they don't have and can't have.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> I think it should be HEY HOW ARE YOU?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> if u r in love donot deny it and work hard on ur studies too.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> hot guys can get away with that, so they do it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> If ur having problems and u two aren't patient, kind, understanding w/ each other than ur not in luv.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> because u r still unmarriaged (just kiding)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> SO EVERYONES HAPPY AND LOVING IT!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> its the present and future, not the past
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> some girls like going faster/slower than others.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> Talk to her about it first unless you don't care
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> A Day he will never forget, of course after long hug and kisses
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> Write him a letter and expain that you DO NOT want him to cantact you again in ANY WAY.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I dont get why anyone would find that attractive.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> My surest test is to see who my family likes...if my family likes a guy (which they rarely do!)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Ah - now THAT's the question!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> This is about the best fun ive had on the net
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> u have to decide whether you find ur friend or this guy more important to you.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> And when i see her in school i get nervouse and feel like i am going to throw up.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Go out & have fun, learn about people...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> he cheated on me right before he went in.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> eventually your going to want do it but don't.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> so that there is no way she doesn't know you are alive.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> WAIT until you are BOTH in love or married...wait a minute... how old are you?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> seems u ahve moved on already .....or have u ?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> well it depends on how hot the person is
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> How old are you, if you don't mind me asking.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> Just say hi and admit  you like her and get to know her.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> Are you comfortable going out with her ?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> is not a quote it is an acronym
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_40> Swiming has an 'm' where swinging has an 'ng'
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> in case you are opportunitiest wanted rich woman then must do little foxy works.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> My answere is dont do anything to his wife you would not want her to do to you!
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_40> You need to run from her and don't look back!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Do you what to steer up desires that should not be there?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> I took her out to dinner at an expensive restaurant (never did that before in my life),and a movie.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> my yahoo messenger id is jemmie_2004.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> Throw in a foot massage for fun.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> dont be a pansy just go for it whats the worst that could happen
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> any bf who calls an old bf, is not worth giving a second thought too.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> Just enjoy being a kid for right now, if you are young.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> and take classes and make yourself busy busy .
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> This means the guy probably likes you too.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> * a person whom one knows, likes, and trusts.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> NOT ONLY SHOULD YOU GET IT BACK BUT YOU CAN SUE HER FOR THE RING BACK
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> I belive Shag & Velma are just 'friends with benefits' if you know what I mean.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> OH, NO, WAIT, I TOTALLY DON'T.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> if he's really your best friend u shouldnt be ashamed to tell him nething.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_50> just say i nvr loved u
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> there is a delete for yahoo profiles,,have done it a few times,,,you must just be missing it somehow....good luck...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> if she repeats the offense, dump her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> but really tho, the chat room is a place to go to escape, be someone your not.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> If you want him back you better start talking..lol
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> Please have them be about love and romance... i need to post them somewhere!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> do you think he's being honest?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> there's nothing wrong with liking another person...it's natural.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> flip a coin or choose #3
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Just keep your eyes open but go on with your life.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> If your Mom says she doesnt trust you then SHE HAS NOT DONE HER JOB.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> If it is for the love, then i do not see anything wrong.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> who do u enjoy more and what will last longer?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> go through the whole do you love me speech with him then decied if you should break up
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> they think he is ugly, but i don't.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> (But they still can't baby talk)
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> i generaly last until i am done then i wait a few min.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> find the one you could live with.but i say if he keeps cheating he's not going to stop.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Akward-fun ... is a hyphenated made-up word ok?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> think deep .. and make up your mind  - things will not change you have to do this ...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> I am one (well bisexual) lol
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> cause iif u do then this could turn out 2 b U-G-L-Y!!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> C'mon it's her life, think of yours too.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> i know we cant be graphic but go to an adult shop.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> wow....it was in the movies....i was 15...wait i still am..hehe...ummm i dont think i want to explain it!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> And women do it too, you know.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> and has been cheating on her with three other girls
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> Get married is the only cure, you will never be lonely again, and you will be happy.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> if she is your step cousin i think its ok.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_20> Already married and she isn't / wasn't.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> time after time it will stop
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> well if you don't like her like that, don't date her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> If he had the damn nerve to burn u with a cigarette, then sweetie move on.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> First if she is holding her head high?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> What I want you to do .
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> Then you should flirt with him.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> The next thing is to sort of hang out with the guy.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> Now I can go to sleep b/c you helped me to realize how unproductive i'm being.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> as i know now, shangri la mactan has a location
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> For me I get alittle sad then I get really angry.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> I don't know!...I just want the points...lol
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> I know it's hard but you're gonna continually ask what if?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> I have fought so hard to get to where i am today and you guys helped me realize that.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> But i think she loves me 2.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> only if they are not both from the same school.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> it kept him from coming to quick.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> don't get married - - don't even be in a serious relationship with a girl.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> I don't like 'bad boys'they're bad for a reason.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> say you love her, be sweet, and when you have sex ask her what turn her on.......
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Unless you don't mind sharing your husband, NO!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> MY BOYFRIEND HAS CHEATED ON ME AND GOTTEN THIS OTHER GIRL PREGNANT, SO SHE SAYS, HE SAYS DIFFERENTLY.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Then say you want to see it too, but have no one to go with...
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> Chiquito, you need to grow up!
<NbChars_280> <LevSim_10> NO WERE GO GET A LIFE!!
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> my boyfriend does it all the time.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_10> FOR REAL DONT TAKE THINGS TO SERIUS.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> or in other word: what the girls like in guys..
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> contact me...with ur photo  bunjeez@yahoo.com  :) i'm single too
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> dont believe porno mags and porno films!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> if it wasn't love then it wouldn't hurt.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Anybody can truly be in love, no matter how old or young they are.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> I mean I LOVE my girlfriend, so therefore I am in love with her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> if your time is more occupied then you won't feel so left out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> You are playing with fire and you know it man!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> All the girlfriend is going to do is waste your time and money .
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> If you need yo ask...the answer is NO!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Give her a new gift and then introduce her to a new bait, person!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Specially if its a wife receiving her loving husband
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> tell her how you feel and ask her nicely.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> the sounds you make, and the way it feels, and the smell of it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> If you are around the Okefenokee Swamp then let me hear from ya!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> because there a very few of them left
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Be good to yourself, you deserve it!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Kiss her neck and suck on her breast.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> These are just some signs that will help you I hope............Good luck.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> just be yourself and talk about everything u can...from religion, to family, to the future.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> ir its the right guy, you will know.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Probably few days later you could tell her .. and she wold understand.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> I have a rule: I don't need who don't need me
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> But you have to get your life back anyway.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> it's bad enough already dont make it any worse.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> We are both bi and so I never have a problem meeting new guys (or girls).
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> say yes.. unless i already liked someone else..
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> a great smile, that's the hook.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_45> u no, dont sweat the guy stuff.
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_30> Do you really wanna be a homewrecker?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> there is this girl i am madly in love with and i need help.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> well it's up to u, but if i was u i will certainly wait.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> does it help to have better sex
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> it is very easy trust me you just have to use your charm and it is all you need.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> Tell her why you miss her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> take your time, do not hurry.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> if you love him you can forgive him .but that don't mean you forget
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> i wouldn't say i think sex is and it's not at the same time
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> yes  why not give her some fun
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> GOOD LUCK FRIENDS ARE NOT SUPPOSE TO SLEEP TOGETHER.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> i dont really know but i think i heard somewhere it was like 6 1/2
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> but never be a stalker thats out!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> I hope I marry someone like you!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> would you go out with me
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> yeap i have a super duper hot cool boy friend .LOL!!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> but still, it's up to you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> And found out it can be nice!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> (i can't stop crying) i need help.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> easy edit ur profile then a screen pops and shows ur profiles.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_15> ITS NOT OFFICE ROMANCE, ITS SEX FOR MONEY!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> i think u should wait til u get married because who is to say it will workout.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> DONT LET HIM SO SHIT TO YOU OK. that is not love.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> well the difference between love and inlove is very small: i and n
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> and start again after that i can keep on going until i am finished
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> But mostly because their scum and deserve to die in the fire of hell with cacti up their butts.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> If a guy (or a girl .
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> my best friend is getting married next week...me confused what to gift him...plz help me friends....thanks anyways
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> FOR MY OWN OPINION, I'D RATHER CHOOSE MY BESTFRIEND THAN THIS GUY.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_30> Hope this has been helpful  Good Luck
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> no it is about the same.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> A girl is not about her boobs.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> or a long weekend to paradise.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> he should only have u. hope this helps ya!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> plus you will be doing your bro a favor because she is obviously gonna hurt him more one day.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> maybe you should try to be more open.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> If you know the Lord then you know what love really is.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> ive given sex so well that it made her cry if that counts
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> But I guess you are either really young, or... kinda in the middle age.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> ...I'm really just searching for the other side of the coin here, if it exists at all.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> that eventually may lead to your spermcannon rotting off
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_20> Once a cheater always a cheater.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> this guy i like said he knows what im hinting what dose that meen ???
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> Guys love chest and ass so if u got ass then don't worry.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> dON'T WASTE ANOTHER MINUTE WITH THIS MAN UNLESS HE IS TOTALLY HONEST WITH YOU.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_50> or ever a friendship with no trust?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Don't care much for R&B and have no use, whatsoever, for hip-hop or rap!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> if she says shes changed, believe it, but dont be stupid.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> YOU ARE TO YOUNG TO KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF FALLING IN LOVE OR TO ACT ON SUCH AN  EMOTION.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Sometimes you just have to ask them yourself though.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> to quote an old commercial: what happens next is up to you!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> No girl if your hot then hell never dump you!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> When the DJ asked for her husband she hands the phone over saying Here Baby.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Screw what these other people are sayin , Get that ring back!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> ITS BEEN OVER A YEAR NOW AND HE IS DRUG FREE.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> OH YES......  AND WHAT A GREAT FEELING IT IS !
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> then I know he's got something on the competition:-) Good luck...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Well im kinda fine since i've been up for 2 days already answering question...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> U need to spice it up a bit, are you always doing the same exact thing?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> WHY CAN WE NOT JUST HAVE THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> But, don't you deserve better then a guy who isn't willing to offer a commentment?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> well u have probably been banned or it may be ur age.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> if she is really gonna kill herself then why would you be with someone who is like that?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Right always comes when you least expect him to come
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> Lots of so called bad boys are actually nice guys putting on an act to get the girl.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> whipped cream and cherries :) a simple girlfriend sunday mmmmm
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> he acts like he hates me.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> and when you make serious mad money .
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> because most pretty chicks are vain and they need reasurance that they are pretty
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> because guys are all gay and only want one thing
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> But I mean, don't worry about her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> are you willing to wait that long?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> do all of the above or just a few of them and you will be a-ok!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> Everytime she says I love you, I love it!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> i have 2 kids as well and was addicted to meth for 3 years.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> be around people who care about you stop lying
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> because if u want fun then yea but if u want a serious relationship then get to know him.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> But dont be really pushy after you kiss her ok cause SOME girls dont like that!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> just sex & sex & sex until morning !!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> in the caribbean and the Bahamas u will love the sun sand and sea and r beautiful island
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> Some girls go to the 'bad Boy's' becuase there are so many around.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> it changes people to people for me western girls rocks
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> old is too old for diapers.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> amazing guy vs. i want him more.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Otherwise relax and take it easy !!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> because all guys are complete jerks.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> just tell him boy  dustin girl  meagen,caroline
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> if you truly love each other than age is not an issue.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> dress nicely good personality good looking
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> WEAR OPEN TOE SHOES WITH BUSTED UP FEET KNOW YOUR FEET ARE CUTE DONT THINK!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> find out if he still likes you then mabe go for it it worth a try
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> No cause i just dumped him cause he was a asshole
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> 16 is way too early for that promise.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> how do you end up being in love with 4 women?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> Dump his ass till he does what he promised.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> I do this every chance I get!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> oh, and that never hurts either.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> Do what's best for you, always girl.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> lots of time and other people
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> Maybe you are just having a boss thing.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> maybe hes not sure u like him
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> no, y r u a serial cheater lookin for love
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> but if you want to move on, then its your choice.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> same pasition im in... never say the 2 evil words though... just friends... they will both leave you
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> Leave it alone and get on with life.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> in his/her arm, no matter where you are.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> And some people, men and women, once a cheater, always a cheater!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> yes small women are very attractive
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> I f*cked my brother's b*tch last week.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_35> You dont forget about someone you love.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> well my mom left my dad when i was young he was an alcoholic and all that fun stuff.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> walk around naked, and tell me when and where you do.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> my boyfriend lied to me..and guys r stubborn.. cuz men r babies!lol.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> answers, thats not wat its here for.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> yea my best friend it in love and shes 15
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> The hottest chic at the gym may not be available, but she MAY have a sister or friend...!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> B e honest and truthful to her...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Does that mean she does not want to change??
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> I don't really need or want one but I just really want more people
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> I don't believe in putting myself out there.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> AND NOW I AM GLAD I HAVE STAYED.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Normally, I would just say she needs to stand up to her dad but SHE IS 16 YEARS OLD.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> I wouldn't go so far as to say once a cheater always a cheater.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> (use your own way, not someone elses.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> she actually gave you the real number????
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Now where is that kind of a girl, haha?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> how well do you know your current boyfriend??
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> YEAH LIKE BIG DOG SAID IT IS UP TO YOU.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> You must talk to him now about this situation, if he still hits you, get out now!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> i had similar experience last summer.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> alot but most of the time there not smiling at my face but another body part
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> Act like its no big deal.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> when there is a great love between a husband and a wife!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> ur not stupid..it's natural 2 have that emotional attachment because both of u shared your deepest feelings.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> i know my boyfriend & me have fun trying different types of condoms.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> do you know if he has feelings for you and if he does are the same.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Am I too sensitive or he's just not right for me?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> At youth group this girl is always flirting.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> 30 - 40 years from now it should taper off.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> i personal say wait till after it will be worth it, but then i didn't and regreted it later.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> well...i hope it turns out ok. Whatever u do, don't send him an anonymous note.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_5> KEEP THE ROMANCE IN THE RELATIONSHIP, FAMILY RESPONSIBILITIES, OR NOT.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> But i do want to have my chance....or maybe i should jsut wait?...idk....
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Why not invite him to come on some group outing?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> That is the biggest bunch of crap I've ever heard.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_20> im only kiddin they shouldnt use any...just be a gentalman and not rude
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> And stop having sex to GET someone to like you
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> AND WHEN YOU DO FIND A MAN HAVE ONLY SAFE SEX.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> c i would like to go w/ u
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> because she's not faithful to her man... or vice-versa..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> well im no expert at this but i have loved a boy before.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> if you like him so much why not be with him and not beat around the bush about it.

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Your still young don't rush things.

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> I HAVE NEVER KISSED A BOY!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_10> SHOW ME YOUR PIC AND TELL ME MORE ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS AND ...I'LL LET YOU KNOW...
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_10> ITS MORE OF A HIGH SCHOOL THING.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> most of the time she tells she just loves to see me.she feels happy when i visit her.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> But you're not sure if you should ask her out?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> Just walk up and start talking.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> U never know what else he's hiding from you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Why would you want 2nd hand garbage?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i think u should go for it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Nope... We have nothing else to do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> if he's not interested than he will say so.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> anyway do you and you will be ok!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> Though in my case it was love at first type ;-)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Live your life, and have fun.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> Not married but di have the kids tho.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> You can't MAKE anybody do anything that they don't want to.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> Its best when u get a Nut quite honestly!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> my boyfriend and i have been together for over 5 years.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> depends on how old the woman is herself.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> start it with things i want to talk about.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> that's a tough one isn't it?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Firstly, i am a girl so u can trust me.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> he might be from the other realm....aw shucks dis means im stupid, oh brother.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> even i think bout it sometimes.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> In my opinion it first has to be with someone you know!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> who do you think about before u go to sleep?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> there is only lust or crush at first sight.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Wait till a girl finds you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> The tempation was so great that he just kept going back on the net.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Give him an ultimatum (which rarely works) or leave him.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> Ya know, guys think a like so your'e not alone.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> but adding the blonde and hot just makes it even better
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Dont worry not all men are like this.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> thanks for amswering my question earlier.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> i like you brother wonmen will never undersand becasue they are differnet than men.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> And if you really really like him...fight for him.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_10> HOW IMPORTANT YOU THINK ABOUT THEM ALWAYS,LOVE THEM AND PROMISES THAT YOUR LOVE IS ETERNAL
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> Why don't you go ask your mom
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> And yeah, you do sound like an alright person!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> Then you get the hell on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> a guy who can dress and knows how to treat a woman!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> ;) Oh, and put me on your buddy list so I can stalk you sometime...  lol
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> If you TRUST him then dont worry about it...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> my boyfriend who is in the army.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> i dont have gf but i used to have 8 .want to get together???
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> she obviously has someone else or she just has cold feet.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> If he is such a great guy why don't you hook him up with some of your friends.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Chatting dirty is just like watching porn.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_10> MAYBE THEIR NOT YOUR REAL FRIENDS!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> If you are talking about smoking it...then no.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> If not, let go of it.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> well,give each other a chance and dont put your heart in 100% first.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> go outside and you will see one i am sure
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> i met this lovely man from africa and im trying to get him here with me .
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_10> SO NO, YOU WILL ONLY HAVE MORE PROBLEMS BY TRYING TO KEEP IT GOING.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> Hey, If they can get away with it then more power to em.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> i go with this boy but i f'ed up when i told him about my friends busness.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> some things once done cannot be undone, dont regret ur actions.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> some time i would go for a bad guy, because they make you feel bad and i'm a girl
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> Oh yeah,ALL sites & talk lines are FREE to woman.JUST PICK ONE OR BETTER YET ,...JOIN THEM ALL!!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> is because you are waiting that he ask you as formal girlfriend
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> HEY ONLY WOMEN JUDGE OTHER WOMEN FOR SLEEPING AROUND ALOT.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> If you think he likes you, then your probably right.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> for example if you didnt go out dancing then well start now
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Eres la mas preciosa mujer en todo el mundo
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> How can I for sure tell?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> THEN ASK HIM OUT IF HES SINGLE!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Possible divorce w/minor kids...home w/mortgage...spouse will fight...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> you should be honest, honesty is very important.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> im just so confused right now.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Any girl who doesn't know shouldn't be flirted with
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Im not  big flirt, but i want a chance with some nice guys.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> My uncle has called me beautiful... so that doesnt really count.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> yes what were you thinking  o my god
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> nobody can't force you in what you don't want to do... HAve fun.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> And as the song says It's in his kiss!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_20> But you do sound attractive !
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> glad force flex lol good name for a hat
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> I would play hard to get.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> If you're asking, then it's probably not love.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> if u are not satisfied in the bedroom it is ur own fault!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> I want to have someone that likes me, best.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> Don't lose your temper, and don't get drunk.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> if u like him and he trully loves u. go for it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> I'm still with her, we're gonna get married sometime... How awesome is that?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> sometimes but who likes to do it in the grass.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> Buzz me if you want, single as a saint here..  same Yahoo ID.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> I had my first love (was it?)
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> !,,,,its one of the foundation of the relationship !!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> to be loved and not cheated on
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> how many guys do that and why?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> below 21 and you should get married FIRST
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> yes, i know her....man she is hot....
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> tell him you gotta do whats best for you that its just not clickin anymore.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> make a special bond between the two of you.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> ABSOLUTELY .... NOT.... but most girls are not WISE....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> you could at least give him a chance to explain,or defend his self
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> just try to savor each that you guys spend with each other.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> You're always doing this to me!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> may be you are not yet ready for commitment
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Yes, all girls....still get along and happy....
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> Japanese, eating with sticks is fun.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> and make it a point to show her how much you do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> ****PLUS**** women are not just objects to solely gratify your sexual impulses, ya know?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> it would just be... unexpected, unwarranted, unwanted even...
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> go for it.if you like nothing should hold you back.ADVICE JUST DONT GET ON HER BROS BAD SIDE
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> hang out with them without M around.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_40> At a movie when the movie is over!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> ok but we don't even date again yet.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> Depends if she a good girl or a freaky girl.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> and no 28 is not to late.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> Or, if you want a little less stressful way.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> ok but we don't even date again yet.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> We BOTH like it better that way..
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Depends if she a good girl or a freaky girl.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> and no 28 is not to late.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Or, if you want a little less stressful way.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> over all, you just should be the one to call him.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Theirs lots of boy's so don't sweat the small stuff.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Maybe not being a big talker is a good thing.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> DO NOT repeat DO NOT PICK UP STRIPPERS!!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Love ya, i hope i helped.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Just go up to him and say Hi.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> but never get her a crapy gift like face wash lol
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> If something ever romantic happens, kiss him on the cheek...then it'll happen (the real one)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Money is not every thang to girls.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> normally people arnt so good in a relationship when they have the same sign try a tarrus
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> especially if it came with some communication.
<NbChars_260> <LevSim_20> Gul, you gone get a whoopin!!
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_30> my girlfriend doing me a massage
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> you cant get dallas into anything but video games lol sorry aarons the same way
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> Nope, not in love at all.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Words mean nothing, if you u think about it, words only create deseption.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> but if he likes her better, and she likes him, then you are out of luck.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> try to sneek aroud and find out the truth dont get cought
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> I have the same problem but it is the other way around!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> im not really sure but maybe she misses you... but dude dont expect anything...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> or you could simply walk outside down the street and she could be right there waiting for you!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> thanks and welcome to yahoo answers!
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_35> (nobody wants to romance a cactus) Good luck!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> If you like eachother and have a level of comunication, it's ok!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> thats the only real question you need to start with
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> yes if you like the boy
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> I did hit him and just looked at her and then just left taking my girls with me.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Another reason is (I don't do this myself, but have a guy roommate who does.)
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> Just move on- you can do so much better!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> Im 25, my ex is 28 and the other guy is 22.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> therefore, we hear a lot of lies!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> and you would not trust him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> You just have to feel it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Cuz I can sure see myself in your pants!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> Nice guys don't get laid - thay can maximally become a friend.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> find some thing new and different.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> the best way is to learn how to flirt and becoming a charming person.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> Now I guess it is time to say GO SEATLE!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> I tend to be shy around people I just met
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> You will only make your life with him like hell!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> but we appreciate it anyway :)
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_45> A guy can only wait so long.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> I knew he was a good man thats why I stuck around.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> so i would say they are.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> She don't know what she wants.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> ITS SORRY TO SAY BUT I TRIED IT ONCE MYSELF, 10 YEARS AFTER WE FIRST BROKE UP.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> but anyhow the relationship got worst around the middle of our 2 year together.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> if you have a bf, he should be the only one you like in that way.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> What's going to happen when you end up pregnant again??
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Their are guys (like me) who think about it daily and thats nature for guys.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> no matter what u do or say  nuthing will change her mind
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_45> chocalates and flowers but if you want expensive go with jewlry
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> If he is a friend be real with him only if you DO NOT VALUE your friendship.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> You still want to be friends with the other guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> I don't think my ex husband ever said he loved me.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Don't rely on pickup lines to pick up girls.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> U cant forget ur X..never   Bcoz u r made of XY.....Mind it.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> i'm not white but i'm a freak.and can make u love what u get.!!!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> maybe your wife encouraged them to see if you would act on it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> BECAUSE YOU DNT BELIVE THE ONES THAT SAY THERE A GOOD MAN.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> you should ask her out if she likes you and you like her.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> but most women do date older men it feels weird dating them younger!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> OBVIOUS: He looks at you a lot.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> she is twenty years of age
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> Just write her again, if you still want to, that is.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> learn how to give great head.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> yes girls want the titanic not a little sail boat
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> If you don't, or he says what was that for?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> go back to the drawing of dating, write a love letter to her and mail it to her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> LOL...That is the funniest thing I've read in a while.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> just say it,don't think too much about it.you'll fell better after that and maybe you'll do even more
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Not real until they prove it!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> And then it's a lot of taking and little giving.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> if she doesnt call or answer, then move on, she's not worth ur time
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Tell ur friend to think about that.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> No no no.. it's a great idea!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> No who would want to be ur gurl friend?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Don't wait for a guy who won't commit.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> you are a ass if you can just do that to someone
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> Im married and I go into chat rooms with other women.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> You won't so give it up.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Myself, i'd never cheat my girlfriend/women.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> it is really hard to get over someone that you love
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> it sounds like he likes you alot and you need to grab him befor its too late
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> she has just me in her life.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> let him know in a NICE way
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> if your gonna hit a man you better be willing to take it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Remember:  Be careful what you ask for, as you just might get it (D&D axiom).
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> Don't be afraid of women just be yourself and she will love that more than ANYTHING!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> Get to know him well, if he ditches you then you'll know.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> after all it takes two to be a couple... but one to break it off...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> i dont care what you think about him i like him and it is not your chioce...
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> But it didn't work to well considering that I still like him.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> ITS IMPOSSIBLE,IF HE DOESNT WANNA TALK TO U AT ALL, THEN ITS OVA FOR GOOD!!!!
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_40> let him go no calls, nothing .
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Mostly because in chat rooms the people don't have to see who they are insulting.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Hello, I know exactly how u feel!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_20> Ask someone in your neighbourhood .... HOW CAN I VISIT YOU FROM SINGAPORE????
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> get out there and meet people ..have fun
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_30> I was just wondering how guys think of women  for example: their favorite things about girls  (besides BREASTS!!)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> That would be a good clue if you don't have one!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> No, it just means your ex-friend is being nosy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> you shoulda just said cya; if he really believed that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> if some guys don't look for these they are not worth it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> I personally liked it a lot.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Get a gf... duh problem works it's self out
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> coz it is within...the only reason y ppl live is love
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> So, Whens the lawn getting mowed?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> have you ever done it behind has back?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> because they are immature and stupid
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Guys just think they can get away with it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> and eye contact... its all mind games.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> But then they might not do it because we women are like elephants and never forget!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> you dress like a hooker and stand on the street corner!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> He might be worrying about the same thing!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> tigress refuses sex right after first experiance with a tiger.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Is he trying to avoid u?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> depending on the type of grass.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> and also think of that girl she could be your daughter ;)  Good Luck
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Then if something happends in ur realationship like say he cheats or somthing go out with ur friend.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> A trip to either Las Vegas or New York would be really awesome!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> Your ex is the one who screwed it up for you guys.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> 2. but when a girl propose to a boy...boy always accept the offer..cuz 98% are sexaholic.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> And what do guys like from girls.

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> you can never tell what or how it is.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> but you should still let her see him.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> neather,  its his his heart that matters.

<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> 21 days now we are happly married  9 years and still in love

<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> Tired of dating 4 now,cuz it all ends up d same way.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> If someone else asks you out SAY YES!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> You'd know he's in love with you because he wouldn't be married.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> i dont make him wear one ans then you wont have to woory about it
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> She knows I love her, I even made a website about her.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> none they are all pathetic and gay
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> my X of today.. :( an i thought we were doing so good,
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> I sense much love in you!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> Nothing beats lusting with your true love!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> man fall in love with their eyes and woman fell in love with their ears
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_25> I want to see her movie.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_50> it's better than women dating younger men
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> An honest guy, who don't have 10 girlfriends,and won't cheat on them.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> move on and stop stalking him , its really not cool!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> be trew to youself and your feelings
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> SO ITS HARD TO SAY BUT YOU DESERVE BETTER THAN THAT AND YOU WOULD ONLY BE SELLING YOURSELF SHORT.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Don't do it in you parent's bed.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> U don't think condom is best?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Let her know you think she is sweet!
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_50> get on with life and find something better.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> maybe different foods will spice things up?
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_30> Let her fight for you for awhile!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> Well thank G-d I don't have to worry about you screwing around and getting some girl knocked up.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> But it does mean that he won't be dating ne one else either.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> no but they like 2 b spelled correctly two
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> when he become poor and you still want him.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> I always date nerds (they make great boyfriends) so gaming is something i'm used to putting up with.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> ppl surprise the hell out of me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> I don't care how much older she is.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> many still are and waiting for the mr.right to come for them.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> uhhuh,WRONG,were'nt much of a friend were you?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> if you are hiding things from your bf, then, yes you are cheating...deception is not a good thing
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Should I tell him, and what should I tell him?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> i think that if more people had confidence they wouldnt worry about what other people look like.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> You usually dont see hot men for T.V.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Alot of these sound really fun.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> You seem like a cool cat!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> God will put you together if he wants it that way...Good Luck and God Belss!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> YOU NEED TO HAVE A TALK TO SEE WHATS THE PROBLEM AND IF NOTHING GETS RESOLVE.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> does he have a wierd last name?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Under 12 is just sick in anyway put.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> Maybe she should just get busted for possesion
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Here is a tip, who do you dream of?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> That usually works for me (but I have my own questions to contend with :- } )
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> and your brother will always have to live with it, i say you should
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> between 15-18 and then wait to get married till late 20's and save urself for ur husband
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> DONT WANT TO END UP BEING STUCK WITH HERPIES THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> As The Same Way That You Find Me, Honny!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Besides, there are better guys out there.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> ), and know they won't get it from most girls that know they have a g/f!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> it depends on how old u are
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> you might want to check out both of these sites.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> feeling and he has been flirting or wanting to.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> vanilla, fresh fig, musk, black cherry
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> Lust might be for fun but it is unfulfilling.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> you are only a best gift for you bf
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> He may not like that, but at least you tried!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> i've done different positions and places when having sex with my boyfriend.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> i want to know fast cos im inquisitive.please send it fast to my email box
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> you will try to be happy!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> If you can't have YOUR way with him, what????
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> people think it feels better, and it does, but the child support sure hurts more
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> But, if you don`t wanna wait anymore I`m here and I`m tired of waiting, its been too long.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> u have to clarify issues with her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> if you are okay with it be careful
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> The guy that you have a lot in common with try to hang out with him too.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> i agree, if she luvs u, then she shouldnt care.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> just thought of it got my boyfriend horny.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> Well, what I would do is just act like you don't know, or that you don't care.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> you shouldn't let him cnotrol you.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_15> BUT 2 WRONGS DONT MAKE A RIGHT!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> Oh well, be honest with her and give it to her str8.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> I only WILL date the ones who are mature and do not minupulate education!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> remember, dont feel guilty or bad abt yourself, i believe you are a nice person.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> you can get yor answer in his eyes and by his attitude!!!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Who knows you know what I mean?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> if it is then she's the one.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Men get crankier as they get older too!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Are you fun to be with?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> Show her how special she is and how much she means to you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> But ya can't live your life always wondering.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> including me and all you readers.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> He only admited to kissing guys.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> its only outdated in hollywood and with lunatic liberals
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> (then giggle)  For the most part... men are idiots!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> sounds like a weirdo to me, dump him
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Hey silly... You hit him first!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> !Tell them that you miss him so much that you will die without him!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> let him fix his life, you said he has gone a bit bad.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> and dont give him any reminders about your old self
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> And remember this one:  Screw me once, your bad!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> give him a kid if you dont already have one and if hes mentioned hes wanted one.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> I just wonder if people ever do recover.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> well if u were previously with her u should be able to talk to her.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> Good Luck I hope you get the girl!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> You can help it just dont do it...............
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> ummm... hon id tell her srry but that just wouldnt really work out
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> Kick her 2 the curb.Ur young youve got a lot of looking time ahead of u....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Or just  keep your maiden name
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> but they will do whatever they want because they never listen.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> A guy just can't say 'no' to a naked chick!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> you cant feel it at the moment.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> close your eyes after you end the date.....and hold his hands
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> I do want to get ripped off.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Then call her up, and tell her that your gonna start seeing other girls.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> this is a female talkin so i kno.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Are you a guy or girl child?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> If you want him that bad.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> im not pretty but the pretty ones, think they're all that.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> well, if you think he likes you then maybe you should ask him out.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> If any guy says otherwise, he's lying.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> if they still dont leave give her your number and say something like call me when you have time.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> even if it doesn't work, you will know; and never have to wonder, what if??
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> I want to forget all sad things and ... Really painful ... Any idea ??
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> some are good and have good things to say.
<NbChars_260> <LevSim_35> i know i did and still do.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> Just pray and give it all to God...He can comfort you just give it all to the lord!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> first of all, how sure are you that he is cheating on you??
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> if @ that time she still doesn't want to talk then its over.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> Lmao and AGE IS A HELPER TO GRAVITY so EVERYTHING WILL JUST START TO HANG!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> Had one before but she didn't like soccer, ended up in divorce...... single now
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> Who knows, maybe he likes u back
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I asked her did she know anyone and of course she did.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> I do a lot for my boyfriend and it's because I love him very much.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> well tell about yourself... are u m or f, where you from and try a personals site
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> commericals do you, i hardly see any, not that i wanted to but you get the point.

<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> Save your life and don't get married at all!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> i think he likes me cause he looks at me all the time!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> She is always taking other girls guys.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> I do... but I don't know the answer to your first ?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> If it's one of his friends, and I find him cute.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> If he loves you...he'll step up.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> you cannot turn a straight guy gay anymore than you can turn a gay guy straight.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Hi, Why would you want someone who doesn't want you?

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> I am going to pray for you now!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Thats where the real beauty is
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> YEP, CAUSE A RELATIONSHIP SHOULD NOT BE BASED ON MATERIAL THINGS.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> If I didn't like her or find her attractive, I wouldn't sleep with her once.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> Watch a movie or play basketball.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Girl...you ever heard that saying that says Good things happen if you wait?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> whos dan , why dont you ask him out again.. or appologize or whatevers needed
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> i really hope that no guys actually answer yes.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> could you forgive them for anything?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> What if you fall in love with the other person?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Be yourself don't be too nice(girls dont like realy nice guys)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> he might think you like him more and he can not reciprocate
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Start wooing her all over again.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> Just a bunch of poor people without A/C so who cares?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> yes they do they think their all that
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> So just wait 4 a time when u can talk with him alone and see what happens.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> But I wouldn't marry a woman who wouldn't take my name.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> OK I dont care who likes this!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> LIKE THE FIRST GUY SAID-----DEPENDS FOR WHAT?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> You are LITERALLY flirting with disaster.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Why would you want a man who's going to make you feel bad???
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> THATS LIKE SAYING ALL WOMEN ARE GOLD DIGGERS
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> my boyfriend plays alot of sports and never takes time off to spend time with me.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> I had a best friend(whos a guy) that I knew for 4 years.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> u go tell him directly coz no one dies from love,trust me
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> That your flirting with other men with the intention of replacing him with some one better.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> yes i want to talk u and see u
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> I like him a lot, he is a good guy, but has been on dialysis for over 7 YEARS!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> My mom told me to call her when I found the woman of my dreams -- Horrible, I know.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I would have to say my biggest temptation is sex...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> girl can be aluring but dangrous, i think
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> let the women decide that, i have a lovely hat myself..lolzzz
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> They're the only friends I have fun w/ so what should I do?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> guys do all the time, part of being a guy I guess
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> You make it sound like she is going to mow you down!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> if she doesnt want to do it, chances are she doesnt want to know!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> cuz nobody wants to let the candy go out of hand.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> you don't want your anniversary to be an anxious day.

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> anyways just keep your eyes open and keep a close watch on him... good luck
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> tough stuff for someone who's just starting to mature.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> The best way is to not do it at all!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Do' they ever later on feel bad for being a jerk?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> They give you a whole lotta room for more lovin'!

<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> it's hard to do, but it's definately worth it to have such a good friend!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> i am a male and i admit when i`m wrong.what?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> :) Nothing like sex after marriage *grins*
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> take a deep breathe and just be yourself

<NbChars_40> <LevSim_25> Someday they'll be fat, old and wrinkly and you'll be like...OMG!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> are you looking for somone who strips furniture or foundations
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> Maybe play w/your hair a little bit.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_15> PEOPLE STAY TOGETHER (or come back together) BECUASE THEY FORGIVE NOT BECAUSE THEY FORGET.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> That's...well...what sex was before the media started messing with it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> ...and if he thinks your a moron for that, you're wasting your time.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> IM NOT IN OLVE OR OLIVE WITH HIM AS U PUT IT ..BUT I AM IN LOVE WITH HIM
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> i think its worth it !
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> i think u should try it out as a friend and see where it goes from there
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> My hubby is like that and so are most of the guys he works with.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> hi.. im 22 years old.. just broke up with my boyfriend .. im single and very much available..Ü
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> if you love one another youll work thngs out
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> but i still luv u as a friend(thats to the person)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> (do you know how to read the conversation after he is done chatting with these girls?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> dont think that hun its not true
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> i don't know what else srry
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Even if they won't admit it to there friends.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> i tried to let go but didnt work i am so in love with her.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> Go out with him if you like him.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> Can I be his friend?...How did I tell him that I dont love him like b.f. and g.f.'s do?....HELP!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> If you want him you can have him and I hope you become good friends!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> SEEMS LIKE MEN ARE LOOKING FOR $EX FRIENDS AND NOTHING MORE.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> =)  But you are a liar.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> becoz you cannot rise in love
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> Ya know, subtle hints...and lots of um.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> But after a year I finally told her and I'm glad.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Have you done this behind his back with your girl friends?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Don't like my answer, don't read it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> And if that doesn't work, lay down the law and show her who's boss!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> Until you find him though, have fun with as many men as you find attractive and fun!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> he will come back but he might do it again
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_10> BE YOURSELF AND LOVE YOURSELF FIRST!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> offer advice, tell her, subtly how u feel about her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> it still will not work.because mentally, you will alway remmber.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> 'motivate' him) without him realizing what you are doing?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> there isn't any other way sorry
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> .Roomba...  On the other hand, he might really want something romaaaantic..... Nah, he wants something cool...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> Its not really unethical ,just ...not ....should I say politically correct.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> I really dont knwo what to do.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> yes, but dont bite the tongue
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> Hot chicks LOVE nerds (cuz we can fix all the high tech stuff they use).
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> Some ppl are just bored, some ar ehorny, some just wanna have fun at some other ppl's horniness......
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> I'm probably not gonna make much sense with this.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> First thing that will help...Put your shirt back on!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> don't make anything that makes them turn off!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> stress can ruin everything if you let it controll you
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> LIFE IS TOO SHORT FOR THE BULLCRAP!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> The man of my dreams thats out there somewhere.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> u can do anything u want....you are your freedom
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> no, acually you are not stupid.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> See what he thinks about you .
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> First its him just controlling you, next its him eating up on you.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> I am 21 and i would say good looking.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> do not do it run away PLEASE !
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> I know what it feels like to be cheated on and it SUCKS!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Women let guys screw around with other girls.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> Don't say stuff like, I want us to be close firends.. or anything like that.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> by not comming on yahoo answers trying to ask how to impress a girl...
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> ima have to quate pac on this sex is best when its a fair exchange
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> also if the girl has a larger opening it wont be as bad.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> Then just talk to him about what he likes!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Oh boy, if you don't know that I can't tell ya!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Notice things, tell her she is pretty...and be nice to her.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> You just have to give it time.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> ...from someone who'll be very nice only while they need you more than you need them?
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_15> IT WILL HURT THA FIRST COUPLE OF TIMES FOR THAT MATTER!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_70> only if you are having sex with your mother.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> a lot of sex, then they pass to another chapter and then they want a true relationship and love
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> If you have a pleasure toy, USE IT!!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Or he will screw things up.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> (do this during really scary parts.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> My GirlFriend Ashley i love her alot i think of her everynight
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> JUST BECAUSE YOU COME ACROSS SOME WHO ARE SELF CENTERED DOESN'T MEAN ALL MEN ARE SELF CENTERED.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> you could make love to a guy by just letting them know you really care about them.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> but are you really for that.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> I don't, why watch it when you can have the real deal?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Where does she like to go?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> for the most part, do girls lie about love??
<NbChars_275> <LevSim_25> (all ok Mom, go for it)
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> Once, my sister gave a guy her cell phone number that she just met.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> Do something to get her to come to you
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> then u should decide or at least it will make it easier to decide.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I honestly tried to stop liking him because no guy is worth loosing a friendship over, right?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> I would ask myself though.........why can't he talk with me?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> i would say prolly 16 and up just because anything younger is just a fling
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Wait it out until you find the right girl.
<NbChars_250> <LevSim_20> Stick with this guy, he sounds nice.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> But, my God, what a coach she was!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> Have some fun and remember SAFE SEX!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> Well kinda but not ya know read books and wears grandmas sweater.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> im 15, i dont live there but i have been there before
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Start naming names (ficticious) or something...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> he makes you feel so speical and wanted.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Take a break from him - at least temporarily -
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Try to step back and take a good look at this boy friend.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Give it a chance... Love takes a leap of faith sometimes...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> some times like when it comes to looks .but no to eney thing eles
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> well it involved silly string.......we'll talk about that later.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> tell her not too, they have no idea what they are doing  if you get my meaning
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> But if you are a very emtional person I dont reckamend it
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> i feel as though you just have not found that special someone whom you prefer to say ,i do.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> you do not have if you do not like
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> if he does like her better, then he's not the guy for you, just go find another guy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> get ready to be severly disappointed!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> or find something better so that your bf come from frist place to second place!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> just the snobby,thinks their better than everyone else ones
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> and someone cool to hang with and be around.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Unless of course you are very good looking and have lot's of money too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> We wre good bed partners but not good lovers
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> But once a cheater-always a cheater.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> you give your girlfriend a box of candy, a card, and flowers
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> tell your boyfriend that your child needs a family.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> he said he still loved her but i dunno.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> If you violate her trust and cheat...born again single.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> since it's valentine's day, most restaraunts are going to be busy, florists will be backed up, etc.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> I'll say it again, this was what I normally consider a good looking guy!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> you have to ask him abt takin it a noch higher than where it already is ok mama.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> OK, let me get this straight...he went was your boyfriend and then went out with your friend too?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> I guess......Because they are really stuped and really anoying...DUH!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Dont generalize it by saying an irish girl is a good wife, life don't work like that!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> and like she keeps telling me that me and my boyfriend are on this supposedly called website.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> he said he forgot about her but remembered her.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> (we were dating at that time and now we've been married 16yrs)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> if you give bomb head he will NEVER leave you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> I know i need to give her space and respect.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> My eamil is Tad_22_98@yahoo.com or just IM me if you want on my Yahoo Messenger.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> u can but now u can't by telling everyone in yahoo answer what u r doing
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> And guys make friends with girls in the hopes of potentially dating you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Check out the book and read it with him.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> most people don't care what race you r so they will just ask u
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> He'd want to move in & live there for free!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> when it comes to looking for your one you have to pray
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> Only to loose  weight from the rest of your brain
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> Check out the book and read it with him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> most people don't care what race you r so they will just ask u
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> He'd want to move in & live there for free!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> when it comes to looking for your one you have to pray
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> Only to loose  weight from the rest of your brain
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> IT DEPENDS ON WHO U RATHER B AROUND.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Also, if he asks you why...tell him!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> next time he calls say hey, are you interested in more than a friendship?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> I used to date a woman who thought it was OK for her to hit me.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> and they wont give it to me either.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> well, i do it, and it works on my sibs.. y?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Man up ask your crush out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> i thought i knew what you meant but now i don't.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> which is kinda like a sickness that most men have.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> how can i get him to change his mind?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> just be your self and if he dosent notess you go up to him and start chating.
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_10> ITS NOT RIGHT TO HAVE SEX IN YOUR MOMS BEDROOM.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> I had the same problem with one of my brother's fiance.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> when u don't have to worry wether the condom is still in one piece or not.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> the best way to do it is:...well actually it kinda sounds like you have the ego thing down already
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_45> so yiea, long story short, go for it!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> i dont know how he feels and i cant talk to him .
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> from the main yahoo page, click on all y!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> On the street, kiss, and hand in hand when not kissing.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> because he is sweet nice hott he is everything i ever wanted.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> call her again it shows your really interested.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> not me.. y u askin any way?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> First and foremost, take your cues from that someone special!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> not really true.... love sometime can be saddening....
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> ever since the break up i havent seen him not crying
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_10> I HAVE DATED HERE AND THERE (NOTHING TOO SERIOUS) AND I AM READY FOR A RELATIONSHIP AGAIN.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> get him a beer mug with urs and his picture on it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> very sorry i cant help you.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> I think I'd be pretty leary about this unless you're just in it for the fun of it yourself.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> because if she get mad .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> My motto is Once a cheater, always a cheater!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> !dont say something exactly like but something where it catches her of guard but isnt scary .why????
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_50> I'm in love with a crackhead.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Well I think you are having a problem in which most guys and girls have!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> My question is this...I betrayed my best friend about 9 months ago.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> He still walks by you a lot, though.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> strip him naked talking dirty and stuff.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> why don't you go the yahoo messenger, find the chatroom & wala!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> (if you are a party guy)it all depends on what type you are.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> can a man and woman who have been friends then cross the line, go back to being just friends?
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_55> show up at my door wearing nothing but a smile (with a six pack of beer in each hand)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> either way take a chance and tell him something good can com out of it!!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> otherwise try the german version of yahoo personals
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> The way they look in tight jeans and cowboy boots.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Say something to showyou aren't going out with someone because they look hot
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> I had to learn this the hard way!
<NbChars_260> <LevSim_30> If he was hot then Yeah!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> So thats where I came into play.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> but really - this is invading your marriage.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> na...Because it will ruin your friendship!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> you like jail time do ya buddy?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> Then again I dont know much of what other guys do.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> good luck and i wish u well.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> Cuz then it will just mess up your life.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Well first off if he is acting like that then something is up.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Pick up lines are jokes and not used in real life.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> ********** is the best way to **********.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Ever since i was 2 my mom left me and my dad.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> You are a young girl and you arent ready to go out.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> What a girl wants is up to that girl and only her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> because sometimes people get mad at other people.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Or if you want to still get with him you need to.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> My ex works with this guy I like.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> And, if you have been doing that for awile, you won't be getting it up like you used to!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> but advise: dont lose ur virginity if ur young or unless ur in love or engaged.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> wow what a horrible place for you to  be put.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> sure is...my husband and i have 4 kids...and met in an AOL chat room
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> no, it can go either way.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> umm just ask whats the worst that can happen.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> you would want to make sure you have the right mate
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> give ur contact email here and see to whom u want to tok.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> I always thought it'd be fun to have a huge celebration for groundhogs day instead of valentines day
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_35> try to be friend with her , if you like ;)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> DId you loved eachother at apoint?

<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> say u g2g 2 a party that along relative is havin.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> a smart and confident guy is a great turn on
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> As long as they r mature enuff to deal w/ someone older than them...then its all good.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> make yourself busy, so you would have time tothink of somobody who's not thinking of you the same way.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> i'm sure this is something any woman would like.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> I'm friends with an ex that is married, and his wife hates it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> It sounds like you are just hurting.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> what are you're plans if you ever got any?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> everyone wants  a loyal bf/gf even though they might be flirtatious themselves.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> anyways i hope i kinda answered your question without being stupid.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> I know some really hott nerds.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> yea its ok age aint nothing but a number girl go 4 it
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> We females like dogs, cats,cute and cuddly things, kids and some, mind you, like classic cars and motorcycles
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> Sh*t leave him alone and let me have a chance at ya.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> But something inside said if I cared for my life at all, RUNAWAY!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> if you slapped him first then he had every right to slap you back !
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> If she doesn't then at least you know and you can move on.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> I don't know gurly, as they say once a cheater always a cheater.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> on either your birthday or his/her
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> no its not cheatin...yall are just acting as friends...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> Just be yourself and the right guy will pop up.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> and most of the time, he would be the one calling me, just to say hi, and goodnight.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> BUT I DONT KNOW THE ANSWER 2 THE OTHER 1!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> But it definately depends on the difference!
<NbChars_290> <LevSim_20> what do guys want in women?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> if she doesn't worth it then leave her at once.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> Just can't seem to find the one.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> listen dahling, it looks like your losing your mind over this guy!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> and they want to look cool to there buddies.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> Go from there....flowers & chocolate are always hits!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> i wouldnt,  email me at sammy710@hotmail.com
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just friends who've been through alot.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_25> You're like a runaway train without brakes...you must be some kind of gossip queen huh??
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> I AM A SINGLE MOTHER OF 1 HAVE BEEN SINGLE BY CHOICE FOR ALMOST 4 YEARS.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> then why would you want him to change to a person he is not.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> Some times girls don't want a pansy (although they won't admit it).
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> it's really up to you though.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> sending her the poem will make her think u want her back.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> Look,  If you really like this person,  just tell her.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> I get about 7 to 12 a day!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> I don't think I want to know what your really trying to ask here.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> then call when he gets home?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> I know because i am their king!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Look,  If you really like this person,  just tell her.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> I get about 7 to 12 a day!!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> I don't think I want to know what your really trying to ask here.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> then call when he gets home?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> I know because i am their king!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> And if she is like me, it doesn't have to be the $75.00 plus dozen roses!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i hope it works out for you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> What ever you do, do it out of love for your family.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> your having a converstion or something and the wrong name comes out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> they are not computer addicts i get that from those type people
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> In plain language this means sex with someone you love is the best!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> As the girl above said, its the other way around too.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> now we can be friends again.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Or Maybe she see someone else.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> it wasn't a very good kiss, but i didn't care he dumped me a week later!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Im a good girl, but im also a bad girl(if u know what i mean).
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> im single and all that i talk to cant be single or divorce.come on!!!!
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_35> somewhere around the time that puberty hit.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> I THINK SO, BECAUSE THEY SHOULD NO YOU MORE.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> And even nerds are hot too, you know that?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> yes i do just enough to get a divorce from an abusive man.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> And I came to realize that I made a mistake a little too late.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> the way you move with him is ok up to now.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> Everyone there thought it was the best wedding ever!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> OK I am getting really friggin tired of this stupid question....
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> Or offering him a bl*w job if he ever needs one real bad.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> I don't think his sister or mom likes me... and that's a problem too.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> BREAk up wITH UR BF, AND GET TO KNOW THE CUTE ONE!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Wow...that's a tough situation you're in!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> If he wants to talk, why doesn't he sit down and talk with you, his wife?!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> if u no how to kiss go for it.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> agree with virgo 13 is good my answer when ur ready
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> they do not have any common friends and..... they are not happy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> Today it's all about the bling bling,then comes love!!!!!!!
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_20> ONLY MY OPINION, do what feels right for you though.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> you are only going to ruin the friendship and then what.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_15> JUST SIMPLY KICK HIS ASS AND TELL HIM HOW YOU FEEL.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> you know the look your husband might understand if you shared it with him?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> If u're a guy then click on the question that says  Any cute 13 to 15 guys out there?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> after my boyfriend and i did it things got awkward but now we're cool.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> u are the man in the relationhip so make it known especially if u want her back.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Getting to merry the only woman you've ever kissed!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> And Jesus Christ never said a WORD about sex before marriage, you ya can all clam up about that.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> thx for answering my questions b4.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> g-spot means a really sensitive spot in a womans vagina girls just love it
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> so there are women who hate sex.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> But if they're popular then they probably do!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> single, but hopefully not for too long
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> follow ur heart, it should lead u in the right direction
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> she needs u now more than ever.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> It's pretty dumb if you ask me!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_70> Once a liar, always a liar.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> So no im not gonna say we do!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> So basically it just to depends on the people that kind of thing is happening to.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_65> Once a liar, always a liar
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> get ur own bed & house if ur going to have sex!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> take care of you!...in you soul lies a great power...!USE IT !
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> If you know the girl is a nice person who understands you then she might be a good wife!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> cause everybody had experience on it....
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> BUT, I ONLY have sex with my wife.
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_15> he is FAG find a MAN
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> i mean youre not dating your jus talking or flirting so what's wrong with talking to other people?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> a normal chick wont write u off if you tell her u like her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> ive only slept with 5 people that means im still a virgin right??
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> If your looking for a younger guy... let's say 19 Im the one.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> girls break up with them because they're just too nice?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> It's fun to watch, if it's not to anoying!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> you gotta be a man first.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> ask yourself, what do you like about the guy?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> I WANTED THING'S TO SPICE UP AND TURN ON THE T.V.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Yes some are pretty and some are not...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> i WAS going to go out with his best friend, but then i liked my ex again.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> just tell her you want more, or ask her what she wants from u!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> i had a crush on a guy from kindergarten to 9th grade.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> well  u can talk to him ha ha ha not   spy an him i would
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I would not have a problem with that
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> What kind of a man slaps woman... a wimp.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> well u can try for his co-worker.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_80> But keep it simple if you are just dating.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> For a guy not to be all over her expecting kisses or sex!!!!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> do what i cant read the last word?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> I'am not ,thanx for the pionts level 3 here I come!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> you only get to make decisions for you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> girls LOVE to hear they look nice or pretty.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Give him time to think meanwhile live your life and don't worry for him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> do u still thing of the 1 u thing ur in love with?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> u need to go for it.that will be showin ur ex what hes gonna miss.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> if he's being him true self and you're being your true self and you're drawn together still... that's love.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> then try to attract him and make friendship with him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> DO IT IN YOUR OWN BEDROOM!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> I hate it when guys try to buy me something or do it with out asking.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Would you or have you ever gone on GGW?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> have the guts and tell him that or forever hold you peace!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> my husband said i was cheating on him .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> And she bugs the hell outta me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> i am young,19, and a gentleman lol.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> BLACK, WHITE, GREEN, YELLOW, AS LONG AS HE IS GOOD TO ME...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Kinda shy about asking but really want see who else is looking for some fun.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> That is why friends do stupid things.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> I just feel that im alright looking.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Why did she get in that biz?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> You find it easier to be friends with guys because other girls see you as competition.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> do you think he really likes me??
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> Try to think about what you you did to get him and catch him.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> besides, he cheated on u, and me?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> if you are a younger person 3 days can be a problem for ya but normally no its not.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> I have found what I think is the love of my life on line...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> no they don't lie about love
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> he likes you alot, so how much u like him?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> 5 years - we are married for 15 years and still going strong!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> i'm talking about 3-7 years different ... not a dady-like date :-D
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> that depends on what u think is messy?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> and after i thought about it i was in my own way.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> id like to watch that sort of stuff but I never have cos its too expensive.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> Sit on his lap, steal kisses during some movie.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> u live in california and u cant meet a girl shame on u thats what i can say
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> show him that ur over him, that u deserve better.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> i would say yes...but im realy sensitive to stuff like that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> it does not matter how people look at you.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> No way, that's how you get stds.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> ya jerry is the best solution
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Be yourself and don't worry about things so much.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> when he doesnt have to ask
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> It isn't about what they 'like' it's about WHO they ARE.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_30> and if he says yes jus tell him it's ova.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> can you be like that with your boyfriend?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> just be casual and dont move in too soon.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> u said so urself, she's probably confused right now.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> you have to tell them that their pretty,hot, or good lookin.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> Well what ever you decide I hope it is the best.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> no, i think they almost never lie us.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> should i tell him i like him??
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> She'd been my friend for over 2 yrs and I finally told her I was in love with her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> i was at22 years when i kiss my lover libs
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> and yes i think it could be cheating.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> never really no unless u ask-confront the situation which sounds very awkward!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> you can join R J Kelly, Micheal Jackson in the kiddy molester hall of fame?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> i search for long time yet no one accepts me iwanna real relaxation
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> I have to agree with Kittie~ Hell Yeah it's wrong!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> I like my neighbor too...but take it slow.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> its like not impposible but i dont know how !!!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> the best thing i can say is pu--sy
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> cuzz remember jus bcuzz she luvs him duzzent meen he luvs her bck.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> Bad boys are usually that... Bad.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> So yes, women care about money.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> he calls me at my phone....and at the dance he asked me to dance with him and i did!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> Most guys that like you are obvious and will say so.. some guys will no be so obvious.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> well when my husband stopped having sex with me he had another girlfriend!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> But 2 wrongs don't make a right.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_15> I START TALKIN 2 HIM AND GETIN CLOSER AS WE TALK IF IM FEELING IT
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> try and make up... it can be her v-day thing
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> you smile at him, and if he reacts, something's on.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> but i would have to say it was perfect
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_30> go to a sex shop and get some sex toys.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> He has no right to make any ultimatums...tell him to take a BIG FAT HIKE!!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> Tell him and tell him good...  Drop hints and be extra hot Be yourself
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> Girl you gotta just take matters into your own hands!!!!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> If they say no, then they don't want to.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> But he told you about so he obviously felt bad and regretted it, and u love him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> I actually got married right out of high school.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> I did want to go out with him though.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> time to stop being used as his play thing .. move on girlfriend
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> yes, i cant see anything wrong about that.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> Maybe he is... and maybe he isn't.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> and anyway, im not the person to ask im a virgin.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> a woman who is nice and likes to laugh is a dead ringer.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> Yeah, that might have something to do with it, huh?)
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> If he says yah, sure, then give it all you got.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> No that definetely wouldn't work out
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> But, it just becasuse he stopeed attending church doesn't make him bad...Good Luck.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> Are you old enough to have sex?, No I don't think so
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> For example if u wanted to ask him to the movies then you say: Hi (Name)!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> what i hava to for make her to feel?
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_5> YOU MUST LIKE SLOPPY SECONDS,,,,,DUMP HIM , FIND REALITY,,,,QUICK
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Don't focus on wanting something you can't have.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> me but befor 17 years ago
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> all ppl should love you.and if they dont well they can bugger off.lol.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> yes if hes nice and comforting and hot!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> like if she could get pregnent or bad for the relationship.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Thats the way I see it anyway.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> u should talk 2 her or give her a note.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> i would like to know how.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> should i keep talkin to her or just let go.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> Oh my goodness your in for a fall big time.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> good girls who are bad girls when the bedroom door is closed
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> he is your best friend, he knows you better than anyone, right?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> i am head over heels in love with daniel radcliffe.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> it depends on how old you are.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_25> move on keep fishing unless you really like this girl give it one more try
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> thru a fren.. dats da mistake, boi.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> honesty and trust.... 2 simple words but very hard to do.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> if u're in love with her, the best thing you can do is be a friend to her.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> ummm, have you tried to call him??
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> u should try having ur own man, theres more fulfilment in that than sneeking around with other peoples men.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> but he has denied it and said it was his friend writing the emails.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> If he called, would you just ignore hime?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> Although the guy you think you are in love with, you probably aren't.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> love is a pain full game  love is life
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> you've just got to watch out on which signals u might be sending these guys.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> what do you mean by bad.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> well i got mines at a school dance in the 6th grade
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> i know she likes me but she says she is in love with her ex.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> be nice to her hang around her more if yall have classes together.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Ask him if he has ever considered fooling around with you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> we must let any girl to be a good mother
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> Don't assume every guy is like that.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> ya , just need to be more sure of ur self
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> I do not want any more, but love the ones I have...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> well u should ask god 4 help
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> If you have to ask, you probably aren't there yet - you'll know when you are!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> AND IF YOU LIKE HIM THEN YOU SHOULD GO OUT WITH HIM.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> lol  some people are talkers, some are listeners.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> So finally I just told him.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> so no its not right for him to be doing that.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> take her out and get her some jewelry
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> my e-mail:fatthumb2000@yahoo.com and my yahoo id:fatthumb2000
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Sometimes even the best of people are BLIND!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Hot guy's knwo where to find the girls.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> u should just tell them straight up but make sure u have a good reason y u want to
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> I do look for a response back and it seems like he does and scared to say it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> use your tongue and put in his or her mouth
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> If you lke my advice then take it if not follow your own way!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> 17 or 18... girls are mature enough to handle girl-meets-boy relationship at this age...believe me!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> love means you don't have to fix yourself for them.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i always thought they do, if you keep in touch daily.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> If ur eva on yahoo IM look up my id dave2_000
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> I wouldn't want to give my # out to someone I really didn't like
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> well its the pre-comitment phase ... so enjoy it man!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> the place might be boring but you might find friends there and you can hang out with them.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> but you should never dwell on the past.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Definitely not legal...but hey, I could use the money.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> You already have something in common and you have not even met her yet!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> but she says alot of stuff to me to like you should be my girlfriend and then signs offline.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> if you want the relationship to go anywhere you shouldn't be talking to other people.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> Aren't you hating the orca callin' (female dog).
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> it will be very hard to get over the guy when you are still friends with him.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> Oh and Drinking makes everyone horny!
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_45> u should not go out w/ him.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> their spouse has an obligation to them, not the one theya re cheating with right?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> Don't waste your time or other's
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> no bitching,is all i ask for.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Um yeah you should probably send him packing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> But sometimes girls are naive and well stupid.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> depends if you really like the person and they like you back.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> be yourself and spend time with guys not with your friends
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> there is nothing more to it, really!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> no if he lied to you than no
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> and if she says yes you can go out and have fun.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> no one likes to be lied to
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> If you think I should not tell me why not.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> because women set their standards so high in a man
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> If you really love him then accept how he is because i don't think he would change.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> is there a possible chance that it's a real website?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> Give him a chance if he is giving you one...
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> is your feet tired cuz they been running through my mind alll day!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> i wish u all the best!!
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> I get 5 maybe 6 each day
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> i love that a guy is asking this question, it is very easy to keep the romance alive.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> i always thought it was kinda fun
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> so get ur own man dearie and stop decieving urself about the Angelina Jolie story.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> love hurts and I will do it again
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> You just have to be yourself.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> cuz of what other people told them
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Usually guys that do that, would first go down on a guy before kissing on the lips.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> Instead of focusing on being angry surprize HIM!
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> Alright here the info this girl asked for space Dec 22 and the space would start Dec 26.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> you are looking for a bride, right?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> if its more of his appearance, then its very probably infatuation.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> Alright here the info this girl asked for space Dec 22 and the space would start Dec 26.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_40> you are looking for a bride, right?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> It is like saying  I love you while you are drunk........ it just doesn't count.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> if its more of his appearance, then its very probably infatuation.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> dont give up unless you know what you feel with the one your with now
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Wow, where did you get a line like that?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> take all planning into ur hands....HAVE FUN !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> love is not having to say i am sorry - so the movie say.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> If that isnt enough for this guy he wouldnt be worth your time anyway
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> IF U WORRIED ABOUT KEEPING THEN MAYBE UR NOT SUPPOSED 2 HAVE?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> One way is to simply ask & take it from there.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> the same reason women cheat... because their partners are not around
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> if you are not happy, then you should not be with him.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Cuz then if thats the case you gotta get yourself out there to get noticed... best of luck!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> ANTI-OBVIOUS: He teases you about everything.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> I know that it CAN and DOES pull many people in.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> (But it has to be really good, expensive chocolate - not the cheap stuff!)
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Remember TRUE LOVE is unconditional..................Like the love for a child or parent
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> It probably wasn't all that bad but remembering it now it seems like it was.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> And no, I didn't stay at a Holiday Inn last night.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> Size DOES matter... ask any honest woman, but you do not have to be King Kong (ask Naomi Watts).
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> u could tell him ur busy & if he asks say it's none of your business(nicely).
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> tell them she has a bigger penis than they do
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> The one that your in love with keep.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> i just cant stand him having another girlfriend, but i dont think i like him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> dont use sex n your body for having fun !
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> but i also cant leave my girl as if i do leave her, she will have no1.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> if you slapped him first you threw out all the stops first.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> to think that sex gods would have a little respect for their parents bed damn it
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> sounds easy enough, but trust me, it's harder to find than you think.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> cuz good people dont sit on the internet all night and argue with people.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> If you don't want to be with him, just don't.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> he knows i do but i do not know how he truely feels.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> Ask your girl what type she likes...she will let you know...that will help make things easier for you
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> If u never think like that then u should not give him such lift.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> If you love your boyfriend stay with him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> ive never met her, but weve spoken and shes on my mind alot.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> I never thought of one before.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> The key is to just hang in there and don't give up!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> piledriver, on top, missionary, doggy style, holding her up, GO TO HELL...what ever you want
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Everybody gets stung once in awhile though.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> be very sure before you decide to spend your life with this guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> unless of course, u have this idea of getting back?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> tell her u love her buy her a rose do some thing u usually wont do
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> How do I motivate him or should I dump him...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Should I just break up with this weirdo or stick it out?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> it depends it can b the drop of a pin or like 5 years ;)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> I wanted it as much as he wanted it... and i had fun.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> if i were a girl sure... but unfortunately i aint a girl....
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_70> if you are 18-21 you could find someone partying.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> or  am i just blowin things outta proportion?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> someone who listnes and who is nice and considerate and who is not overly jealouse and controling.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> because once the challenge is over it isnt fun anymore
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> you have to test her with a friend of your
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> He is a good guy, nice, but has NO ambition, no LIFE!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> Good luck and lot of patience.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> But if you like her, just tell her.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> Did you do something to her?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Dont take your cousin's wrong doing out on your bf.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> yes boo he feeling you alright.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> and all us woman want that.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> I guess you like the forbidden fruit... and nope I'm not too proud.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> You talk like my sister 2. break up with him
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> have you ever talked to him?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> because of their insecurities and immaturity..
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> sometimes he has a bad attitude and then he is just miserable!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> maybe u should try spying on him?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> do you wanat to ask him out ot not?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> you really need to say how big it is
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> Just come right out and ask.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> you can't really motivate anybody unless they motivate themselves.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> With that said, yes, men do this just like I'm sure women do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> you really need to say how big it is
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> walk up to me and start making out with me
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> Just come right out and ask.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> you can't really motivate anybody unless they motivate themselves.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> With that said, yes, men do this just like I'm sure women do.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> Guys just know that treating girls like trash is ok because society says it is.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> its up to you guys to work things out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> maybe you should go out with your friend.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> YEAH I DO THAT ATOT AND I'M ONLY 15
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> if he won't tell you, then do some investigate yourself.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> hi... just close ur eyes ask urself.... r u in love?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> Not all women are like that.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> i love him , what should i do?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> I love good guys, which means that im bad....bwahahaah
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Not all women are like that.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> i love him , what should i do?
<NbChars_35> <LevSim_25> I love good guys, which means that im bad....bwahahaah
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> WELL WELL WELL... a question of the 90's  Well its not for me to answer but for you...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> but wut u need to kno is if he luvs her bck.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Well first off with your spelling what ever you do... do not write him a letter!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> nobody really has the answer for you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> I was just amazed I was having sex.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> The most important - DON'T PUSH HIM.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> what does a girl want from what???
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Yeah, give her the space she needs.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> If he thinks it's alright and you don't - that is on Oposite ends of the book.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> give him a break and just continue your friendship.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> A girl that loves car racing just like you do!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> He just wants to get some and move on.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> talk to him and let him know that you care about him
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> I always tried to remain friends with guys i dont see as potential boyfriends.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_15> LET GO,  GO WITH YOUR MIND AND NOT YOUR HEART.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> is her life worth going on with out her cheating husband i say yes.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> i think it is cheating because you are going behind your bboyfriends back with another man .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> KEEP AN EYE ON YOUR FRIEND SHE MAY WANT YOU FOR HERSELF
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> my friend has cought her boyfriend with emails to proove he has cheated on her.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> or if you want to do a quiet dinner at home, start thinking about the meal now.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> [it depends on if he gives me the creeps or not]
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> Ur friend wife is a freak.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> Ask him where this is coming from?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> i was with a woman who was just shy of 300lbs.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> I dont want to just be like a jerk about it.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> Learn to put that into words and WHAM!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> But it's not uncommon for a girl to watch porn.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Now go back to rocking quietly in your chair...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> IF that person was truely ur friend u never did wat u did.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> guys like girls for their simplicity, humor, intelligence.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> If you're your dad, it is.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> regroup, take time for self then date!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> Maybe she was the back up girl I dont know but I dropped him too,,,,
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> when, when u are absolutely positive u love him.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_60> open the car door for her.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> Actually to know me is to love me...lol,wanna see if what i say is true?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> trust me the guy wont mind.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> ALL MARRIAGES ARENT YOU HAVE TO MAKE YOUR MARRIAGE WORK AND MOST IMPORTANT COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR SPOUSE.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> Don't ask her friends, that's not very nice (what if she's not cheating on you?).
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> that's jus a little advice to help ya.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> because they are desperate and dont have a fu*k!n life
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> if she loves you back and you both want to be married then maybe -
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> He did behind ur back once why wouldn't he do it agoin.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> he is your friend he will never turn get over it and be a friend
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> I think it is the other way around
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> and do it cuz u like the guy not b-cuz u kno ur ex will get mad.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> all jokes aside, if you love him tell him .. true love will find a way
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> how can you say you love a person you don't know.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> compliment them on things besides their body.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> they want to have fun and feel relaxed with that person.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> KEEP A GOOD WATCH AND PAY ATTENTION TO HIS DEMEANOR.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> I have the same thing happing to me!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> No way i once dated a guy that bought me face wash for Christmas.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> should u that is entirely up to you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> I think thats why some guys like me.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> Talk to her... maybe she likes you too!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> Don't think about her, it just makes things worse.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> BUT IS SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE NEW AT THIS, SO YOU PROBABLY DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> How do i shake her off.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> sex i am a man and thats wat i wanted
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> how do i ask out a guy if i am a little shy around guys.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> I guess it's ok for the person that actually wants to date him for some reason.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Sounds to me as tho you are trying to get back at the world!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> ..ur heart will itself tell u.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> My advise is to tell her your feelings for her!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> but maybe u should just explore.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> My man bestfriend is a female, and I really don't have a problem w/ it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> People always want what they can't have.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> he simply will not do it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> If I like his hair and eyes, I am sooo in over my head!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> You should call the police and tell them that your boyfriend got stolen!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Thats where we learn about sex.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> I know where one great one is!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Well I look at him and deside if he is doable are not.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> Can he take an ED med like Viagra?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Tell him straight smack on his face!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> or can i do this to u now.... i would love to try that!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> I told the guy to chill out a little and maybe you should do that too!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> and find a new love or a hobbie you knw mingle
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Looks like gimpy's got you beat ;-) It's tough dating women online and then having them be a no-show.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Yall may end up getting married some day...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> jus take a deep breath and ask her out!!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> For example, if he comes home late, don't say, You're so rude and inconsiderate!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> the only way is to TALK
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> women who look like they don't wear makeup are much sexier.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> you cant do that when you are far apart.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> I once had a friend who's friend told her boss that her friend was dating the bosses friend.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> Your ex is just that...your ex.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> It's just not worth the hassle.
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_25> let him ask you the right thing later.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_35> you've lost a lover and a friend.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> Don't worry about it at all.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> depends...  most of the city girls :: cars, cash, bling2x
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> WHY IS THIS QUESTION ON SINGLES AND DATING ANYWAY??
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> who do u want to be with.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I got jealous of the girl I introduced him to.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> Like it is with us femals, some like skinny guys some bigger ones... etc.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> THEN go meet and find someone else u can trust and be happy with....
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> i repeat do not be annoying.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> IF YOUR SO HOT WHY CANT YOU FIND WOMEN BY YOURSELF INSTEAD OF ADVERTISING ON THE INTERNET?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> If people don't like that, it's their problem!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> He is a good guy though!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> U COULD MOVE ON WITH THE GROVE ON OK KICKK IT GIRL PS OUT YALL
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_25> But if he can't I suggest dump him!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> Nothing big, but it was a lie :(  Anyway, I don't think she liked it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> you cant tell simply by looking at him....... thats all a bunch of crap!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> If it keeps happening ask him what the hell is so important that this girls name keeps coming up.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> TALK TO HIM... Let him understand that what he did or say is wrong...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> u gain more out of love than lust   love rocks!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> if you are not exclusively dating someone, then have fun talking, flirting, hey dating other people.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> they say all is fair inlove and war .
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> depends on the catch.... nobody give you 14 million for nothing
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> you dont its not your buisness....your daughter needs to be the one looking in to it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> And a lot of men are the same way.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> What is she willing to do for you?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> On your birthday or the other persons birthday!
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_25> be there when he needs you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> sometimes i feel like punchin her friends but i never have and probably wont...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> But beware of what type of church you go to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> i had a friend swoop in on my ex the night we broke up.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> But i don't have a clue of what to say or who to tell.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> ITS TIME TO LET THAT FRIEND.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> It might behurt but you need to do what is best for you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> because rush of emotions come and go.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> i would, even if i had to brutaly murder some1s family and them.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> it really depends on how he is.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> We just have to learn how to pick the ones that are keepers before we sleep with them!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> just do it secretly, many do so but in secret ways
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> Besides - watch the old movie Revenge of the Nerds the main nerd scores with a super hot chick.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> I am just a dog, you know.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> And plus the whole i love u thing wears out if said to much anyway.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> However, if it is just chit chat and nothing sexual, i wouldn't worry any.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_55> that's what you should do give her some space.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> Not to be so direct but... tie your shoes alot!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> it cheaper to run you own through paper work and the mail.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> I once juggled 4 women for a few weeks ...... it just about killed me.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> for sure ull find a sweeet human being in me.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> Pretty women are pretty.... hardly dependant on their hair color.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> the only thing you can tell by looking at him is if hes hot and you want him!!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> If a man hit u once don't think for a chance that he wouldn't do it again.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> It's called IS SHE REALLY GOING OUT WITH HIM.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> i was born at night but, not last night!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> just tell her that maybe someone is waiting for her or fit for her than this guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> PS  They probably are NOT in love, you just think that.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_25> can you honestly be this naive??
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Come on give us a break were men.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> I know it sucks but sometimes you just need to do this.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> First get her permission, then use your LIPS!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> But I can't even get a guy to watch Brokeback Mtn with me (and none are homophobic).
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> God yeah, dont wanna make him think your frigid!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Ask him if he likes you then go on from there.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> If I was in her position I dont know ..
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> yes but that would be tough.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_15> yEAH WHEN I WAWS YOUNGER BUT THE QUESTION IS HAVE YOU????????????????
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> No, you obviously don't know the difference between they're, their, and there, so definitely NOT.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> hang in there, it'll be okay, it just takes time.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> your boyfriend loves you and you dont love him, damn are you cold hearted....lol just messing with you!!!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_50> beacause they can and there are plenty of willing women
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> I tried it and it worked so nicely.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> He might not be the type that likes chocolates or teddy bears so give him lots of sex.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> rarely does it work the way it's supposed to .
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> oh yeah, and some flowers.....the censored section says d i l d o
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> You're on thin ice here princess...you are, aren't you?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Gee, I'm glad I don't fit in that category!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> sometimes it works but sooner or later they will start actin mature...sooner or later.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> doggie style or on your side.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> move on theres somebody out there 10 times better !
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Or the two of you are too young.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> my ex didn't, but ya I beleive they can it depends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> You won't know, unless they tell you!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> i find that roofies work best for me
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> godwilling he will be there for u :) if NO then u know better what to do.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> may be yes ,,, some money problem....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> the suspition is in it's self a problem.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> Well he's pretty young to have one but anyway i'll tell u.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> OMG NO, any guy who plays you is a lying cheating butt!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> i don't think thats cool because they are going to wonder why.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> no its not correct u cant trust anyone like this
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> but so u know what some want.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> i dont see why he would break up with someone who he really likes.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Do you like working with little kids?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Just dont beat him at his own game *smile*
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> But once you do have sex, it's gonna hurt.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> does your friend  have to be muslim?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> You just have to know what you have and what you want to keep and don't back down.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> and for real, his looks will grow on you
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> It would not be good for you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> MAYBE WHEN GOD WAS PASSING OUT SAUSAGES HE RAN OUT AND GAVE YOU A WEENIE.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Yup, when I was a baby.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> The one with the good job.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Maybe u should talk to him and tell him how much u used to like it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> I dont want to be a lone for the rest of my life  I need some good answers.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Try being single, do what you want and have some fun.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> Don't feel bad If they don't say hi !!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> WOW, I am glad you are not my friend.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> what i mean by this is he be falling for you then you be falling for him!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> dont talk crap, cause it will turn around and bite cha in the butt.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> my wife admits to humping a pillow when she was 6
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> just kidding, but seriously how could anyone really describe what love is?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Its seems like your mister popular now!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> It may be a slow process cuz love doesnt just HAPPEN!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> So I found myself again, relearned all my mannerisms, and I tried to go out with other men.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> well do run away and then live good with his beep
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> Any ideas what this dream means?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> pleasuring yourself by playing with your genitals until you get off
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> to not hurt there filling you should simply ask them
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> I think it said it was like $500, but it was pretty cool how accurate it was.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> You don't need that, no one does.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> u cant all ways hate thim
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> yes, girl show him who he is in ur life...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> If he leaves wont you wonder what could have happend?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> Just don't forget one thing, that people DO CHANGE.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> that's why i don't have lover.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> This works most of the time...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> of course no one know.How about I give you an idea, just go ask her..........!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> like, once the tax period is over.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> could be ,u never know what could be going through our minds.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> Complex question... go here to read why I say so.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> When you always try to be close to someone.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> u never had sex or...u r underage....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> no you weren't wrong at all, if you don't want to then don't do it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> go somewhere where u can actually talk alot and laugh try starbucks
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_55> i did at age 10 1/2
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> I know how tough it is!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> and you can see if can meet some from you father's frieds sons or your mather's friends sons
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> i AM VERY SAD.SHOULD I TELL MY FRIEND HOW I FEEL?
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_30> it's life, you have to take a chance.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> No, but I love that song!!!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> It's the first steps of love, you should enjoy it!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> Ouch, thats my biggest turn off.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> have you been walking up to strange women and kissing them?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> Personally I don't really care if they have a job, just as long as they get one soon.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Thats my problem with my jackass exboyfriend!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> but im telling you both is going to end up being hell.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> 14 is too young.. you just dont know the consequences that might happend to you, save it..
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> I almost always (9 out 10) give money .
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> because the girls get into more  in   love  and  in   the  relatiionship
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> I really don't like this,  am I wrong for being extremely mad?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> That tells me the girl isn't interested.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> she will come sooner or later.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> neither find a girl that has done it once or twice.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Don't let your husband ruin your's and baby's life.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> Unless, of course, you're old with money...lol.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> no, im kind of curious though.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> if you are 21 you really dont have to tell her.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> he might get scared and it would be weird afterwards if he doesn't like you back.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_20> i am right there in the confusion with you.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> same thing usually with girlfriends and boyfriends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> no cause you two were not going out anymore
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> she didnt mean to but it happenes in life!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> Sounds like you should wait until you find someone you love.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> same thing usually with girlfriends and boyfriends.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> no cause you two were not going out anymore
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> she didnt mean to but it happenes in life!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> Go somewhere fun Where You can laugh.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> what are some ways i can make my boyfriend happy?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> Go a noch out of ur way so that he can see ur about something.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> I think its there way of saying they like you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> MOVE ON (and don't forget the punch him part.)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Dont try and look for an older guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Flirting is just fun and doesnt necessarily mean anything.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> IF you have to ask where babys come from.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> but do a cross of sounding smart but with acting stupid.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> It is best to ask your mother that question!
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_35> has anyone done or witnessed this before?
<NbChars_255> <LevSim_25> Ever think of addoption..or get a pet!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> hire a cute babysitter, then take the kids to a movie.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_30> But I say it's mostly about The nookie (come on!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> uh no, i have nothing against them but i wouldnt pick them over someone else
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> Also, another thing is that I probably wouldn't have married him if I wasn't pregnant.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> He used to cheat?.....as in more than once?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> And, no, I'm not trying to be sarcastic, I'm really curious...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Instead of flirting with them, acting cool, and interesting, they just act stupid!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> She goes in this I hate men website.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> Don't mess with her and talk to your wife.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> Next time you see him, ask him out!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> i will tell u after u do it wth me 2 lol
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> you and your boyfriend aren't really fighting.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> if  you  werent  to  gether  it  wasnt  cheating.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Leave that man and new girl alone!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> types of hugs gentle or strong or strong with grabbing of her butt.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> The weather is so variable I can't imagine why you would put your family and friends through this.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> i am widowed and i am definitely not looking forward to valetines day :(
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> go and find a new and fresh boyfriend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> (if you have a good smile) lol women know when men are trying to get with us.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Suttle ways: massage her hair while rubn your hand along her leg.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> they could break your heart without even trying too.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> Girl- You know this one is bad news.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> having a penus put into my p*ussy
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> it could go the other way though.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Well if he closed that IM fast like you said, he obviously has something to hide.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> after being together for 3yrs, its still great.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> I hate the whole demanding diva routine!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Quit beating yourself up over this.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> what about a man who has beeen seperated form hos wife for 6 yrs.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> (was that short and to the point?)
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> bcuz its sick looking and just gross
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> Yes, I love my self me and I
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> it depends does he help out you and your children?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> all you got to do is put this loser behind you .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> If you go to the movies, you really can't do much but sit and watch.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> and you need to take a moment and look at your life and reclaim your identity.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> When u feel to kiss some one.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> thats the best thing u can do...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Just be honstely with her tell to hold on u think she nice and u want ask her out.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> how should i approach her next time i ask her?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> if she says 'no-i have a bf' ask if she didn't have a bf-would she consider it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> you will just end up hurting a virgin and you wont even feel it with a pornstar.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> unless your into hurting people then go with the virgin.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> I had mine at 11 With Meredith my Baby Whaich iam happily married to Now I LOVE HER
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> :0(  DO THE BEST WITH WHAT YOU HAVE,THERE IS NOT MUCH YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Gotta be in the bathroom on an airplane.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> if you find one, let me know and hopefully we can hook up and chat.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> I know my wife reads all my obnoxious comments on this answers stuff...  yea  word
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> u know u dont need details!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> a kiss and a rose bud!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> go after him, dont lose him!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> its not cheating if you were not together
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> buy him a new car if you can afford
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> Just don't get married right away.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> be yourself dont go out of you way to impress her .
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_35> you are too young to have a baby .
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> One of them probaly likes u and if they don't they are just too much into your life.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> ASK HER IF SHE'D LIKE TO GO OUT FOR A CUP OF COFFEE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I would never even consider going gay, I don't think I'd watch Brokeback Mtn either...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Do you want a guy like that?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> So...when THE BIG BIRTHDAY ARRIVES...what am I supposed to do?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> hope you are lucky enough to experience it
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> Just be yourself and sombody will love you just the way you are.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> you never love the same way twice.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> MUST I BE ALONE FOREVER MORE??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> love is something which i lost 26 days ago
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> be careful with the women becasue sometimes they do not know what they wants.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> by what youve said here , why would you want to be with him after this ?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> you should ask yur friends to stop and tell them it isn't funny.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> yes and no u can set them up in dates but its up to ur best friend
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> give him that records..and dump him!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> you never know until you try
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> If you honestly like him then I say go for it.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> But that may be just me.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Get your self busy, is the best way.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> to worry or should i just give up and let him work things out on his own?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i broke up with him on monday the 23rd.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> For boys, i like etnies, or vans, and i am a girl.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> then you put mr happy up in it until you both have a happy ending.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> i wood give u a hug but i don think its humanly possible to do that through the internet.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> I learned what and where I went wrong and now, We're back together!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> They make us get a hard on
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Join a club, take a class, etc...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Natalie just seems like the right one!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> i'm sorry to say that u'll never win her love since u didn't even have it from the beggin!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> do the best for your child if nothing else .
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> you can go to chat-avenue .com its fun for all ages.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> MEBE  BUT   IT   COULD    ALSO   BE  THAT   SHE  MISSES  BEING   AROUND  YOU.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> certainly ... this is the time when one should explore the new corners and funs of life.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Honestly I think most couples dont register anymore because they really do just want cash .
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> No, wait while u can because when u get hooked u get hooked.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> BUT IF THEY DONT COME JUST KNOW THAT IT'S THEIR LOST NOT YOURS.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> first stop flirting and then ask him what his intentions are.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> but that's b/c they're still in school too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i am sorry for both of you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> This begs bigger questions - like is your girlfriend truly untrustworthy or are you just a control freak?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> i find it really childish but the problem is i really really love him soo much.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> no cause you to are not together anymore
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> funny, caring, and good looking, someone who says i'm pretty, not hot.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> ohhhh yeah latins are hot and as a lover mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> You mean BOB - battery operated boyfriend
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> evidently he falls really easy but you have to be the judge of that one!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> and i hate these kinds of questions.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> WHY NOT , YOU WILL ENJOY IT JUST AS MUCH AS HIM, !
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> What happens when men go hunting?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> try something new, if you know what i mean.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> Ask her have you ever thought of how it feels to be like me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> Sit in front of him and give him a foot massage.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> Man you really hit a low note with this question.If its in this section i guess your a stalker,right?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> you kno wat if a women emailed you she'd be crazy because what kind of guy does that.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> Like before we even went out.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> And you had sex with another guy for 1 day.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> Yo, don't fall for it again!!!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> but i'm a fat, mean lesbian.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> Just not sure what you are looking for here.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> dont lie , tell him you are bored ..
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> Money and a nice care always works!
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_20> that's kinda gross actually, i think that it's not true love couze its a fart lol
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> knowing that the guy wants to spend time wiht them and the way they look at their women
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> theres one around the coner aiting for you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> No way you could really be dating some wirdo murder!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> I HATE olives, but some men love them!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> that's kinda gross actually, i think that it's not true love couze its a fart lol
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> theres one around the coner aiting for you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> No way you could really be dating some wirdo murder!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I HATE olives, but some men love them!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> What if the guy you like gets mad and doesn't want anything to do with you anymore?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> do alot of it....just dont be a tease.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> even in highschool they act stupid to impress girls.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> You called him a BOY so I'm guessing that you already know the answer
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> when you dont want one,  you dont notice anyone elses interest.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> SO TELL YOUR FAMILY YOU LOVE THEM AND BE HAPPY.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> you do it like they do on the discovery channel
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> yes, without commitment there would be no love?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> baby girl ur looking in all the wrong places i'm right here
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> i asked wat present should i give a guy,  two of the answer were head.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> if she says 'no'-then walk away.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> what i would'ent give to be her thong.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> NOthing is worth taking yor own life.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> What the guy looks like would not be a big deal, but his personality would matter.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> You chat with him a lot.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> it's not like you were still with him and you slept with this other guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> ask is not the best place to be getting this stuff.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> Only long enough to wrap you back in!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> so my final answer would be hell no
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> Some guys are just scared others are taken.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Girl, I think you just need to cut it, but that's just me.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> GO UP TO HIM AND ASK HIM ''DO YOU STILL LIKE ME OR WHAT?''
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> IF NOT THEN SIT DOWN WITH HIM TALK OUT YOUR FEELING.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> more than half of lovers find other ways to enjoy themselves!!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> 8 secs is a good ride.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> Also...you should really be asking you friends this!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> i dont think love has a time limit at all.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> next year it's his turn to hire a sitter, then you take the kids to a movie
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> SOME PEOPLE HAVE TO HELP THERE OWN SELF AND YOU CAN NOT HELP HIM.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> 4eva is a long time, could he be serious, don't be blind of nice words
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> oysters,  pumpkins seeds by the hand full
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> i agree with sonflower, if you wanted him you wouldn't have cheated.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> dont wait untill after, it would be rude to do so!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> HIs or yours i dont know
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> a  mans words give out alot of him self.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> ooo that would be funny lol but the girl should be his fiance.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> no, he only want to fuck you
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_35> Yes I consider myself to be a good lover--I just know it--
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> But really sweetie.. if this guy can't see what a beautiful person you are he isn't worthy of you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Have u every asked yourself do u really like this new guy or do u just wanna get revenge.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> I think he really loves u now so when ur alone ask him or phone him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> I once took out an amazingly hot young woman.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> you are your own woman, if he wants to think that is cheating, then that's his loss...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> It kinda sounds like she wants you to make the choice!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> i would probably say carnival cruise lines.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Some women (and men) just like to flirt.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> I feel bad for you little guy
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> Don't worry about what's gay and what's straight, just like who you like and do what feels right.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> At certain ages and imaturity, hard testicles is always a problem!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> you are to gay men, that's for sure
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> I say it cheatin is wrong no mater what reason you have.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> no dudes dont dig that shit
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Mines is big...okay no its not.But I have a guy.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> But hey i've dated woman and they can be lunatics.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> Get her really drunk and attempt to make out with her.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> she'll realize it and tell her no matter what you'll be there for her.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> And you're an amazing lover if you can simultaneously climax!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> if he has been in love three times did he lose his love to death or break up?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> ask her and when you do, do it with compasion and look her in the eyes.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> if that picture is giving you discomfort, why not tell him?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> so my best wishes for u both !
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> he might not want her to be with you and that how?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> if i dated someone simply because of their looks, which i dont, i probably would dump them.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> thats  kinda  sterotyipical   dont  you  think?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> ANd then he thinks i am faking it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> But i'll say it, get rid of him!!!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> IF YOU TRY TO GET HIM SOMETIME AND HE ALREADY HAS IT HE COULD ALWAYS HAVE TWO OF IT!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> you have to think about wich you like more or don't date ether of them pick some one else
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> Get rid of your past demons (why do you not like women?)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> So I'm guessing the sex won't either.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Have you ever even heard of that Sir-Mix-a-lot song?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I decided I wanted him back.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> He sounds like my ass of a cheeting ex.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> CHECK THEY UNDERWEAR,  IF YOU SEE BLOOD THERE YOU GO.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Or, you could just ask him if he likes you like a real girlfriend.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> like if it is to the point where you have think about someone else during sex to get off....
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> any volunteer moms need a baby like me?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> Just think of the type of reception you want.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> they want waht they cant have
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_10> JUST PUT YOUR BOOT IN HIS BUT AND SAY HOLLA
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> he loves me but I do not find him phyisically attractive.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> All you other kids, grow up yourselves.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Hopefully you like the person a lot.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> just be true to your heart!!!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> i have been in a situation like that before, and yes you need to worry.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> nobody said love was easy, and it certainly is not!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> i think she is smat but she acts like she is stuped.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> If he played with you last year .. he will play with you this year.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> well sum gurl do but not all gurls
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> of course it is the only way to go for me...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> its nice to hav a girl with a big butt, they are the easiest to get a piece of.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> kind of like asking a doctor to be a good patient... right?
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> the real question is can't u wait?!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> but that doesn't mean that your boyfriend should/wants to know about it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> WHAT SHOULD I DO/ HE'S ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR KIDS IN SCHOOL, WHAT IF HE DOSEN'T LIKE ME?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> Its seems like everything has to be some great contest....like love.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Sorry couldn't tell you the signs, cuz I missed them.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i would do the same thing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Oh, don't do this; it's illegal.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> weel ya if he had a good explanation.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> girl i doubt hat its going to be a problem in the future.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> i would deffinantly get checked out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> depends on how capable you are  !!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> do what you want and screw the other people.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> its nothing u can do but deal with it or leav
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> ask him about it and if he becomes upset then 9*10 he is doing it.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> umm yeah you might be getting played here.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I say love, it is a flower,  And you it's only seed.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Honey if you are asking this question then you already know the answer!

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> aks a guy out on that day and u will feel happy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> See, guys are scared of sex by trait, women are not.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> sure....keep in mind everything is a social construct...love when your're ready for it teen or not.

<NbChars_250> <LevSim_25> Could it be you and not him????
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> if you feel its right then get married, if not dont, because divorce wastes a lot of money.

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_5> YOU ARE GOING TO GO BLIND DUDE!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_25> find a nice guy for yourself ^_^.

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> do we like espacially european girls?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_10> LEARN HOW TO USE WHAT YOU HAVE  WELL,AND BECOME A MASTER IN O*AL SEXX.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> He needs to knock that shit off and act like a man!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> At least not for a while, anyway.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> no you dumb *itch, haha I know her, tell her to *uck off
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> She doesn't need friends like that...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> because you can not do it as good as BIG MOMMA.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> you should only give him a kiss if he acts like he wants to kiss you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> If she looks sweet dont use tongue and if she looks like a stripper use tonque.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> YOU NEED TO TAKE CARE OF YOU AND NOT HIM RIGHT NOW.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> I don't have a problem with gay women...I know they like me.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Just kidding, no it's totally ok to be gay.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_15> JUST ASK HER 4 HIS E-MAIL !
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> i hope so if nothing else god loves u

<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> It can only lead to bad vibes and bad office talk!!!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> I squirt, and I'm not ashamed; of course, I'm a guy...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> :)  You'll know true love when you get there!

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> be super nice to her and do whatever she wants and never lie or do anything bad to her
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> It sounds strange, but most people don't want to sit through the wedding anyways!

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Usually when I talk about someone a lot it means that I'm thinking about that person a lot.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> i dont know im still trying to figure that out for myself
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> The thing is, I never get to see any of it.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_55> It's just that hotel rooms and girlfriends go absolutely PERFECT together...like peanut butter and jelly!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> It was so funny tho because they look EXACTLY alike.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> it probaly couldnt hurt to visit tho but dont move in.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> Am I kidding myself about being gay?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> NO, I HAVENT YET, BUT I WOULD IF MY PARTNER WANTED TO.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> he alwayz calls me his buddy but he kinda gets on my nerves.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> AN APPLE CAN LOOK GOOD ON THE OUTSIDE, BUT CAN BE COMPLETELY ROTTEN ON THE INSIDE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> dont give him impression that, u wnat to go sexually with him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> don't let other people who you should date or like.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> let him to injoy u in bed
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> do we really need another person who calls himself a pimp?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Well if some 1 like u they really don`t care how u look.

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> he left you because variety  is interesting and something is missing.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> U deserve anything u could ever wish for.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> wait for sometime , if u r destined to fall into real-love, thats wat u call it , right?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> jus let him know he would tell u how he feel
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Is it her or you that has no desire for the other one.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> First off, if he's stupid enough to cheat, hes not good enough for you!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> hi  do most of the activities as if near to her but dont talk .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> You fix it- what is marriage all about anymore- didn't you make a vow (jennifer Lopez)!!

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Is she playing with her hair and at times bashfully looking away?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> some things you just have to realize for yourself.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Y does she purposly try to get me mad?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> give me the links of tutoring in wat r the positions in sexing!!!!!!!

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Did you ever think to just ask?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Good luck, and dont give up- these things take time!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> She saw something she wanted and she went after it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> its just about our favorite part a girls body!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> go to clubs and find friends
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> I like big butts, and i cannot lie!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> heck no... you have to test the water to make sure you know what your getting in to lol....

<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> im not gay but i'd go for jessica alba anytime...lol
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> Are all 3 of u in love, or is it just sex.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> If you want me, you have to ask me out in person.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> i has so many girls friends but i don't  have any lover.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Is it that hard to fine a good friend there?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> but its also possible you might have something hanging out of you nose.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> Just think about what she'd like best.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> dating is just having fun yaar!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> why would you give of yourslef of your body to someone you dont love?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> YES IT IS  FUN BRINGING THEIR PERSONBALITIES OUT
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> none of that really matters but its always a plus but most girls go for the personality
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> ok if u want we can do it in style :drealsunny@yahoo.com
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_35> first u need the look, then the additude(not spelled right-right?)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> havent done that but i would if my partner really wants it..
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> he loves me for me, for who i am as a person.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> my girl friend is the best..
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> all up to you,but if your in no hurry and she is make her file
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> If he don't like you, then its possible that he has his own reasons.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> a candle, something with a sesual scent, like mint.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> YOU WILL KNOW WHEN IT HAPPENS TOO !
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> if he plays with your heart, he doesn't like you at all.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> kiss her when you are in the nude
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Don't bother with people who even know him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Just think back to when you first started having sex.... how did you act?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Her sister really sux and so does her dad Homer.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> confidence is sexy, anything else is an accessory, but certainly nice touches.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> i dnt kno i do those all tha time dont mean nuhin 2 me.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> A lady never tells her age!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Did you hear shes considering a boob job?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> he is geting bord with her but he sill likes her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Your wife will be the one you spend the rest of your life with, not your mommy or daddy.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> I will be your net friend if you be mine yes or no: Jaleshia101@yahoo holla at me baby boy
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> $100 says that your a chick and the 55 year old is a guy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> nothing,never mind that kinda friend,lots of people here wants to have more friends and i am one of those...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> umm no.. stop asking dumb questions!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> if you do not love why would you cheat?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> remember..  no man is an island..(--,)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> and I'm still with him :-)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> what sucks is when you see her with another guy and your like... mmmm must do something.. NOW!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> the gambling part is : maybe he does love you too, just like you still love him
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> That or maybe try using a big club!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> hey listen... go n talk to ur man!!

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> jennifer lopez seems to be doing well.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> I am going to say proably not.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> it probaly wont be a problem if u really like the guy

<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> He didn't and is DIRT for doing something like that to you!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> without any hassels of dating sites.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> It's like gambling for a husband.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> so i guess actually none of them
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> Plus, you can do the Wanna have lunch?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> (And prayer is a great way to start - I'll certainly be praying for you!)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Letters are a winner - everyone loves to get 'snail mail'
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> dont love him,he will fall 100%
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> No he's not cute he's absolutely sexy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Which ideas that both of you guys are comfortable to do.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> i would be with my best friends .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> Cheating only applies for married people, but with boy and girlfriends, it doesn't matter.....but of course it is painful
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_50> her eyes, then hands, then hair, then shape of body,
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> But  just dont know  what to do?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> i like the butt i think it is the first thing i look at first
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> what do u mean by additude
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> its a way of flirting ,thats for shure.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i look just like my avatar and i have a 6 pack.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> there are black women that prefere white men.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Hope this helps a little ..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> DO GIRLS REALLY THINK LIKE THAT OR ITS JUST ME.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Everytime I buy him something I always have to take it back b/c he already has one!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> start dating u can ask them u know
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> I love those English guys 2.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> we also save them to read months & years later!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> Its only your hormones going all wacko
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> if she is really a good friend then she'll listen to you.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> get in the kitchen and fix me a sandwich, thats how i usually say it.........LOL
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> depends how u look like blonde long hair ect.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> He might not buy it even then, but that's the only thing I can think of.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> Because such women themselves are losers!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> THIS LOOKS LIKE A GUY CHOICE TO MAKE!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> but try and put a spin on it.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> ull know ull know dont worry and have fun
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Show her all there is to see.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> they just want for us to get confused!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> if she says 'yes'-that kinda sucks.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> this isn't always going to be true though.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> A lot of girls like fat guys ;)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> to me dirty feet from a woman is because men don't like to suck stinky toes
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> My friend just had to remove the sleves and the bow and make it shorter cuz im short
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> yes ofcourse ilove you just u are any more
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> if they dont like it then you know where they stand in your life.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I didn't think it was particularly romantic if thats what you are asking...
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_25> we where married at 2 months.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> you have to tell him that he confuses you a lot.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> I would pick a guy with the great personality, i mena looks and moneya re just bonus.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> if you need to ask,you probably aren't old enough.

<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Most guys think about sex every 3 seconds.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> What ever you do don't go to the movies.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> if he dumps you over that the loose him cause he's not good enough.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> And the same old tired answer .... TIME!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> But do u really want to be with someone that cheats?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> If you dont know how to flirt maybe youre too young?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Don't give up on him just yet!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> so be careful on who you trust.

<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> is that person a good friend of his/hers????
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> such as bowling, tennis, rock climbing..    chatting over some drinks or food?
<NbChars_40> <LevSim_20> lolz licking touching kissing rubbing smelling feeling  mmm
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> So swim on back to sea, orcas.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> is it me or is it everyone else?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> Go for another love.... he's not so real...
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> A song by Haddaway from the 80's:)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> I mean, what if you would send for one and he would turn out to be a real jerk?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> If he does not want you then send him to hell and get on with yourself girl.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> If I only had the answer to this question...I would be rich...lol!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> if so talk to her on her level even though its not your style.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> There are 2 kinds of women, b***hes and sl*ts.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Dancing, horseback riding, sitting on the beack, reading, whatever.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Unless of course if u are just searching for a mother-material only, u can just try nanny services.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> when you want a bf your senses for that are heightened.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> a lil after that he was trying to feel on and i told him  no.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> You don't deserve the wife you have now buddy!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> BUT REMEBER THAT YOUR ALWAYS BEAUTIFUL NO MATTER WHAT!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> who cares let her learn on her own or are you the sister keeper huh?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> you and me  used to be we are not one so i have to run!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> No matter what he looks like?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> as long as it takes to keep this house for your kids
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> do ya think its true that men times by 3 and women divide by 3 admitting sex partners..
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> At the movies you can't talk.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> That depends on alot of thing!
<NbChars_250> <LevSim_35> make her think ,maybe she'll come around.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> Goggle Light Her Fire  It works.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> because the think with their little head instead of their big head!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> I don't know I have neevr had sex.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_45> But do it in caring way.

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> love is metter of heart.it can be in just in a wink of eyes
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> first of all there is no easy way to dump some one its going to hurt no matter what.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Even when I was pregnant with our baby!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> I guess I should express that sort of thing more often...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> but dont let him find out for a long while...
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> um.... let's see about this can u find me?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> When youre not married, its wrong either way.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> i have always loved my girl friend to depth of my heart.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> answer me that then i can answer yours.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> watch hitch and then ull understand
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> why would you want to defeat it?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> there are no limits to your style, so have fun!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> (i'm always sure to return the favor)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> get in his head 1st !!!!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> Then ask her when that bug up her ass is going to die.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> he is going to complain .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> If you did that then you really don't like him!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> It depends on how old you are!!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> it depends on the age I guess...what are the ages?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> (hopefully his name is not john - or it could be the same man).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> your talking to one u weirdo
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Chances are he just wants to mess with you again.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Well...it seemed pretty sad if you have sex with someone you don't feel anything...(like one night stand).
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> hide in the closet spy on em
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> then their is my bf, who buys me whatever i want.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> You sound like you are sort of on the side.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> i want to be a young parent for my kids.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> all i can say is go for it if you really like her
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Lastly...only you can choose how this will go.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> My boyfriend is the HARDEST guy to shop for!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> who in they right mind want to fight everyday?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Hey everybody agrees and the answer is NO.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> if she says 'yes i want go out with you'-then she's a cheater.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> First why did you cheat on him in the first place?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> Or do I just find a friend?
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_15> THANX FOR ASKING HOWS UR SEXY LIFE?
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_25> have treats and gifts laid out.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> invite him to hang out with you and go get coffee or something, its a start.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> and its the best thing i could have done for myself .
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Many guys talk that way (like i miss you and so) when they don't mean it.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> Take the kids and leave, man.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> That girl has got it all!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> I enjoy laying my face on my guys chest and with hair there i wouldn't enjoy it at all.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> and next thing i know we're dating.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> and that is very important to me.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> PLEASE LET ME GET CHAT ROOM EN ESPANOL
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> well, proper hygiene is still important!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> mom of 3 (11,7, and 3) and a single parent at that.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> You wont be sorry you tried it out, i promise.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> No, but a lot of my best friends are going to hell.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> maybe she doesnt mean to but if she does this is not good news at all.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> u should tell them now that you are moving!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> Look homie, you shouldn't try to change any girl!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> god made them hot for a reason o_O
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Rent a porn movie that has some scenes/positions that you like.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> most of the time it is someone that has been hurt bad in the past.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> so he got mad a left.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> don't want to pay for a sit down mean for all the guests, have a buffet!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> Ive never cheated and neither has she.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Maybe stay home, maybe go out to eat, etc.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> give up on trying to understand em and just do your best to love the one u got
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> the worst that can happen is he says he doesnt like you...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> I have been threw so much of my own its UN REAL!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Learn a martial art like karate
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> what u need to do is stop searching so desperetly.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> But don't ever get in the middle of it, with him there.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> Hey girls i think shas211 is asking guys.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> because i feel that a sign of disrespect and ignorance.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_20> i had the same problam                                                                 bye!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> i doubt that's your cup of tea, darling.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> Good luck, but also keep your eyes peeled for other girls around you too!
<NbChars_300> <LevSim_20> say i love u & kiss her
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> take a pill put some water on it and watch it grow
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_35> no not unless ur a neat freak
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> Don't believe a word he says
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> my advice is to stay that way for life.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> If it was a person I already knew and trusted, it would be great!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> he also said marriage is not for hime even though i would make a great wife.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> But it sounds like you don't have enough courage to just GET OUT!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Does he seem to want to come back?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> I see some have said disgusting Bull, I would not feed my baby anything disgusting, it lovely, natural milk.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> i think very very far than u  think
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> no i like my girl th way she is smart funny ...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Would you like to go out with a guy that you don't like?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> i couldn't choose one - my guy has to have at least something in each category.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Then get a girl to come in acting like a stripper...teasing him with a feather.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> Dont get mad until your married and he still has them.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> the hard answer (no pun intended):  take up some advanced meditation.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> but everytime i try to hang out with her she never answers me.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_40> wait......let me think, oh.. about you guys nope i have no idea what are you talking about.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Just thought I'd bring up the other side, stir things up a bit!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> do you hear women asking about virginity of a guy?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> If not, then don't be with him.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> And what ppl can do to other ppl is straight BS.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Quit planning every minute of your life.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> i give this question about 24 hours before they delete it but any way here goes.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> yes if u hav marriage certificate or any valid proof of wedding then its valid in any country.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> If not, that's ok, but I want to be clear.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_20> Quit planning every minute of your life.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> the best way is to get a prostitute.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> but use to see them in the shower at school.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> how do i make it stonger??
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> I may be wrong, i dont  know.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> Sit her down and tell her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> seems you already have one important thing in common.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> You are better off happy without an Idiot guy than miserable with one!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> you dont have to do anything that you arent ready to do.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> i guess so, but avatars make anyone look awsome.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> If it doesn't bother him..then yes he wants to be JUST FRIENDS..
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> if your kind, funny, and everything listed above then to me that is without a doubt the best kind.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Long ones, short ones, mushy ones, just to say I Love You, just cuz it's Wednesday, etc.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> I know thismight be sad news to you, but somebody's gotta tell it.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> may be a life you date somebody and dont know him /her
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> Be happy that you have a great guy, don't b shallow.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> I which I could still produce so I could use some during intercourse....... LOL !!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> or does he collect from BIG MOMMA?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> buy him a blow up doll to play with until you're ready.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> (LOL unless we cheated, lied, or etc.)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> But since you are unable to change anything that is already happened...why not forgive & forget...
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> a good friendship always last long                       to a friend                              by vedakumar
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Yeah you can love somebody within like a week well depending on how old u r i guess
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Can't live in the home they use to and etc...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> To ur second, I must say no, dont trust him!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> its a vicious cycle.. i feel dejected...sometimes i think im crazy..i jus wanna be normal..
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Everyone pretty much summed it up.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> only kiss when it's someone you love.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> but i dont know if he did or not cuz right now he's jobless!

<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> No offense, but get your head out of your *ss!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> There is nothing wrong in it
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> and if he disagress juz b his friend!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> Cuz a girl like that, probably other guys will like her too.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> Why does their have to be a racial issue with love?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> You don't won't him to hate you.

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> 14 INCHES LONG AND 6 INCHES THICK.ANYTHING BELOW THIS IS A GIRLY MAN.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> ya sometimes make sure that the personne is safe and meet the personne somewhere with ur freind or something
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> accidently spilling something on her or urself.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> you need to play his game girl!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> ask her that u like me or not?simple
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> time and something to take your mind of it during that time
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> Come on, vote on the question already!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> DONT WORRY THEY'LL LET YOU KNOW, JUST PAY CLOSE ATTENTION.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Once you get past that it would go to personality.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> and you need to be mature to love somebody for more than just their butt.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_10> WHENEVER U FEEL THAT THE TIME IS RIGHT DON,T TAKE IT ANY FUTHER THOUGH.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> The only thing i would like to say is DIFFENTIATE BETWEEN DATING AND LOVE!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> I would go for the guy
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Cuz boys are looker and women are emotional
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> Us, girls dont deserve that kinda sh*t!

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> The theory that black guys have bigger, you know what, is just a myth!!!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Rubing on him and all that good stuff.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> Over dinner I asked about her father.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> it can't be fix, if you dont want to be with a man then just be alone  for ever
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> another idea is mix-n-matching your colors (ex.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> if the answer from ur heart is YES then go for it !
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> and like, he used to be one of my best guy friends EVER.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> what do u call  small ??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> If package refers to the heart, then NO WAY small packages work with me!
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_35> Run, don't walk and find a new guy.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_50> Most lesbians would rather stay at home at watch a movie...
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_45> take a chance you only live once!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_60> Believe it or not, they aren't.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_40> I like a woman who has some meat but not fat.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> my eyes dont do that :)
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> Yo dog, if you're worried about that...
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> As for feelings;.......you will lose all feeling in your nose if you say nothing....................!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> if it doesn't work, then he'll be gone and you won't have to worry about it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> not that my dad would let me!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> It sounds like you already have thought about leaving.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> same here im hot still no love
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> She is straight and I am not.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> in any event-give it a shot.
<NbChars_270> <LevSim_20> He knows I do not play!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Yall both must like each other.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> you really didn't give enough information to get a good answer
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> I've got two kids, so I say two.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Lots of great chat rooms with tons of people actually on cams.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> sometimes people get love comfused with sex
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> she looks boring,way too naif and silly
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> As long as you love him, then ok.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> I dated hot and not so hot and i still didnt find the right guy.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> Have even thought about just staying single????
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> get a time machcine an warp backwards 1 year
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Maybe there is another guy out there who isn't too blind to realize what a great girl you are.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> You can have sex but should you?????
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> But somehow I get the idea someone sick is going to tell you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> I fell in love w/ a hot gurl, but I see her holding hands w/ him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> c'mon, sooner or later you'll have to ask him about his status !
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> One thing like that would be yahoo answers.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> IM CONFUSED AND HURT, HE STILL WANTS TO BE BEST FRIENDS,
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> If she is just an a$$, then there you go.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> i havent done it yet but im going to.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> there's more to life then we will both discover.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> U will know when u r being presented wth some!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> no you guys were already broken up werent you?
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> what was the craziest song uv ever had sex to?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> no if u feel its right
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> (being cute is not very important but if they are... all the better)  just hope this helps ya!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> Hope I gave you some other ideas :)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> Joe didn't and that is why he is gone.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Don't you want to grow up
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> once or twice a week..sometimes more, sometimes less...depends on the couple.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Get out now while your young and have a chance to start over wiser...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Hey about my question...any clue where the guys in your hood get their flares?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> its really not a big deal, never was.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> He wouldn't even give me a chance to miss him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> its a challenge for them so thats why they like you when you are taken already.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Its hard believe me I know
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Well they don't and whoever thinks that is just a sexist pig!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> you kno cuz they dont think that they're the s**t or anything.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_65> tell her that in your opinion, her bf is trying to control her and you can see that.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> think deeply about what the day really means.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> U have to be honest that's better just say xxx u r bad...
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> I am looking for that real love, like in The movie The Note Book.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> you can try cosmopolitian (the magazine)
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_25> And watch your back while you are leavin'.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> i mean, did he give this to you (a girl, I assume) after breaking up, or what?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> If she doesn't like it, F her.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> A GUY THAT CAN BE SWEET SO I GUESS THE SECOND 1.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> i'm not sure its been 2 years and he still tries to weazle his way back in my life
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> Tooo late.............maybe you just learned something
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> so if you find out first it will be better, especially if she does!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Tell him, if not you will live the rest of your life wondering What if... Good Luck!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> If he cannot see what an amazing wonderfull smart gal you are DUMP HIM!!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> When you don't have to ask.. u just kinda know..
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> if i really love her i wouldnt mind even if she has 15 kids
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> we don't want to pay for your dumb a** because you got yourself buntis.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> take her out, make her laugh, and have a good time.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_10> PLEASE DON`T ,DO US ALL THAT FAVOR
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> Probably cruel but hey it works.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> he have to don that his self.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Did he really do those things... Do you really want him back..?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> its not the best thing  to do.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> I have no idea what to do?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> Cut him off and don't give him anything.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> Now I get laid a lot more and do what I want when I want to!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> then the money, the ride and then the H-O-3s lol
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> save the pic as a .jpg.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> try to keep her occupied with other things - help keep her mind off of it..
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> Second rule: don't do it like in the movie The Bachelor.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_60> because they have nothing better to do but make girls confused!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> hips and even a tummy roll are ok.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> when the right girl comes around, youll know.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Didn't you just ask this question?
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_40> If you have to ask .
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> that would depend on what It you are talking about
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Never buy a chick you just met at a bar a drink.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> hell yea man, take that ball and run with it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> girls who wear no bra or panties and jiggle all over the place.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> a nice hand made card that saids all the good things about him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> hey a friend r one who shares hs joys and sorrows.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Is it so bad to be gay?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> i just hope theres not expensive furniture around.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> it means that you have never done dirty things and sex 2
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> ...It's more important  - what you think?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> no, but thanx for the offer.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> You're a whiner... she'll never want you b/c women hate whiners.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> I don't want to just give him gift cards b/c that's so impersonal I think.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> We're people too, and they don't always exactly get that.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Flirt and see if he's diggin it
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> A sl*t is any chick that I have sex with.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> so to save you self some missery i wouldnt go but its all up to you.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> And the kid probably wants to be with his mother too.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> cuz ur id is something like seweed69...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> yes it is possible to be in love with more than one person at a time.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> just look like you know where you are going.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> how much money does it have to be?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> the way i get guys is being confident and acting sexy!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> ... baby dont hurt me... baby dont hurt me... no more....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> What if the guy that you don't like starts acting CRAZY?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> You either love him or you don't.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> I hope I'm using it the proper way!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> maybe he's not interested and don't want to hurt your feeling
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> Grow a spine, and quit yer whining.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_30> move on and you will be much happier
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> this is why we spank it so much .
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> it really is closer than you think ;)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> i don't know how long you've been going out with him and i don't know how angry he gets.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Darcy: I see, and so he came here.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> She will never no how much you love her!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> keep in mind where you're going and what the weather is like.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> and personality - what does that mean?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> He is your father even if he did something dumb.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> is that a joke or really  a thing??
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> im great i focuse on passion if theres no passion theres nothing u might as well play chess.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> yes, but not a gurlfriend boyfriend one, just a friend one
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> But if he says Who's Joe?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> If you constantly ask a guestion like that then no is there someone else you want to be w/...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> For some reason, people always want what they think they cannot have.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> Ok so...  Mostly, girls dont' really know what they want.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> If you found these snooping, then you are a very insecure person and not an honest one either.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> UM............ he's a little kid you can't do anything 2 help he can't even get a boner yet
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> Just didn't do anything for me.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> I know u think u are going insane without her.
<NbChars_280> <LevSim_35> the way he acts and treat u
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> this guy in my school is so mean to me like for no reason.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> why not if love is still present then every thing can be solved
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> One year my wife surprised me with a getaway to the Poconos -- it was awesome.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> i couldnt see myself with someone i dont know
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Forget about her and start living life man!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> U DONT so don't try love is a wonderfull grand thing try embracing it not defeating it.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> try balloons, with  i love you on it or something to that affect, and a personal card
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> try flirting with them, and if they want you then they might just ask you out.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> well what do you think u should do.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> You're all wrong except Pete (gr8 name pete!)
<NbChars_260> <LevSim_35> you'll never know until you do!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_10> MY OPINION IS THAT YOU SHOULD TELL US WHAT IT IS THAT YOU WANT OUR OPINION ON ;)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> if he don't want to answer your question, he's not worth it.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> tell them it is only one twon over that is good news
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> well there really isnt a detailed answer for true love ya know?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> after a week or however long it takes for u to get comfortable, u can meet.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> do you even know what your talkin about?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> 11 years and still going strong
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> -Love is to tell her how much I like her, how much I love her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Pretty arrogant, considering they've got the highest divorce rate in the world!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> see how hard he looks for you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> im unable to talk to my friends bout this.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> He is going to want you to do all the things BIG MOMMA does .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> you never really know a guy until you've spent time with them.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> i would say when you hit the age of 45+
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> Why don't you just try new things.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> everyone deserves a second chance but this time around be the boss
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> bite the bullet and just do it
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> I can say that I don't believe in their life style!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> 24/7 to cart his kid around.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Just have fun figuring out what works best for both of you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> sit her down and tell her that you are oLd !!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> you should walk right up to them and ask them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> telling a joke that wasn't funny and u laughed to it.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> there is no way to know.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> I mean look at how you phrased it your ex or a boy you like.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> TELL HIM YOU THINK ABOUT HIM ALOT AND JUST WANTED TO CALL TO SEE IF HES INTERSED
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> he doesn't want you to bother him
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> One is doing all the giving and one is doing all the taking...guess which is which?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> yes my girl is a few years older and it is great
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> Should I be mad or it's really nothing to worry about????
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> ways to relax and enjoy minutes of the day and you?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> I dunno....will you ever ask her to be?
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> only then u'll realize what love is...
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_50> Don't want him to think ur easy.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> to make girls fall in love at first sight
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> it's releving your self of sexual tection.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Thinking with the wrong head lol gets them in trouble everytime.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> kissing her like you mean it and holding her tight
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> is he always in your space or seem to be just as happy walking next to you?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> and its turned out greater than i thought.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> its okay if I must, butI like to check on developments on this subject
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> U deserve to be loved... and loved the right way!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> No I have not... Have you?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> I've liked guys before and wondered if they really do like girls who are hard to get.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> The people I see everyday are not my friends they are just another people...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> It's gross and makes u seem like an animal, but not in a good way.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> sure soudns liek it to me
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> me and this guy are like really good friends.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> get over her or wait till shes availablr
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Guys might not think of it as flirting.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> try new stuff, lean her way every now and then if u catch my drift.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> i really think it depends on contact with the person.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> IMADETELLY SEX WITH WOMEN.IT WILL BE OK.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> Like I said, just think about and do other things that you like/love to do.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> straight up be like hey i really like you...your sweet funny.... thatz the best way in my opinion
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> go for it...live life on the edge hehehe
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> If God didn't want you to be gay, he wouldn't have made you that way.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> I thought it was bad enough that people were going door to door to push religion on others.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> You have got to be kidding?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> What is best for me and mine may not be best for you and yours.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> maybe the lovers love he moon!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> may be your are not pretty at all 'cuz a true crush neva lies :D
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> get off the computer and find yourself a real (willing) human being to do that stuff with.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> No, not for him--for the kids and then treat him special like you haven't in years.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> sorry, but im a boy ^_^
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> let me break this down for you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> i wouldnt do it.sounds like to me he just wants to the money.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> If I am with a girl, I am only with her and nobody else.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> it is much easier to find a girl if ur not looking.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> from the sounds of it, no......y dont you wait and see whar it goes.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> Oh, its good never tried... but any lady want to offer me I will definetly do...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Mostly at home with my girlfriend.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> tell ur mum to choose for u
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if he turns away from you and blushes.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> i don't think marriage is for most people.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> yes if you want to,but is it right?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> sometimes they are totally wrong about their feelings and take wrong decision.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> pick the best one out of the fight
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> at the bootie clubs....you be the judge!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> Others have said just go ahead & do it but there are some things that that won't work for.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> nobody is perfect...... get used to it.....
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Than you probably already know the answer...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> if he ses no gust walk away and avoyed him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Don't worry, his heart will only be broken for around 5 minutes before he finds someone else!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> so he kept on asking and i kept saying no.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Are you with this guy or not?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> The bags can only hold so much!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Breakfast in bed, lunch in bed, dinner in bed.....or tickets to the Super Bowl!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> and notice whats on the inside and how big a girls boobs are doesnt matter if youre in love.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> sometimes praise him and be sure spent as many time as u can with him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Depends...some how you should have sex...at least in your mind!!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> but why go digging in the next persons trash?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Buy her some candy or ice cream.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> she makes me feel great about myself and she likes me too!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> :)))  So, just be straight and tell him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> my 6 year old granddaughter chats with me ever since she could chat.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> try to keep it simple and don't go overboard with skin(you'll want him to respect you).
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> is like you are attacking everyone!!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Don't ever believe you've done something too bad to be forgiven, regardless of what happens.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Think of the movie or novel The Notebook (if you seen it!)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Most of the time the guys that are just messing around are only in it for the ass
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> if he loves you then he will understand.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> oh my goodness, i have this problem as well.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> they like to make girls like them
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> but u've still got nothing dont u?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> After u tell her u can tell if she fell the same way.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> SOMETHING HAD TO BE MISSING FROM YOUR RELATIONSHIP FOR YOU TO SLIP.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> when you cant stop thinking about the guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> if you find me then you can have a hug.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Honestly...he probably just wants to be friends.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> tell him that you might aids and it would be his fault.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> it means 3 some.. go for it ahha
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> i mean u can meet plenty of serial killers at work or at a club.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> Incredible simple - BY TELLING HIM!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> at d same time i still have my dreams and aspirations.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> these days I'm learning new words!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> he trys to hang around u and give u a good look at him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Do you want to spend the rest of you life like this?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> be sure what u r up to.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> You don't have to forwarn him, just do it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> It is called a crush and Lust!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> Not unless u catch him flirting etc.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> there's no way to answer this question.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> young is attractive and even though they are old they still have hormones.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> y does it only have to be pettite girls    large girls can have good looking husbands
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> Then out of no where WHAM!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> are serious at all if u're let me know i will connect u
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> well no is not is yall love dichother is only think it maders
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_10> WHAT IF A CONDOM BREAKS AND YOU GET HER PREGANANT!!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> =] They don't want to seem pushy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> they have it so easy and at the same time can look so damn good!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> dont look at it like that.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> but thats probably a good thing because if not what would we do in our spare time ;)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> He's mad cause you didn't give up no butty?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Darcy: No, that's not what I meant.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> Because European girls are the hottest!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Ya, I think I do... or so people tell me!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> My ex hardly ever wanted to...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Shes a sweetheart and its not the least bit wierd having sex with a girl!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> focus on the good you have.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> i have loved two women at one time.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> go out with each one once and then pick the one you like better.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_25> I am sorry but these are the kind of girls i hate!!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> hell be farting , burping, in the bed and even wanting to sleep seperate from you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Thats sound like a very creative idea...and reading about her it think she will enjoy it... Good luck
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> i have always found my wife sexy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Save yourself those 200 bones and dumb his ass.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> And people think she's dumb--how dumb is she if she has her own business??
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> although, you should tell your boyfriend something.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Can y'all see something I can't??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i'm married, and i havent tried to change my husband.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Not as often as I'd like to!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Astalavista, baby, got me a new lover..
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> when your adult but when the time is right
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> so stop looking and the right guy will come along.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> what you're talking about is not really fighting.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> Don't cheat in the first place!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_10> POEM'S IS NO GOOD FRO BRAKEUPS.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> I am the same way and I do not know why
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> One she has to be a Christian and right with god.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> i would say about 8 th grade about 13 is a good age.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> The boy can dress.My best friend thinks that I should give him a chance.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Give it up and move on with your life.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> because sometimes flirting is just that...flirting.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Just say to her,ILOVE You,then kiss her before she sais nothing...;-)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> men luv gadgets .. get him a latest pocket mp3 player
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> yes if i want i can become a gay.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> or what thats just crazy you need to have a talk with this girl
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> Don't go any further, just let it go.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> you seem like a great girl so just hang in there.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> one day it seems he likes you he send you some signals.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_5> WHEN EVERBODY'S UGLY AND YOU LOST HOPE
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> And dont try to define it, just LIVE IT!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> Barney singing I love you, you love me...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> but it might me interesting if someone get married and then love his wife...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> depends on how long really, and how old you are.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> Tell him that you like you too!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> IT ALL DEPEND ON WHAT GOING ONIN UR RELATIONSHIP TELL US SOME MORE INFO ON UR RELATIONSHIP.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> if I'm constantly asking this question...?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> You obviously do not trust him and a relationship without trust will not go anywhere!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> because alot of girl r on myspace and thay want to keep the girlz on.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Learning grammer & spelling wont hurt!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> i make hime breakfast,lunch and dinner seems to keep him very happy.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> If one didn't work out move on and have some fun.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> It's pretty sad when a 15 yr old puts you in your place...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Find out their phone number,  then add 1-(area code)-(num)-(bers)  g'luck!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> Neither... you know he's cheating, why waste your money?
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_30> well you have to move on.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> so girls, if you want a guy to respect you and take you seriously, don't sell sex.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> because if he flirts with u hes probably just doing it for fun.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Because no real woman will ever just flat out tell a guy she intrested.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> 5.---STOP LISTENING TO ME and tell her the truth.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> If you are a guy it means that one of the girls in the group likes you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Chances are, your teen won't tell you if they are having sex.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> That's basically what i look for.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> Don't dwell on it, for the rest of your life needs living, so try to focus on that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> smiling giggling i would know im a big flirt!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> kiss her neck and ear and whisper words to her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> =D Good luck with your love life!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> ohh and also remember that condom are not 100% always good and you may get her pregnant
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> yes you should but only if he deserves it
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> maybe  maybe not seeing you are a guy unless you mean lets go fishing  then I would love to...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Girls know this and they watch to see if you're nice to the guy she's with.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> wow u must be  small kid... lol its ok just be gay!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> honestly couldnt tell you but if you have to ask things may not be going so well.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Guys always want to have sex
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> even if they think yur boyfriend looks weird, all that matters is that you thinks he looks good!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> A babysitter (if you have kids).
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_20> and if you think she is cute DEFINITELY do not!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> I THINK IF YOU REALLY LOVE SOMEBODY THEN WHEN YOU ARE TEMPTED YOU CHECK YOUR SELF.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> make alot of eye contact and smile when she looks you way.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> everytime i like go up to him he looks all happy and so thats why im not sure.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I hope things work out for ya.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Just have to say - hey!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> take the pic and save in a folder u no.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> No need worrying about the past?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_10> IF BY CHANCE YOUR BOYFRIEND IS A CHRISTIAN THEN FORGIVENESS SHOULD BE EASY .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> marriage and relationships are not supposed to be like that.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> im in one right now, and will be for another 5 months.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if you cheated on him then why do you want him back.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> he probably thinks you like it and it makes him better in your eyes.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> you do not deserve this and realy neither does he.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> u have to do everything from ur heart be true to her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> i hope my rambling on has helped some.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> wait till marriage for sex, hun.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> to take their bad and their good all the time.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> will telling him now make him move away?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> and yeah is slang for yes.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_15> SOUNDS LIKE YOU NEED TO GET AWAY FROM HIM.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> i don't think that there is someone better looking.
<NbChars_280> <LevSim_15> 36 B .TO A 36 C .
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> I find it hillarious when a guy TRIES to look sexy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> I also love a girl what can I tell you?
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_25> Go get an STD test you ho.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> No but why wouldn't you just buy the cheaper one that looks exactly the same?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> And are you sure that she is?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> now we see them in the shower at the gym.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> You only get one chance at doing this thing called life.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> I don't know what to do..
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> we all know when a woman is interested in us... ;)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> yea,sometimes they look for a girl with breast  or a big butt...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> let me reitterate this one: NO.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> probably 15 cos shes gonna be a little mature but is still very sweet
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> if you two are serior i say 3 months ...if not that serious.. you decide
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_15> HE NEEDS TO GET INTO A REHAB AND GET CLEAN.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> I know you are a smart girl.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> If he does...he isnt worth it
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Hey man... girls are those interesting animal different (very differents) from men.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_30> why'd u ask if ur gonna be skeptical?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> Now, don't you go messing with trouble.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> If she wants to just cuddle... then just cuddle... don't get all pushy and horny on her.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> Remember that you care about someone.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> That's like asking, Do u like black ppl?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> Take you a little feel too.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> because they a losers and nothing better to do with but hurt girls.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> ive done it be for and im finally with the love of my life.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> but until then i might as well becasue i ain't really doin it so.....
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> just try to be a sweet girl and ignore him some times.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> :P  I really can't explain it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> keep trying new things and if thatn doesnt work ask her her wuts up?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> is he too old 4 u?
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_25> EDIT: Here's sort of a nasty trick you can do.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> Be your most charming self and be sure you give her sexy eyes, and if she flirts, flirt back.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> Day and night, why only one?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Look at your question list, dolon, you're pathetic...
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> sex does get monotonous at times, but we try to find things to liven it up a little.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> If you cheated on him then I don't blame him for being mad.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_45> find out if he likes u, ad if he does than ask him out
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> Just tell her, you are 21 and your own person.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> do you think i might be making her nervous?
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_30> i knew it when my heart and brain went numb
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_25> It's not going to get any better
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> Trust me, that ought to make him happy!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> OH GOD yeah....umm, you can exceed the norm for how kinky you guys are used to getting.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_60> sex is a beautiful thing embrace it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> When I see a girl all slutty, what else would a guy think about.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> maybe because love isn't what we expect it to be.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> She is crazy if she doesnt love it!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> Because of recent happenings in my life, I find myself single and alone again at age 51.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Uh...you are to young for me!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> what trust does she have with this other friend that keeps you from i guess dating her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> 1st ask yourself, why did he leave?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Divorce him and get on with the rest of your life.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> yeah my boyfriends do a lot.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> no sense crying over spilt milk later on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> my crush has odd taste in shoes, but i still like him a lot.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> maybe find someone new to ask out
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> so i sent him and e-card saying mommy, this monkey follwed me home.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> w/ guys or he tells u.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> guys dont like to be crowded
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> he is on his best behaviour
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> the craziest song was chicken head um that was the only loud thing we had
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> See you are what i call... a bad guy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> if you cant talk to him now how will things be in the future?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> First you have to be completely sure your doing the right thing for yourself!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> please insert a real photo since you're a real person
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> down there if you get my drift.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> IT HELPS RELEIVE THE PRESSURE ON YOUR TUMMY.AND IT'S A WONDERFUL POSITION FOR HITTING THE WOMENS TWO G SPOTS.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> There really is no way to tell if a person is being honest with you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> just talk to him make him laugh alot,thats the best way to flirt.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> now were just friends, but i still like hima nd i think he likes me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> BUT IF YOU ARE NOT GOING OUT WITH A GIRL IT IS OK.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> i like to do sex after lunch and after dinner .
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> this means that he really wants to be around the one that he cares about.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> she was not looking for nothing at school,and there he was!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> tend  her to talk to u.
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_20> 16 and 21 is a big difference.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_35> Forget her and start hunting for a better gurl
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> What girl could say no to that?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> because you're a jackass trying to sound like a gansta.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO KNOW THAT?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> God bless and hang in there.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> or check to see if he wears a wedding ring.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> eHarmany.com I heard was really good my best friends mom met her fiance` there
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> IF YOU REALLY CARE FOR SOMEONE,IT IS THE WHOLE PERSON YOU CARE ABOUT, NOT JUST WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> he is in his mid 40's.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> think on that for a while.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> me and my fiance are freaking out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> No even if you and her be friends for thirty years.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> You go girl :o) Hopefully I find a nice guy someday.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> a good cry, a good drink, and a good friend.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> don't do it...its not worth it !!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> did you ever think that she wriggles out of it because she doesn't want to go out with you?
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_25> i mean would you take a mexican guy over someone else?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> Thats the way I see it
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> I see its all about his child, but him going around you to his EX.GIRLFRIEND!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> i used to have a bf and we broke up.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> i need someone to go out with
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> I get the feeling like wow, where did that come from?!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> just because you cheated on him doesn't mean he has to get mad at you,does he?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> It gets you no where, it drives her away.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> say you are being a little too clingy
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> romantic guys aren't always the best!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> Interesting....  And I'd have no problem watching brokeback mountain, just not with my dad.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> U just tell the grrrs, It's small, but it's cute ;-)
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_60> How often do you ... you know?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> (not a phisical fire... dont burn down your house)
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> beg her to forgive you and understand her if she didn't
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Let him marinate with someone else cuz obviously you cant produce.......No disrespect
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> can i learn to get past that and trust a woman again?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> Guys are forgetful too, you know?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> I definatly don't want one in my neighborhood...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Hey this is just a womans perseptive.
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_30> shes a f**cking lunatic and controling and whiny.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> he doesnt deserve the money, afterall you have been buying all the baby stuff right?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Stick to the girls who like baseball & beer, they are the best ones!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> hey 2 points is 2 points
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> but if you want more, don't be afraid to ask his status.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> he looks exactly like my cousin though so its kinda wierd!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> from experience i can say.... because of the relationship with the childrens mother!
<NbChars_275> <LevSim_35> Two years is too long to wait!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> When you always do what the SHE/HE likes.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> please tell me what !what is love
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> Would be real great to meet and make friends with a gay guy.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> Have fun and if you wear lingerie for him, he'll NEVER leave you!!!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> Honey, just because you are in love doesnt mean you should try anything he wants to try.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> Why would you want him if he doesn't want you?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> He makes a total fool of himself around you...
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> don't worry your not alone...i just don't feel to have a commitment right now...im so busy to my studies...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Don;t be surprized is they do not confide much once she starts counciling.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> is he full of crap and scared to admit his real feelings or am i just tripping?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> TELL HIM THAT YOU DONT HAVE THE SAME FEELING AS B4 JUST TELL HIM THE TRUTH
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Don't wait until things get worse.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> I say Chicken .. or rooster for that matter!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i just want her to be happy.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> you really are no good to yourself, your kids & your wife if you stay.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> She's your wife you should b w/ her.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> Unless the girl is really enjoying it then time will not be a factor...
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_50> not something to fall in and out of so fast.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> It's like me trying to be a lesbian when I like men so much:)).
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> If your man is doing this for you, he is into you....
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> I personally don't like it very much.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> They want someone who is smart and funny and...!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> when true love is involved then color is not an issue
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> And no matter how much I fought that fact, that was definately the case for me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> if that is ur name, sure.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> When you always think about someone.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> for some people marriage is a mistake.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> He just knows you like him and you are an easy target.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> their personality, and if they flirt with me while siting on my lap when stealing kisses with me.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> no not if u feel like it was the right thing to do

<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> So if you don't love her, be honest with her!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> I never kiss a boy before.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> yes and i waz so dumb 4 that 1
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> sometimes alone time is the best way to know yourself ( what u need and want).
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> you are getting sloppy seconds and the other womens problems that he did not tell you about.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> But, life goes on and you  have to MOVE on.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> it sounds like you are just f@#king... if you arent dating then i recoment to stop having sex.

<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> you'll find some one that likes you for you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> But not enough to give up the attention she gets from keeping guys like you around.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> i dunno, it's nice not worrying about bills and rent, but it's also kinda getting old.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> hold your breath and lick there ass....seriously
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> But like i said not all young women date young men they do like the more mature ones
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> no matter how long i would wait.

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> he is hot,funny,and smart.he is just my kind of guy one problem,he's sorta a player.wat should i do?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> well my first kiss was last year.so yeah 15 years old.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> you can't make someone love you
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> some people are just scared of the d word....  DIVORCE!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> talking to people on the internet is like talking to a mystery peron.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Good Luck Hope I helped a bit
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> i was with my ex for four years.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Like the guy decides to get hooked up.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> I have felt like that a lot in my life...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> If ya'll can work it out then no.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> I don't know, that girl sounds like a flake.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> I don't want a simple answer...like it tastes salty...explain that to me.thats a homework question ppl
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> So just roll w/ the punches and just dont call back and get a new girl.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Oh - and my husband and I will be praying for you and your marriage and your children!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> hug him with his waist ,put your lips on his lips /cheek.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> And, by the way ... BEAUTIFUL IS ABSOLUTELY WRONG!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> You were blind like most men because us women expect you guys to read our minds.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Do it only when u r in good mood.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> A good lover will want to please you first..no matter what.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> just follow along with what he's doing and you'll just be fine....
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> Maybe he's gay think about it carefully.... lol c'mon on the butt?
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> Thanks  (Our house is up for sale now)
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> to get her back just apologize to her say some phrases or give her some flowers
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_40> Do what you did in the past.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_70> so never think of another man or women in your life.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> I wouldn't care if my boyfriend (If I had one) bought another girl a drink.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> aside from the fact that they could be called queen mother.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> YOU HAVE GAVE HIM CHANCHES BEFORE, GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> do it once in a while.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I don't ever do anything about it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> it depends on the mistake, pray about what you have done.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Unless the both of you are divorced, I don't see the two of you hookin up.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> well if u want 2 have a girlfriend, why would u ask in da internet.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> i like girls that are fun,active,and doesent smoke.

<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> Well, you ask me, but the answer is NO!!!!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> Yah.. sometimes i think blue because I'm very sad Don't worry, you're normal!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Keep me in the loop of things and let me know how it goes, good luck and have fun!!!!

<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> Maybe you'll be lucky and she'll want you!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Most people, sadly, don't realise the difference between sex (the act) and love making.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Move on and you should not have moved in with him...  keep telling ladies this... don't believe me.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_30> spandex n a muscle shirt lmao
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> You give me hope for the future...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> def pretty face and ok body
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> I am dating a guy that is 25 and I am 28!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> girlslike to talk a lot abou them selves.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> this wnt help u at all
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> My advice would be.... 1. go to counciling on your own.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> perhaps they really are virgins, or they just dont want to get a bad reputation.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> Thats if you lived here in NC.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> try getting kermit if u don't think it's to dumb.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> see u gotta tell her some time or the other.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> sure, may not be healthy but *hit happens
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> fantasizing in an inapropriate place, say, um, church, for instance....nasty.
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_25> I know a few 'gay people'.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> if you really love her you won't.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> yes love hurts i do not care how in love you are it just really hurts .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> She likes me as a friend but not as a boyfriend.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Go slow...if a guy or girl is worth it, they will not rush you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> since i started the longest i've gone since then was about two months
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> but i don't know if i should make my move or what.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> A good reason to wait until marriage!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Unless you like being in bondage...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> I think the girl above named Cindy is so right on target...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Not every girl give out their #
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> and i thanked him for helpin me sort out another bad seed.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> totaly,loves her is more like it
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> No 'cuz I'm a straight guy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> find one you're interested in and ask her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> No offense... but are you drunk.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> If he smiles and looks at u.  he might try to start a conversation
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Have you done anything to make her mad?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> (due to a severe car accident, semi-truck hit me head on!!)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I get hints that he tries but he never does.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Don't flirt with everyone, or else they will think you are a whore.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> ..because life moves on and you can't dwell on the past.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> what did you do to lose her?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_10> FOR EVERY WOMAN IS A MAN
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> But a young person (under 18) should not be kissing anyone!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> But I would think sucking a cock is nasty!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> It is definetly ok to want to be pleased.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> get rid of the guy, there's no true love there
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Hot guys are out there but without intelligence and a strong mind they mean nothing!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> and valentines day is coming up and i want to give him something.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> i don't think nationalities should be in question here.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> not good eventually it doesn't work out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Generally, guys do not find it attractive when a girl asks them out.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> tell them the truth, be out right and forward about it so theres no cunfusion, this sounds pretty serious.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Micheal Jakson doesnt sleep dont you know that?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> I never give out my number at bars, if they ask, i always give them a fake one.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> if you r then its perfectly natural if your not then i suggest seeing a doc.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> home is good but dont you want great?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> i do everything for my bf and i get nothing in return
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Was I supposed to just get over her?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> It didn't work so great back then either.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> As long as u love them and they love u then i dont see why not!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Can I buy you a fish sandwich?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> u have to ask urself...  is he worth it?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> Because you gave them to her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> What is it men think s hottest?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> I can't seem to let her go...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> (Assuming you dont really KNOW the guy)
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> Well even good women get hurt by men too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Hi how are you I guess nobody is online cuz theres so many questions without answers.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> don't worry about those kind of guys, just be yourself and you will find mr.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> dont leave him out of your life.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> U have to try practically.....asking out here in Answers will not help.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Ya need to Change things, don't accept what you have now.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> not that im asking her to marry me.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> I heard it is even sexy!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> hmmm.... do a lot of housework!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> sure..if you don't mind the military lifestyle
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> That weak little man that thinks he needs to hit you to feel like a man needs to GO!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Be real and tell her whats happenig...Don't lie because the things may get more complicated!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Now he is going out with aother guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> you must be bad in spelling or you must be so high
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> I wanna marry, not just date.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> you already know the answer to this question.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> but I do have a old truck for work!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> So at school I flipped him off but didn't get in trouble.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> well thats easy if he doesnt love you just break up with him.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> CONGRAT ON YOUR NEW FOUND LOVE!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Either way, it doesn't really mean she's interested in you so what does it matter?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> If you're up for the adventure!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> So at school I flipped him off but didn't get in trouble.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> well thats easy if he doesnt love you just break up with him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> CONGRAT ON YOUR NEW FOUND LOVE!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> Either way, it doesn't really mean she's interested in you so what does it matter?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If you're up for the adventure!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> God fearing men is the best guy!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> MY THING IS,  WHY STOOP TO THEIR LEVEL AND GAMBLE WITH YOUR MANHOOD/WOMANHOOD BY CHEATING TOO?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> he got me a plush doggy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> When she gets older would you want her to stay with someone who treats her like that?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> he didnt say anything after that.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> if you are a man love on your wife there is nothing that beats that.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> will you play doll house with your kid?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> It was the way to go, no stress at all!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> So why can't i get a date????
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> Is not working out once mean I should just move on?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> she says that she do that because she talks to other ppl online .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> buy a dozen white roses, then put a single red rose in the middle.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> And it didn't cost me a dime, just a little of my time.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> wow id have to say.... around....17 or so?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Anyone who cheats on you is not worth it baby or no baby.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> the cute thing is that i only got him something and he only got something for me.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> then just ask her to go out with you.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> Yeah thats fine but it does mean something.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> be kind to your self you have to live with you no one else love your self.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> IF that doesn't work...maybe you should break it off.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> i like her and she does me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> so is that cheating or not.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if he wants to divorce his wife anyway...i think you should tell her what he said to you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_5> BECAUSE BOYFRIENDS COME AND GO FRIENDS ARE FOREVER !!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> Cause y'all ask for it;Don;t ask like u don't want our # anyway.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> DAMN, no wonder I've been cranky.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> Hot bodt with an ok face.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> But just make sure you do it in person... over the phone or online are NOT as special.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> A BACK STABING BAD FRIEND= WITH FRIENDS LIKE THIS WHO NEEDS ENEMYS.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> A WOMEN SHOULD BE TREATED WITH RESPECT, LOVE ,TENDERNESS .
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> every one does at one point.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> even if you're shy, you can still ask her out calmy and joyfully.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> i am studying it at skool damn somebody done gave u a std.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> If you have had sex, you are not a virgin... ...if you haven't,  then you are.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> I still love her after everything i have been threw with her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> if you rilly love them then your never to old.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE,IT WAS NOT MENT TO BE.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> younger boys are immature, just to let you know.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> no , letter are great they express love better anything
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> you just have to go talk to her, i know how hard it is beleive me
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Hell yea ur a lil too old.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Umm..its depends if you both really like eachother then YES all the way!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> My grlfriend caught me talking 2 my ex ?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> You pick guys like this for a reason.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_40> Not everyone is like your wife.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> You just have to know that he's got your back no matter what!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> even though we haven't met face to face were both in love.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> as long as you want to..........there is no set time.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> but she is soo great to talk to and I don't want to hurt her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> We talked about it and I got SO excited.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> THAT COULD BE JUST WHAT SHE'S LOOKING FOR.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> Why don't you just ask her!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> Dumped the guy, dumped the best friend & I haven't gotten that close to another woman since!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> No, definitely color has nothing to do w/ great marriage.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> it shows she is comfortable with you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> You have sex with her while she's sleeping??
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> A team or a club or a gym...?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> because its in our mind....other than that its like a jog in the park.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_35> it seems u r hot !
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Do what you want, just stay away from my man would ya!?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> 1 the fact that he has a car is a pretty good start
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> I would think I was like a hero
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> 1 n 3 open her clothes and then have sex with her
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> But maybe because I have black hair also.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> in most cases, once a cheater always a cheater,  think, before you jump again...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> don't be mean,and don't do crazy things!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> it depends the person u want to love, if he is a friend then don't mix it with love.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> when u r ready to continue ur life   dont rush urself but do not wait forever either
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> hey boo, let me keep it real if she loved you then she would show it all the time.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> An emotionally broken man finds it impossible to come up...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> of course confident.. no need to explain.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> just be cool and dont try to act like you got game.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> do what you know is right.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> i love you doesnt count during two occasions.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> be your self a oman like men that arent a fake my friend.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> :)  (PS - We've been dating for going on two years now, so it worked for me!)
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_25> tell your guy to GET A LIFE!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> ISN'T THAT THE KIND OF WOMAN YOU WOULD LIKE TO HAVE?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> Go to England and ask one out?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Either way you should get this checked out.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_60> fat or thin, it's what's in the heart that counts
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> give her clues to how u feel and if that doesnt work than u should just tell her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> to love is loveless unless u love yourself.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Can't do much more than you already have.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Cool down .....he would be just like any other guy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> also u don't want to rush back in with bagage from the last guy( u know?)
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> hey you can't wrong with the date sampler of dinner and movie.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> in other words,if it works for ya'll,then ROCK ON!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> Ask him out the same way you'd ask a black guy out.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> michigan is the sexiest state in the us.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Im feeling like that right now with my  girl friend.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> If i liked someone i dont think it would matter.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> If he broke up w/me-I'd keep it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> what's in it for him, will you sign a pre nup ?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> if your too nice people will pick up on thet and abuse it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> they will now be on time
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> even more if the girl is goodlooking.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Don't do it men lie a lot.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> stand behind her and play with her hair, girls like that!
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> #1. if he accuses you of cheating, u know hes messing around
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> Yeah why not... just don't get too wild.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> what stailive missed is that its not beholder it's beerholder
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> are the symtoms of falling out of love.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_30> And DONT talk to you ex if you arent over him yet!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> Ask him if he really loves you and why hes hittin' on other girls?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> Ask him what he wants and give it to him.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> Y would 3 b so bad?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> It's just something you feel together, hey!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Why stay in love with the one that does not care about you or love you in return?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> girl you should break up wit him because he proalbly has girl on the side
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> most girls cant stand cheesy unless its creative and cute.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> he is the sweetest chachito EVER!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> but thats nothing todo with you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> girls like a guy who will admit he goofed up and apologize.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> i CAN TELL YOU STORIES WITH HAPPY ENDINGS AND STORIES WITH SAD ENDINGS.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> PICK A QUIET PLESANT PLACE,WERE YOU WON'T BE DISTURBED.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> Why is it that when I finally find love there has to be somthing in the way?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> If she really loved you she wouldn't ask.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> i think about him all the time.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> love ya lots like tater tots!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> any day  for sure not problems
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> nah, it's got nothing to do with pride.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> i have so many love names for him like : corazon, amor, taquito, chiquito, bebe, papi, etc.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> be a friend unless you have romantic interest in him
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> stop sucking dick and start eating pussy
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> If he cannot play it straight, then he is not very honest is he?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> THAT WAS AN EXAGERATION BUT ALOT OF TIMES.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> :) and in teams there is no room for selfishness.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Girl don't let him control you!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Unless you have kids and she isn't ready for that yet.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Stay strong, you can make it!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Well for me it does not exist...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> i really do love her ..
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> it's only gentlemen like to do so.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> then, depending on his answer, dump him or don't
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> THEY LOVE YOU.. THATS WHY YOU LIVING WITH THEM OKAY THATS SHOWS TRUE LOVE....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> make sure she is not racist
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> when i was at ft benn.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> If you can affort it try jewery (necklace)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Then you go out and cheat on him?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> if your his gf then tell him that he is clumpsy in terms of sweetness and caring!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> I can't tell you but it lasts forever Oh!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> I think its normal, most guys think about sex alot too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> My friend asked me this and I told her to dump him.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> If you aint gettin it somebody is
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Tell your girl that you need girl time with her without guys around.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> how can i know his nature & how can i know dat if he really loves me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT SHE IS 3 OR 2 YEARS OLDER THAN ME.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> depends r u on your period?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> most women don't have a high sex drive until there 35 or older.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> Just say to yourself outloud in a crowd of single men......NEXT!!!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> when that's broken it takes much time to heal.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> whta is this world coming to ?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> There are some women that I can't imagine with anything but long hair...and it looks delicious!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> no i would not resent the person being late.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> Well for me its outta there, whoo livin on me own!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> just b urself if he doesn't want u then forget about him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> (I have a recipe for spicey meatloaf if ya want it)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> Remember, guys really don't like girls who are easy, they just use you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Spend your money on a therapist, okay?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Unless you're married and have kids, etc...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> like do u think she will be willing 2?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> BE NICE< BE THE CLASS CLOWN AND JUST BE FRIENDLY!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> if that fails, just ask him out (go w/ something simple like would you accompany me to...(a funeral maybe?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> BUT YOU MUST REMEMBER TO RESPECT THE SPACE THAT SHE IS ASKING YOU FOR.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> i think its bad ,because i have had one .
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> nope i think black&pink because blue is so old already almost everybody likes blue!!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> If you feel theres no hope what so ever then fuck it.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> He only does it now at my BEGGING maybe once every 2 wks
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> like every one will tell you... if you are not ready for it dont do it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> I would... and I did...  been married for 3 years now.....
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_10> AND THEY MUST LOVE EACH OTHER TOO!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> dont be shakin in your boots.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> but I don't think I think in blue
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> IF UR IN SCHOOL, I SAY, IF U CAN LIVE FREE.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Maybe go to the beach, or something fun like, I don't know, miniture golf.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> but befor u do that, see why he is saying that.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> change ur pace every once in a while.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> i think there is no true defnition of love except this one love is love
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> my girl friend was..Hurts like hell.That's why i never trusted best friend anymore
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> He's still youre dad and he loves you no matter what.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> i like the way a person carries themselfs
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> over and over if you had too, love is worth it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Why don't you just tell them you are saving for a house?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> I dont like bars or dance clubs that much.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> it's not good to hate but it depends on wat he did?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> then make it a goal to say something, even if its only hi, every day.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> tell them to go somewhere and then burn your house
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Otherwise, I found myself hanging out with the guys wasting time.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> maybe you mean to, maybe you don't.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> I mean... Is that his best physical feature?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> also ask for her number and email.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> Ask her what is the deal between yall.if she says gust friends then leave it is.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> but if it was just a friend dance then its ok.

<NbChars_185> <LevSim_25> please don't stop reading because of that comment.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> ok, well you could either wait for him to move back up  where you live.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> so roll the dice and ask him instead of us.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_35> !or just have a friend tell him.

<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> Whatever u and your mate compose.

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Why don't you talk to her about it???
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> no, there is nothing herbal you can do to make it bigger,nature gave you all you will ever have.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> how long have u being go out wit her?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> platy games with my ex wifes husband, the one that wouldnt think about fooling around onn her
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> but dont cheat cuz that will hurt her even more.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> i prefer older men myself  more mature and usually dont play as many games as the young guys
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if you both like each other and want to make it work it can happen.

<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> dont just say random things that spout outta your head.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> because you don't know why the ladies don't like you, so you can't fix the problem.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> we are both in our 40's
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> The one that makes you both orgasm the hardest.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> I LOVE THE FLAVA FLAVE SHOW.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> You are a little bit too young to be kissing or doing anything else!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> i dont think you men realize what mental abuse is or know that you are even doing it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> I am a guy and I work from home.

<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> ID SAY AFTER HIGH SCHOOL I MOVED OUT WHEN I WAS 16 IM 21 NOW
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> I did not care about what others in school was doing
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> and try to amend your ways i mean your weakness you know yourself.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> after all they are the ones who give birth.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> I know it sucks, but guys need to make the first move.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> and ohh give her white roses on valentines day, they are really romantic!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> She may say how am I?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Take care and you will definately be in my thoughts!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Did he try to get back with you during that 5 months?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> like the best to contact her...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> what things can you say or the places you can go
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Dating for fun is just stupid.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> I am pretty sure he doesn't have a gf ....
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> Depends on which f-word you mean...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> it will mess up your new relationship and u will be right back to the begining.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> should i even make a move on him or not???
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> no, not at all - let him know how you feel
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> it happend to me and... here i am - married 4-1/2 years.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> If all else fails... chocolate is always a good backup (with strawberries is possible)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> yes, my cousin is gay, and she's honestly one of my best friends ever!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> ...and can we using masks ..even for good goal?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> then have at it...  you'll be pleasantly suprised.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> it's really about the way of thinking & not age...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> I felt the same way she did.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> ( he is gone two weeks at a time.)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> However DO NOT TESTIFY ON EITHER OF THEIR BEHALFS.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> then have at it...  you'll be pleasantly suprised.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> it's really about the way of thinking & not age...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> I felt the same way she did.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> ( he is gone two weeks at a time.)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> However DO NOT TESTIFY ON EITHER OF THEIR BEHALFS.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> I never liked him i liked his friend.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Be yourself and if that ain't impressive enough then the man has issues!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> give as much response,dont know what to do
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> And I don't use cheesy pick-up lines!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> bEST WAY FOR YOU IS TO MEET WITH HIM IN PUBLIC DONT BE ALONE WITH HIM.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> THEY DON'T LAST LONG AFTER YOU LET THEM BACK HOME.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> maybe he knows and just doesn't find you attractive so he/they sidestep the issue.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_25> So you have a lot of options...
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_35> Don't give up snowboarding for a guy.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Well, since your shy, and she's shy, go to her tommorrow.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Either he just can't hang or your putting to much enfasis on sex and love.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> if she's okay with it, then NO.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I did it once with my girlfriend and it was awesome!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> I'll go for the pig answer here....Breasts, legs, and butt....bigger the better on all 3
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> Ask him what he wants - then give it to him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Of COURSE it would be a big mistake!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_5> YOU CAN ALWAYS BRING THE MEMORY OF YOUR OLD FRIEND INTO YOUR NEW RELATIONSHIPS...GOOD LUCK
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> be straight with her, that is what most girls look for in a guy at least i do.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> I've answered at least one of this guy's questions not that i'm jealous or anything-puhlease!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I found mine on the internet.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> he is also either playing or really self centred and rude!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Don't worry you will find the right guy.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Its called family you'll know whenits time to move on.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> enjoy time with your family while you can :).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> please tell me what to do..
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> i would 1st cuss her out.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_5> LOOK IT UP IN THE DICTIONARY IF YOU ARE SO WORRIED ABOUT KNOWING WHAT LOVE IS!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> i definetly would if i was horny.why not?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> could have just been pillow talk too, dont make a biggie out of it .
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> but remember to be nice to the girls
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Think about boogers, toe fungus, my mother-in-law.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> some guys not but others i think are hot
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> no it just means hes cocky and wants to play games be carefull that way you dont get hurt.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> your probably holding your lighter too close to it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Also guys dig chicks who like games.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> You know, don't mind about it that much.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Don't let your wife off the hook!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> WRITE HIM A NOTE, ASK THE QUESTION ,DO YOU LIKE ME WRITE CIRCLE YES OR NO
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> If the guy you are with cares about you a lot and loves you- STICK WITH HIM.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> um.. it depends do they both no you love them and someone else?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> maybe you guys have some suggestions for me...
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> you ask them to marry you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> IF U DO I  AM SOO INTERESTED IN TALKING TO U CUZ HE IS THE HOTTEST PERSON ALIVE
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> and for christmas he came down to az to visit and gave me a diamond ring.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_55> or he may just come out and tell you.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> If he liked your friend he would go out with her.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Because people don't always marry the right person.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Why don't young men like older women?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> mine stays in the house :)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> When that happened to me I went straight to my friend.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> he seems like a nice guy stick with him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> but if they kick u out hen sorry they still love you though!!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> way of wearing rings or something like that.....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> No i think in purple, its more loveable and happy not so...depressed
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> victorias secret if not long.......and if money is no object-take her on a weekend get-away!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> i think i know what ur getting at.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> Hell ya girlfriend be up front and honest.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> its not tough- it just does not go the way we want it to go- big difference!!.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> I dont date anyone younger than 17.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> just whatever you do, make sure he doesn't cheat on you!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> SO WHAT CAN I DO ?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> No; cause if I flirt then you better believe that he was flirting with me first.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> if a guy isnt ready to say he loves you there is nothing wrong with that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Then she came back to me sayin that she didn't want that guy anyway.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> but there`s a lot of confusions as we`ve never seen each other...only n photos & n web cam.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> hey if you really love him explain to him that being mean to your friends is not right.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> he is always up looking at the boys on their pijames
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> he's being chinsy and in the process being dishonest and very much not a man at all!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> We have big arms, sexy bodies...jajaja.....yeah right!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> no u can't date while ur getting a divorce that would be cheating and its still wrong
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> thatnx for the anser on the one aboutthe guy thats older than me!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> pissed cuz she's telling me she aint worried about me trying to get in her panties
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> tight boxers is a lot sexier!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> if you love them more then that has to be the answer right there
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> that is such a COOL idea!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> my neck, lower back and thighs.. hehehe
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> I suggest you just move on...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> but i wouldnt want to have to wait
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> when it comes to emotions guys just dont show it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> and get your way with the real person.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> mabe it was him an had no other way of tellin u that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> it thkes trust on both sides.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> HAND UP POSTERS OF THAT ERA IN YOUR RECEPTION AREA.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> Its not all on the girl, tho.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> maybe best to just give it some more time and see if he shows up
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> Well I tried to give advice...=D lol.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> And maybe they will be good friends
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> cheat on him..duh .have sex with his best friend
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> write her a letter if ya dont feel comfortable.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> he is so o.m.g darn adorable!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> look her straight in the eyes and and have a kind look on your face.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> i'm so glad u asked this question
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> what celebrity would you like to sleep with??
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> Therefore, we like sex a lot!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Good luck and I hope it works out for you!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> for me you should teel the truth
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> it took me a whole year to admit to my friend cherry and myself that i felt for him.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> you just ended up with a wrong guy.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> when I liked a guy I sent him a valentines day card.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> Well your lucky dont sweat it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> it depend on the girl's nature
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> it's not what u get, it's what u give that really counts.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Girls like that only want one thing: Money.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> Like asking if they need help.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> yes.when ur having sex ur inside someone and it feels as if u two were one.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Treat them like they are the most special woman that u ever met.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> But dont listen to all of dragonfire.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> and before i let you go let me leave you with this.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_30> or how far would u go with a guy?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> it'll be hard but u have to get over it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> now i am confused and dont know what to do!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> the answer to your question doesn't lie in me or anyone else you ask.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Is he just fronting, does he really care, should I just leave it alone?!?!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> do you look at her differently does it make her less classy than you originally thought?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> Which is scarry coz I think he's almost 9!!!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Why don't they move to be with you??
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> i don't know did u ?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Why on earth would you buy an ENGAGEMENT ring for an EX girlfriend???
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> That is when you are a legal adult
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> a good marriage counseler can help.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_30> If you're making out heavily at 13 have fun with a baby at 16!!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> Why can't someone be just mine?

<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> And he is everything I have ever dreamed of!

<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> my gosh,i hope you realize what a great guy you have and don't cheat on him!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> If you love that person, then, yes.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> When you feel it coming on, slow down and think about something off subject.. like drag racing..LOL
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> or they must using mask to have what they need & want ?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> mmmmm.... looks at me and smile and look down.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> YOU SHOULD REALLY TALK TO HIM OR MAYBE HE IS NOT READY FOR THAT KIND OF A COMMITMENT.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> watch dvds with him alone and by the way i am18
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> stick your tongue in their dookie shoot
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> if they're such a good friend, why r they tryna get wit your man in the first place?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> By nature, they are the ones that guys want.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> we have been together for 3 yrs.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> didn't get to know eachother before hand.

<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> try sexing without  1. thinking bout it 2. listening to it 3. thinking bout it.

<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> so what should i do ???
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> If you did not have sex, well then your are still a virgin.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> or are they just seeing people?

<NbChars_85> <LevSim_10> YEA IF YOU DIDNT HAVE VAGINAL INTERCOUSE THEN U ARE
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> Most boys my age don't even look twice at me.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Baby girl if you are under 15 you should consider your education and goals before a hot guy!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> its probably already happening, you just don know it
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> um ya this is deep so id say them or u ur self & i
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> well it depends what the truth is.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> well maybe a little but it takes time that is the point i'am making.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Just means he wants himself more than you want him!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> maybe set up the bar like the old speakeasies
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Ask yourself these questions: Am I happy?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> yeah i was and the guy broke up with me because he said he doesn't like long relationships.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> Your optional answers only leave me to believe she's a blow up doll, so...   3. have sex with it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> when we are happy we forget everything.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> you have to ask him and let him know you like him!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> if all else fails you can always talk about it.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> maybe because of your president behaviour toward the world ....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Girls love REAL not phoney stuff.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> If you aren't helping him, then you are a part of his (and your) problem.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> It SO depends on the girl!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> 2 of them already have a family.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> Oh and remember, BE A GENTLEMAN!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> if the boy or girl is flirting with you constily giving you hugs andgiving or send you love notes
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> Talk bout stuff she can get into.
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_30> if you have bumped uglies, then you are not
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> I guess you should make your selfesteem stronger... HOW?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> a friend of mine he was my blockmate for one subj.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> give your bf time, just because you say it doesnt mean he has to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> They had a really great marriage and he loved her dearly.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> My son asks, why can't my dad be like Bob my husband.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> (though my family seems to go senile at age 8 but still) see what I mean?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> I guess she really wasn't my best friend was she.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> thats going to be hard...have you talked to your best friend about this?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> If that doesn't work, smash his computer to bits!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> nah i really think in tikny colours haha
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> I usually say Hey there sweet thang.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> Remember BOYS DONT WRITE LETTERS, THEY PROPOSE.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> When guys wear boxers, they look like little boys.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> sometimes i think that some men look for a woman to treat them bad.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> But if they are 40 and 43 then ok.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> ya i have the same prob.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> ALWAYS KNOW THAT A WOMAN NEEDS TO FEEL AS IF YOU HEAR HER.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> When guys wear boxers, they look like little boys.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> sometimes i think that some men look for a woman to treat them bad.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_30> But if they are 40 and 43 then ok.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> ya i have the same prob.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> ALWAYS KNOW THAT A WOMAN NEEDS TO FEEL AS IF YOU HEAR HER.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> U should buy something very special tht she doesn't have.
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_25> Dont sleep with someone like that!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> Yea.. i'm myself when I am around her but I want her to see me different, have any ideas?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> it will happen when you least expect it to  :)
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> It's all or nothing with me!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> And for gods sakes, buy a guy a drink every once in a while.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> i think most boys find the internal beauty of a girl at first you know what i mean
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> stay with him if he is the one you want go for him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i have to say my wife will never get out of the nurseing home.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> A guy is either great, or a jerk.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> if they will leave the relationship because you express yourslef then it's not worth it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> and if he did it once he has enough power over me to do it again.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> go out there n look 4 some1 special.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> DO NOT DIP YOUR PEN IN THE COMPANY INK!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> I AM GOING TO CHOOSE DAM&DUF BLIND WOMAN
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> my youngest brother is 9 years younger then me.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> WHY NOT GO TO YOUR LOCAL SCHOOL AND GET THE BAND TO PERFORM SOME SONGS?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> I have a special little unicorn my husband just loves.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> he proposed me & i agreed.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> because all you will do is eventually spout hate.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> What can I say I'm just blessed?!?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> But we became friends anyhow and that was it..
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> and i love nature......butterflies, flowers, trees all that stuff
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> time flies when your on yahoo answers
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> It sounds like counseling may help you two, alot.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Then ask a girl to have sex with you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> On a bed, in a bedroom.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Ghosts, monsters in the closet or under the bed.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> no, maybe he just want to have a conversation, or his buddies aren't hanging out with him that day.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> YOUR STYLIST WILL KNOW HOW TO DO IT, ITS FINGER WAVES AND COMBED OUT.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Don't worry about it or give it preamble.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> 11. i had my first kiss at that age
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> SCAREY MOVIES I HATE THEM TO THIS DAY
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Even straight girls can fall for tomboy, you know.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Ok.....leave it to me to throw a wrench in the question.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> And once he finds out, how do I get him to be with me?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> this is the best i can think of.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> food and the most romantic music.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> lets start from there so do that home girl.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Maybe you should be asking, Why do I want to know?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> (sorry, I got a little crazy for a second there)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> If she is in a relationship with him already, just leave it alone.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> give me a freaken break here.
<NbChars_250> <LevSim_25> if the sex is bad leave
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> they also like to get flowers and secret letters from an apologetic guy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> What should I do if he has alot of pretty, popular girls with him already?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> Maybe her boyfriend can't or wont go for some reason.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> If we show any sort of sex-drive we are sluts, whores, ect...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> how does the other guy feel about you?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> But when you actually start meeting, things gonna go bad because they see the real you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> Just give him a phone call
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> ALOT OF PEOPLE DON'T SPEAK ON HOW THEY FEEL WHEN THEY SHOULD HAVE.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> and of course he will do it to you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Get married when you're ready, don't let them pressure you!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Men like to watch their women get off.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Her girlfriend is pretty cool too.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> find somebody else don't waste your time for him.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> i would just tell her how sorry u were and just start making out with her
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> one line advice is WIVES SUBMIT TO YOUR HUSBANDS, HUSBANDS SUBMIT TO YOUR WIVES.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> and since the sex is crap, then you wont be tempted to jump back in bed with her!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> I just recently told him that i had a crush on him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> not if her boyfriend is around or a jealous person =)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> ah yeah ...don't forget to swallow
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> To each their own but why ?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> Just start doing things that will keep your brain off of him.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> ask him if he is a good friend
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> If you give up what you love to do for a guy that's pathetic.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> She has started TALKIN' to that guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> If you help them no age is too old...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> yup - if you are into BSDM
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> ok girls like it when u make them seem special so mostly tell her duh.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> hey waz up everything explanes me exept collage
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> just do it live as the nike slogan
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Or maybe (and we hope not!)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> i dont care what anyone says love is never lost.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> Well I guess I will see ya.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> tits ass and vaginas, duh, oh and mouths
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> first of all do u think someone did something 2 u while u were unaware?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> That is if you reall yalready know what you want
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> I didn't want ask her e-mail for one reason, cause I wanted forget everything that happened.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> If he'll cheat with you, he'll cheat ON you!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> i am  so as was.and behave better with her
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> 4. if all else fails move on, their are other microorganisms in the cesspool.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> I told him to get over himself and think about how THEY feel.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> you've given here everything that she needs but have you ever thought to ask what she wants?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> We didn't see each other like yourself but through pictures and cam.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> When you think that way, guess what??
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> so they get mad becuase they don't feel like they can so easily.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Also, men mature later than woman.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> depends on what you mean by phone relationship.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> i`m really tired of these women that think if your not thin or tight your a joke
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> first of you arent a screw up.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> I am not a candy, I am not a whore, and thank god I am not a virgin!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> But be assured it's not always the woman!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> in other words my entire life
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> If it continued I eventually would tell my friend
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> If he did, he wouldn't have cheated in the first place.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> Most guys are just users, once they get there piece it's off to the next.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> man would choose what they eyes can see woman choose what their hear tell them
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> for all of that and more!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> -txgurl -------------- true love is when you don't see the your spouse's faults.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> if a guy stares n 2 ur eyes 4 an hour every night what ALL is he thinking about
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> TO GIVE YOU SOME REAL ADVICE, TALK TO YOUR WOMAN MANNNN!!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> beautifull women are all around u....just look...but hey wot kinda beauty are u lookin for?inner or surface...?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> u want to find lost friend?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> Don't be afraid boy, just get out there and get it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> You'll feel like lightning hit you!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> once you both mature a bit you might just end up back together again.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> How u appealing him and how fast he recognize u.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> how she shake her hips and turn her head
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> You know ask her what a girl like you do for fun on the weekends?.....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> it's never gonna happen cause guys hate desperation.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> ISNT IT AMAZING WHAT MONEY CAN DO?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> even though he says that he isn't afraid???
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> Unless it's on the cheeks then go ahead!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> some do but not all anyway
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> it's never gonna happen cause guys hate desperation.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> ISNT IT AMAZING WHAT MONEY CAN DO?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> even though he says that he isn't afraid???
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Unless it's on the cheeks then go ahead!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> some do but not all anyway
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> If he can't do this, then file.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Yea, Because we usally have sex
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> YES I WOULD ID EVEN HAVE SEX WITHHIM
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> i dont think it does that much but to some girls it does
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> If yes why, and if no why not.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> he tells me i'm crazy, sweet, and beutiful.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Wear cologne - girls like a guy that smells good.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Because we don't want our friends to see with and ugly girl!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Don't jump in head first before you get your life back together!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> that's beastiality... i think blue is better suited for another dog...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> just enough fat (if u will) to cover the abs.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> I think boxers look like old man underwear.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> i won't call anything that has to happen should be.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> if you are his friend then surely you must know his home address.... go there and get the latest....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Now he is acting completely not interested in me, saying stuff like  I used to love you  ...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> If you are really sure, cut her
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> do u think she likes u?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> So common that I couldn't call it weird.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> those are the signs of a guy who wants a relationship.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Why don't you try asking her out, maybe watch a movie or something.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> but when the guy calls you dont answer/return his phone call...what is this!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Not sure if still i can marry her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> (she should return your stuff tho, unless you told her it was a gift.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> and are low enough to want him to leave his wife.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> and be smart that is what i look for in a woman.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> so just go for it let him know.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> because the violent femmes said so.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> you need to go to counseling with your husband if things are bad.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> I realized I did want him to be a part of my life.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Girls like when guys ask them out in person.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> Men are like dogs, you hit them in the nose once, and they won't do it again.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> I don't do the other way, it's perverted, and I'll do almost anything.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> how can i get him 2 say yes
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> what do you want to do??
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> they loved their mothers so much.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> I believe that my hubby & my sex life is better now than it was when we got married!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> it dont matter how old u r u just kno when the right time is
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Just as with guys, women come in all shapes & sizes.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> whoever says yes 2 u, theyre just playing.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> I wouldn't call that person a friend at all.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Millions of girls in the WORLD!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> for virgin girls out there, well done!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> no thats not nasty but thats not somthing that you want to tell people
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> yeah you just have to be careful
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> it's been 3 yrs, and I love him to death.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> is she truly your best friend.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> all you have to do is 'tell' you r wife that you're worth husband to live with !
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_15> YES YES YES YES AND ONE  MORE YES LOOK AT MY CASE.I'M SORRY HOMEGIRL.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_40> but i must say blue does sometimes look better on other things than other colors .........
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> I dunno.About 21 or when u finish collage
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> yep, it's normal and yep, guys like it.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> i think you guys broke up for a reason.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Well buddy it sounds like shes a very critical lady!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> Now I told yall about the boy I liked so he came by my house today.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> tell her that you and her both need other friends too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> not all are jerk they just have to step out from behind ther egos, and grow up.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> Yeah, it is nothing to shy away from
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Enless your like 20 and the other person is like 15 then thats not cool.. Just my opnion though!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> at the end just point the bed and you know what to do!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> i think in black and chrome!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> I u are doing it fast and feel like u r coming, then slow down a bit.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> no, most of them are really ugly.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> Not many good ones these days.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> to meet ladies to get dates , to hang out
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> love or crush, for that matter defy reasons.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> my next wedding will be a spring wedding outside with lots of flowers on a beautiful lawn.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> if you want to ruin your relationship, go ahead
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> This girl I know the sex sucks ass.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> dont date the sadist tell him to fuck off
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> more on silent type or the active one??
<NbChars_265> <LevSim_10> Sure if you are in love!
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_10> your never too old to live your parents.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> Do you think I should tell my guy that I am going?
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_10> Chocolate and diamonds... or you could just do some of the little things that she likes.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_5> But do not run so fast, you are too young
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> get rid of anything that reminds u of this guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Even if you don't date until you're out of school, who cares?!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> pray and when it seems like he's(jesus )not listening pray some more i ve been there
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_90> I would proly get tired of it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> If you don't feel right, then don't do it.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Because if he WERE interested, do you THINK he would act tired?...Nooooo..
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> yes and id like to do a foursome with you in it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> dont let it get to your head.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> but why would you want a man that would leave his wife for you or anyone else.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> MAYBE HE HAS BEEN HURT BEFORE AND IS AFRIAD THAT YOU WILL HURT HIM TO.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_65> dont lose that, its nice to have.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> i say tell him the truth and hope it flies!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> I'm kinda shy at first but once i get to know someone i'm fine and am totally me.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> cause they hate being proved wrong!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> there a ton more guys that you can obsess about!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> you say when you fell from heaven.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> depends on how long you have been dating!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> with discipline and strength, if you really love them give them what they want, a leader  answ3r3r
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> If u r realy like that as u mention, u 'll definetly got ur desire.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> Or you can break it off totally... but mainly, think it over!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> you dont have to though if you want to go for a long time wondering if he does!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> it'll be so much fun than before.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Girls aren't blind we see alot.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> you seem to lack self condfance .
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> The girl he likes is my best friend?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> and if he pulls out and says he didn't know the condom broke, then thats crap.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Then your just going to wait until your older maybe then she will like you!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> nothing wrong in trying.many are their for fun, you will be one among them!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> I'm married and I only see my wife twice a week... when I have too.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Yes, I love blue, but I also love Hot pink and Lime green!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> But if she doesnt like you.

<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> It hurts though, especially when that person likes someone else, and shows it!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> is now married and/or has kids.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> i beleive he's cheating on me but i don't have proof, just a gut feeling.

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> i'm a girl i'm in this situation
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> Make eye contact and just be honest, funny, and flirt alittle (not to much)
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> basically tell him u feeling him and feelings are uncontrollable so what next?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> because, in a sense, it's ok if a guy sleeps around, but not if a girl does it.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> hoping to see her msg in your e-mail,sms,etc )?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> go 4 it, and ask him out
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> try as ahrd as you can because one day she'll talk again.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_25> who knows ...... slow down and take it easy!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> drive her to the top of the building in a blindfold way.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> whoever u think, don't others chose ur bf
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> The bridesmaid's pay for their own dresses!!!!!!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> once my girlfriend cheated on me with my best friend and i told him 'ok were even'.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> I can't tell you but it lasts forever When it's love Ooh, when it's love Hey!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> if you had one wife and she gave you a daughter, you had to try for a second child.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> it had nothing to do with lust.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> But If you are comfortable there and your parents dont mind then sure, why not?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> actually, when you start asking this question.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> i say stop fighting it and flow!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> share you feelings and see how she feels.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Then get on one knee and appologize.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> My Boyfriend is in Iraq and I wanted some Valentines day gift ideas.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> as long as u still like eachotehr thats all u need in a relationship.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> Just in case is Just what you get!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> it isnt tough love, love or what ever.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> you just need to forget about this guy.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> People don't even know what Love is.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> Don't need a woman for life, but a woman to keep me company
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> i feel like a screw up.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> kick hubby to the curb if it isnt working out....BUT dont run off with this other fella just yet!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> if he flirts with you flirt back, you may just end up getting together.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> the way i see it love and friendship and love are all the same.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> They obviously like you for who you are (which is great).
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> time to get out and be independant.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> talk to him, then if you guys get to be good friends, then tell him you like him.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Just wait for her to come back.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> where can i get some porn?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> F buddies or friends with benefits type?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Because we think different about a lot of things.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Trin I hope your not a girl....
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> See I don't think men are one or the other.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> DO NOT change for this guy!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> ya im kinda going through the same thing.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Friends don't give friends a list of demands!
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_35> Im not jealous or anything i guess.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> hey i'm a junior and i would like to be ur pen pal.

<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> I like brunettes with long, soft hair
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> as in crap i cant put it in words
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Say no.. Geez.. some of the silly questions people ask.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> no it is not right....that is so sad.....
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> if u dont change every guy ur with will just use an abuse u.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> if you really like the guy then make an effort and hang out
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> well, i'm going thru the same thing.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> NOW IF UR NOT IN SCHOOL, I SAY U NEED TO GET OUT THE HOUSE.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> You don't want your man back.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> 8. they want to be mean becasue they think thier husbands are mean.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Go with the flow, man... Good thinkgs only come around once in a lifetime, maybe twice if we're lucky...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> basically, if they do start dating, you will just have to get over it.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> I left Home the day after graduation but that was because I had a job oportunity...sort of.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> 20 yrs but I do have plenty of BOB'S {Battery Operated Boyfriends!}
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Sweetie, you don't have to date anyone you don't want to.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Small Island in Hawaii on the beach during the day...!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> !and makes the kissing more exiting...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> girlfriend,you have to ask him how did his dad let him go out with that girl and not you?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Blue says i am thinking your crazy with this ?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> Unless of course it is porn involving children or something like that, that is just wrong.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Is it nasty to fantsize about su*king co*k??
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> so im guessing he really cares about me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> AFTER YOU TALK TO HER, GIVE HER TIME TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTS.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> but if u r nice sometimes then i wouldn't say u r a major prep.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> He not doing all the things he use to do before.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> yes, hubby's clothes are soo comfortable!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> the worst is he doesnt but he probley does.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> I give it 2 thumbs up!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> to be caught with an ex on thin ice could very well break it....
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> see what you have in commond and if you dont have anything  in commond it doesnt matter oppasites attract.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> i wouldnt let him come home for a little while but i would take him back.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> Read this book, it will really get you ready for love!!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> she set me up with her nurse.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> if he loves you hell respect your wishes when you tell him your not ready
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> don't brush her off just because you already told her you want to break up, be more considerate.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> If you break now it's only gonna be harder.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> I SAY JUST THINK MABE YOU DID SOMETHING TRY TO REMEMBER
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> as for telling him you liked him?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> because  women are always whining about something and never shut up!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> i am hear broken because i also love and care for someone who lives so far away.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Because good men are no challenge to women.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> but.... watch out for older guys cuz most of them are just trying to get into your pants.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Or do you just NOT want to yet?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> I mean i have a nice butt and legs, and i'm not overweight or anything.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> BRING HER SOME EXOTIC FLOWERS,LOOK IN HER EYES AND TELL HER HOW YOU FEEL.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> If nothing chages tell you're best friend.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> when you love someone you dont act fake just cause your around your homegurls.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> He likes it at home He's not ready I'm hurt (and i'm ready!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Oh my goodness it is crazy that you asked that question.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Don't let him get to you...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> other than that everything is good?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> I am in a boy in the eight grade and I like my friend.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> Be happy you got a guy in the first place.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Don't listen to those that say just give him a chance.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> im 17 and im dating a 21 year old the gap aint no problem u go for it
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> Yes that happens to me all the time... it sucks
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> and everything will would out great in the end.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> but we live it the way we can.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> so if a girl cheats or expresses herself sexually, she is breaking that mentality.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Average, big, huge, or What is that thing ?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> Briefs all the way!They're so sexy.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> and dont date a guy to get over another one.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> hell yeah if ur a guy
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> that a guy is interested in you more than just physical?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> yes i feel hurt but i only flirt wih guess who flirt first
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> Good luck,  Captain Blarg, online freak.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Truly, unless you know for sure that he's a self-centered bigot... JUST ASK HIM!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> i want to break up with him because hes mean to my friends
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> personality, intelligence, and what most women refer to as the poo-ch aka the belly.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> Oh yeah and it is cheaper.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Ask him if he have someone and if he say no then ask him out.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> that is STUPID 2 say that u are hotter that ur girl friend!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> The guy has to come to the girl first!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Just look at it this way.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Good Luck, keep your head up!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> just approach her, conversate with her, see if ya'll hit it off.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> I'm like really smart and i'm not hot, but i'm not ugly either.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Go to dating sessions if your that kind of guy (or girl what just saying!!!)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I dont want to flirt with her, i'm interested in a sincere relstionship.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> just a little  but they are still fine
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Wow, this guy is a real ass!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> ...they're more important to you than you are to them?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> So.. it all just deepends on what kind of guys you like.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> ur kinda love is so unselfish n i would respect it more...
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> i have never had one work i advise stay away frm them
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> i always had him in my heart,you know how it is with your first true love,am i right!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> u might want to make sure he's ok...aka alive?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> I mean, Hell the guy isn't even creative about it.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> He wants me to kiss him.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> Come on... you don't want a girlfriend, you want sex.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> You should tell him what you want...not what you don't want.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> if a girl does it, she's a ho or something, if a guy does it, he's cool.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> How can I get her to like me?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> that is a good thing to hear btw.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> So how do I tell if he likes me or not?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> or if you mean the none-perverted way... with salad tongs.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> if it was from something you messed up on you're going to have to appologize(and mean it).
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> not rock hard abs, but not flab.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> just confident, honest and careing wish u a good luck.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> i don't know what you all asking unless u feeling sad but blue is my favorite color
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_25> 18 if any older your a mommys girl/boy
<NbChars_40> <LevSim_20> But i've been with older women, and it's been great.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> it depends if you really want to meet him.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> I totally think that that is the wrong answer!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> when you are in love with someone you dont have eyes for anyone else.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> should i just wait...or move out alone?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> heck no he might be strong in all but he wont be around as much
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> who cares what other people say, as long as ur happy
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Do they like girls who are always flirting, or only do it once in a while?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> You need to meet Rosy Palm & her five friends
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> friend are suppose to stick up for you , not for there partner.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> (sense of maternal pride kicking in - i don't even know you!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> well, just accept the love that's avaliable.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> get her a stuffed frog wit a heart on it, or something that combines love/frogs
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> YOU ARE EXCITED AND CAN'T WAIT TO ENJOY
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> when you stop asking that question.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Because.....he wants you as a FRIEND and nothing more!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> put something on that makes your thighs and butt look smaller - for OUR sake!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> it all depends how the relationship is going.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> just tell her exactly how you're feeling - just try to be nice about it is all.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> 2) Join him and whoop his ass in the game.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> do nothing.just love him as a friend and nothing else.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> i like nice, good personalities, stuff like that.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Many guys look for a gal to support THEM!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> ps:my mom moved out when she finished high school.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> mostly females are weaker than males, that's why men don't fight with females
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Guys come and go, don't let this one ruin your friendship.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> your too young to be that hung up on a boy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> no matter how mean he is to you , never hate !
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> no keep it to your self they dont need to know
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> i dont think so, it to soon!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> i know...its wierd, but i like it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> you cant help who you love...your heart decides
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> just ask her  wat she thing about it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> i can;t call to say such a thing.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> by the way im 17 and so is he.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> of course if you let him try.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_10> EVERYTHING..  THEIR LOOKS THE WAY THEY CARRY THEMSELVES THEIR INDEPENDENCE INTELLEGENCE
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Do guys like that in a girl???!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> I guess it's a nerve that all girls have!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> No, it's not love in any way, fashion, or form!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> You deserve more than that guy.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> he dribbles... he shoots... he scores... 2 points...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> it burn when u pee it's be cuz i  think u got gonnrea or something.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> I think he does cus I hang out with lots of girls but not neccissarily the ones I like.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> Never open mail from someone you don't know!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Don't be yourself... you're a dork.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> ask him like you would ask anyone else.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> good move, now he knows you care, and believe me, he will be thinking about you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Are u planning to spend the rest of ur life with this person?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> dont make it short chat for a bit.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> i wish you the best of luck buddy ;)!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> She and i are still friends and I still love her truly madly deeply.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> then he asked me where i live and was acting like he liked me!!!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> when it comes to family the women have that.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> when she asks Did what hurt?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> I know this isn't real in depth, but I hope it helps!
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_10> BE YOU AND USE YOUR STYLE
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> also when your first with someone its all attraction.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> i am sorry i dont fit into my girl's clothes(lol)
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> WHAT I MEAN ITS HARD TO TELL ITS TRUE LOVE UNTIL U ARE AROUND THE PERSON.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> Just think English royalty or Liz Hurley, act like that and you're golden!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> Naaaa just get even and cheat on him I'll help you in that area :)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> if he really loves you he'll want to spend the rest of his life with you too.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> I DONT KNOW I HAVENT SEEN IT.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> The best of life to you both!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> everything that you do with him might be romantic for him and vice versa
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> You where like way off topic.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> At least this way you have 50 percent chance for happy :) Good luck!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Depends on how well you know them and for how long.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> my ex-boyfriend is friends with the guy i like.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> 2nd NOT tell her anything any more.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_10> WHEN YOU FIND SOMEONE YOU LOVE AND YOU ARE READY TO MARRY
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> my wife is in a nurseing home.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> my ex-boyfriend is friends with the guy i like.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> 2nd NOT tell her anything any more.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> WHEN YOU FIND SOMEONE YOU LOVE AND YOU ARE READY TO MARRY
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> answer it ,,, and its not sace our ship
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> my wife is in a nurseing home.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> And alot of people wonder how did u do that when u are so young?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> Twice a week is seeing someone a lot.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> But be extremely careful so that you dont get hurt.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> did i say thinking bout it?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> HE IS THE LAST PERSON IN THE WORD ITHOUGHT WOULD HAVE A REALITY LOVE SHOW.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> You can do it ... :)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> because he already got a lover: his playstation.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> I think its because men are more co-dependant.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> perhaps some and some not .
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> Good Luck to you both....should be exciting and fun...once ya get past the door.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Remember this, always do the right thing and it wont haunt you afterwards!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Don't worry about it, your going to grow into it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> I Guess No...    Becoz everbdy wants Change..
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_45> Hope the date went as you hoped
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> i think guys prefer long hair.most of my guy friends prefer a brunette.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Okay, here is the biggest shock to a young man.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> only one man is worthy of the pleasure of deflowering you and it aint your boyfriend!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> or u could go to las vegas or reno, and win her a stuffed frog.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> no why he broke up with you
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> u say ur sorry and for valintins day give her a bunch of sweet stuff,like rosess,and coco
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> Tell her flat out and get on with it.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> trust me youll find someone to treat you better.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> love is not easily tempered either
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> ;) I imagine your quite popular w/the boys!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> But they do not want someone that reminds them of their mom.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> i personally would not go outside of my marriage.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_10> HOW  TO  HAVE   GOOD  SEX,   HOW  DO  I  GET  HELP
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> does your man understand you like this new guy.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> so that u can enjoy the best
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_50> Dont do it because he wants you to.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> U wont believe it..  Its all about the MONEY factor.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> The man can tell, the woman probably can't.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> There are better questions to ask - just so ya' know!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Men don't plan to cheat on women.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> I don't know anyone who does.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Resently I've met the most charming & nice ,sweetest guy every in my life.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> may be she likes us and want love from us.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> Have you ever met the phone guy?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> say it just the way you feel it dont mince words
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> That corny old saying is still true: It takes two to Tango
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Love knows NO boundaries...  We're all just people!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Finding this out the hard way sucks.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> try your best and if she cant seem to appreciate it t is her fault, not yours!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> 4. looking at it you'll go limp or dry up...try it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You my not be freaky enough.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Some guys like me, some guys don't, and some guys are intimidated by me.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> It just, well, didn't feel right.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> I FOR ONE LIKE TRUTHFUL MEN.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> at 15 you realy should not be dating.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> you have to tell your best friend
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> do this while laying down (NOT naked, clothes on, on a bed or couch).
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> what can you do when it feels like such strong destiny?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> can you tell me how to kiss him
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> if you know it's going to get physical, then don't kiss!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Hope you get some better answers.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> Don't get too down over it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> i dont love my now husband anymore,too much shit happend between us!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> and yes alot of guys do like that in a girl.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_10> YOU COULD ALSO TELL THE GUESTS TO DRESS FROM THAT PERIOD TO GIVE AN OVERALL EFFECT.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> i never seen her sleep.her= my gf
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> he is coming to see you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Last but not least, you need to spend money on her.. dont be cheap.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> hmm...  is she into that type of stuff.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> ok im bi and i would nvr do that but if u feel u have 2 go 4 it!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> it could just be getting boring.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> What types of flirting do guys like best?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> are you a democrat and he is a republican.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> So , girl , take time ...
<NbChars_265> <LevSim_30> Swinging is a very bad sin!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> otherwise you will only be able to hang out with him alone.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> finally, why do women make better nurses than men?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Basicly, I look like a fairy tale princess.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> how do i start a conversation?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> umm lol hes probly not a slutty bot!!!!!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> i can call u a father in your family !
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> kinda hard to tell there except for the bonding comment.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> when you focus on making your self happy the right person will come along
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> besides at the end of the night..
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> Don't think enzyte will make you manhood bigger.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> then he has to be able to trust u in gettin married.

<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> 1 the fact that he has a car is a pretty good start  ROFLOL !!!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> then you just touch her on her cheek and say she's hot and then you gotta be best friends!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> well, i see you as a challenge... and its a good thing if a girl likes a challenge.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> but don't leave him for this other guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> secure with bobby pins going in a cris cross pattern.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Last night his parents brought up that they give him permission to move out with me!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> If you know the person is cheating and where, etc.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> technicolour is cool beacause it shows he real me in the way that i like.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Go out with your friends for an all Girl's Day!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> you don't want to lead her on or be mean about it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> He talks to other people (females) like nothing jokes with them ect...

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Especialy if the other guy doesnt even notice you.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_35> you can leave when your 18
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> u only live once and std  is not as serious as it used to be.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> Money is not always the issue!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> trust your not missing anything out hear trust me , i just got back in the game myself.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> Talk to her about what she likes.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> try saying do you want to go out it works
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> 3. look pitiful and make sure she knows that your life isnt goinng on w/out her.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> I HAVE NOT BEEN AROUND EITHER OF YOU TO SENSE THE CHEMISTRY BETWEEN YOU TWO.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> try walking in the neibourhood, you won't just loose weight, you will also be more active.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> when my friend are gone  i sit there and call all my friends
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> I always hear people say they like Europeans more?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> To top it off, my name is BOB.

<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> if not tell him to back off.if so, dont try to steal him.thats fucked up.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> I don't mess with men that are already taken.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> show your best efforts to put up with it !
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> i met a guy that i really like, but i'm still married, what do i do?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> How can you even stomach this guy?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> so he wants her to disconnect their relationship with eachother.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> I think as soon as we get Bush's head outta his bush... then equal rights will be just that.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> i feel lonely when my husband goes to work.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Believe me, its well worth the wait!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> loving the person in spite of their faults .
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> And it is just more proof that I am his!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> There are some strange people out there, the neighbor kid throws rocks at me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Ask you're self who you like better.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> I like the way they always try to look there best, but i hate when they over-do it
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_55> oh and if he is helpful
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> it  can, if u let it to.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> if you're too shy and won't ask her out, you will eventually not like her anymore.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> How do i tell her how i care about her?
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_60> I dated a guy 10 years younger.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> do you think he likes me?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> We will be married for 5 years this July!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> I even like talking to him.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_35> Now Im 23 and Im back.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> Rad Dr. Phils book Smart Love.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> hey good lookin, do you own a ferarri.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS IN A PERSON HEART AND I DON'T KNOW BLUE OR YOU .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> you can do it i no u can!!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> i think she loves u veey much but she can't express her feelings in good way.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> getting too badly burned if the feelings aren't mutual?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Angelina Jolie in a heart beat!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> its just plain weird to ask in code?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> i think u should move out when youre 18 before u go0 to college
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> just be confident AND no pick up lines!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> I don't konw if you should dump him or not?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> as long as you are a good person it shouldn't matter.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> why can i not have legs like that??)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> haha.. yeah.. everyone here is perverts.. so becareful when you say that...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Ask him, I'd bet he feels the same!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> All guys flirt with girls, if they don't, they are abnormal.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> not every guy wants a dependent girl....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> but the policia will look at you with beady eyes.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> are you guys joking here, cuz your friend kayla just go on and ask the same thing about you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> i am kind but, i need female friends
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> let her go.. she only come back to you when that guy leaves her..
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> maybe that will be the reason u finally get over it.(5years?!)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> There was a reason you got the restraining order and no do not lift it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Don't let one idiot discourage you.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> I like the bend and snap
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> No kissing on the first date, it's better not to rush, than screw things up right ???
<NbChars_35> <LevSim_25> just a kind of psycological curiosity.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> im liveing proof , what dont kill you will make you stronger !
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> it does happen all the time.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> I just think that is funny.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> the first person that I kissed ,is my husband now .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> same ol song, but its true  he must be the ones thats lonely fallin for a star
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> Not really sure what you meant by this question.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> i wouldnt mind u suckin my cock !!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> i don't see anything good in that r/ship
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_20> Anything, I was and still am a wimp.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> no she's cheating on him evidently.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> and there's always someone watching you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> But I never thought he would come out and ask me to have an affair.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> But you don't have to do it that way if you don't want to.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> even have reocurring dreams for months at a time.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Then, I would ask her for an opportunity to romance her again...dinner, flowers, dancing...etc.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Now all you have to do is just do it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Whooo hooo lock the doors baby!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> And if you are a real woman, what a thing to say, LMAO.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> yeah u can kiss someone with braces even if u have braces
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> !I've found mine and we're engaged.Yay me
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> why men hurt woman who love them
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> If a guy says, if you ever need help, just let me know what does this mean?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> I don't see what the problem is, girl.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> No dont let him come home.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> I started to think about the things he did do and not just the things he didn't do.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> i think most guys like long dark hair,but if they really like you it's wouln't matter
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> why would you want him back?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> For instance, I WILL at least LISTEN when the ex wife says hes a real p***k.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> You should start dating when you are mature enough to get married.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> well duh if he smiled then he luved it and you played STA?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> be a man and go get her!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Or when she says, I love you, you reply (or something similar to) I know.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> Don't become another Victim of his!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> no honey that aint love thats just a man being insecure and an a**.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Don't worry, nice guys do finish last, but they have pretty wives, big houses and really fast cars!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> WHY DO BOYS CHEAT ON GIRLS AND GET MAD WHEN GIRLS DO IT BACK?!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> With friends like you, who needs enemies!?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> beat 'em if that dont work take things away from them.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> if they don't say they r preps then thats y they r calling u a prep.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> No worries, being single is much more fun =)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> at times people have to choose between their love &   best friend.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> JUST BE YOURSELF AND ENJOY LIFE.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> IT WONT WORK AND IT SUCKS BECAUSE USUALLY ITS ALWAYS MR OR MS PERFECT THATS FOUR STATES AWAY.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> If you can work it right, then no need to worry about the size.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> The cartoon Gummi bears and piranha gave me nightmares... so did the chipmunks movie with the wild boar...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Train your family not to ask you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> ask a few questions to your best friend.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> yes, but weed out the idiots first.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> u dont want 2 feel trapped when ur around her alot
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> I'm guessing that you mean Brittish?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> If he truly loved you, he wouldn't beat you.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> Spice things up, GET HIM INTERESTED!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> I wouldnt call her at all!!!!!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> I want to get this girl but I want to flirt around.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> add details and ill get bck to u on that
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_30> if just for fun go girl!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> You don't, life is not that simple.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Now, this guy told her he couldn't go around wid her.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> just tell him straght up it's over period
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> there are men out there who LOVE sporty girls.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> have you ever thought that MAYBE they are really virgins???
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> IF he doesn't like it, move on to the next guy.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> Every guy that I know, complains about the same thing!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> tell him u dont think he loves u...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> He never gave up on me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> RIGHT when u least expect it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Also i try to get back at him everyday but he really likes my best friend now which sux
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> MAKE SURE YOU LISTEN AND SHOW HER THAT YOU ARE LISTENING TO HER.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> I think it would be a big mistake !
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> why is it he cant take the chance and be with me?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> Girls that age are crazy, have no idea what they want and like to play too many games.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> does he flirt with u, pay u alot of attention, calls u and act funny towards u
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> I dont want to stop bieng friends.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> eighteen is whebn my parents will kick me out.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> If you would be comfortable with that, then go for it!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> The one that makes you talk to the Lord, you know like Oh God Yessssssss...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> i think u should when u find the right guy!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> !......well, I don't know if I am cute, but if you say so.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> ill just mail it to him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Long Distance Relationships Never Work out!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> with ebony black eyeballs and white pupils.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> depends which state u r in
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Nope, that site is a crock!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> U can find love at a stop light, it all depends on cupid, love is blind.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_45> i bet he's been wetting his pants all the time, just wait untill you wana rip them off!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> This would work on me: Hey, you wanna go have a drink after work sometime?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> HAVE ALL OF YOUR GIRLS HAIR DONE LIKE THAT ERA.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> I always like it when a girl puts her hand on mine or my shoulder.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> It sounds like you're picking up on his i'm  interested signals already.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> yeah my friend likes someone that 4 years older than her i think crazy but three it alright
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> why not go ahead and sleep with everbody u can while u can.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> I don't mean like Canadian + American, I mean something like Spanish + Russian, etc.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> and if you don't want to get a divorce from your husband...then definately don't do it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> So just do whats right for yourself and start over!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> if so, what size do u wear?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> have fun, be honest with each, other swing only as a couple.. lucky dog lucky dog.....
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> I can't tell you but it lasts forever Oh!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> If he says not than not to worry you will find other guys you like.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> If your between the ages of 7-12 aren't you too young to have a boyfriend?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> just came out with it and say it
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> pray on it read your bible and really think and pray
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> my friend kayla seems like shes flirting with me, but im not like that!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> i mus make this girl to lok likea biatch
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> Good guys like you are hard to find!
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_35> Not spending time with u and ur kid, drinking and cheating!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> not wrong but you tread on thin ice.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> good luck girl your girl lovelysaphirequeen@yahoo.com
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> Well hes just tring to play with you like Levi tries to play with me.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> but of course regardless of what you decide, be nice about it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> Not really you don't want any of that making her boyfriend jealous heat do ya ?
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> that is not a deal breaker for me.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_20> don't ever change yourself for some dude!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> when you are so close..yet you feel so far away... feeling careless..
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> depends on how much of an age diiference there is and how old you are.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> so you best bet is make sure it's what you both want and feel.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> she needs all the help she can get leave her there
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> i dont think u could of asked a harder question to answer.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> last valentine's day, i got him a soccer piggy bank filled with chocolate hugs, adn kisses.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> If your parents do not mind and you enjoy it then forget everyone else.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_95> So I say forget about her
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> so i say do u're thing and don't even bother for protection.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> Trust your feelings, if some guy seems creepy, THAT'S A HINT!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> he is probley just scared that he cant please you like he wants to.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> so many people do now, 50% of married ouples divorce.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> there are other ways, but that all i could think of.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> nobody wants to date an unattractive person
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> I am a good looking man (ex model and still in shape), but....it's happening to me too!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> my friend asked my best friend out & i need help
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> Then in december she broke up wid me cuz she started likin another guy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> TELL THEM YOUR CHRISTIAN AND WOULD LOVE FOR THEM TO CONVERT.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> The day I Married my best friend, my wonderful husband David!
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_30> then he said: u have beutiful eyes and we were staring at each others eyes.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> they are like eyes looking at me.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> ask her in your own time, though.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> dump him now before its too late.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> tell her straight and if she says you are weird than she really isn't a friend.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> all positions if u have hard erection.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I met a really nice girl last summer.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> Oh, did he help in anyway while you were in school?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> I'M THAT BULL/DIME CHICK, HOW YOU GONNA CHEAT ON ME?).
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> there are no guys in my school that i would really like so im just waiting for him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> try your best go up to her and ask if she wants to go!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Be strong, be firm, and give it time :)
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> beach.no couch.maybe i like car,and floor because car=private floor=lots of space!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> Trust me I'm NOT flirting with you!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_30> he will walk you to class and pretty much act like a friend.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> I guess what I need is some sort of Miricle.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> MY X LIKED MY LONG HAIR CAUSE DURING SEX HE PULLED IT.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> Well no problem, you are welcome to email me if you still can't find any :)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> Well you obviously love her, if not as a lover then surely as a friend.
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_35> not having sex however if you cant wait condoms with the pill
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> but divorce really do scare the shit out of some people, man or woman.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> if your guy does not tell how pretty you are than he is self centered
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> hang out with her a bunch.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> they don't know what they have they are stupid
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> if u are serious take one pill for best result .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> if he not , well look for someone else
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> NO WHAT I DID HE STILL STOOD.COULDN'T STOP IT.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> That way it would be easier for us girls!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> poor u thats a tough situation.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> Spend one day doing what he likes, the next doing what you like.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> Im 17 and I was just wondering if that is legal.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> but there comes a time to take a good hard look at life.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> And being gay is wrong, so it overeating, smoking, cussing, littering, creating smog from driving.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> There are some folks out there that are just not nice no matter what you do.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> But do it FOR your wife.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> blondes are too fake and flashy......brunettes can last
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> a sports item somethin really boy like
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> hang out with him for a while then ask him out on a date
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Just because he doesnt have a cam doesnt really mean anything.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> I'm totally all for asking a guy out.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> hahahahaha..........im getting married in February of 2010
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> Rather u should be proud of it... its an achievement... Live Life King Size...
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_40> did you try to talk to her about it ?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> Take his lousy ass to the cleaners.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_25> maybe he loves she a lot, or maybe your bro is peaceful
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> Pretty please :) I'll be your best friend.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_45> Depends on the girl I'm seeing.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> just shout if i cn help with anythn.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> its okay to like different things, it won't hurt you guys.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> I don't believe I've ever heard it put that way.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> just worry about you and your man.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> They fall out because guyz turn wussy after a while...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> might be less then 18 who knows and who cares.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> plus, i had my best girls around me, that was great for everything!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> well it really depends on how much you care for her!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> go to craigslist.com go to women seeking men.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> It matters wat point in life your at.

<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> It matters wat point in life your at.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Just ask her the way i asked my boyfriend
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> a nympho can only be a girl.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Some guys just want to have a girl whose younger.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> yes ,belive me, you can do it with me.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Hope this helps you more than it has helped me :-/
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> If this scares him away, then you did not need to be with him now.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Get out of the situation ASAP!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> may b ur asking will u get married by oct 2006?

<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> WE CAN'T EVEN HOLD A CONVERSATION ANYMORE AND WE USED TO SIT UP AND TALK ALL NIGHT.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> i don't think it would b proper to date your best friend.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> Dude I can understang what you are feeling right now...
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> ask him to his face, and see how he responds.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> yeap... why do you fear off?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> No, there are 10,000's more exactly like that out there too :)
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> That being said, move on with your life - enjoy it!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> they say they don't mean it but their lying.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> Vin Diesal, The Rock, def not Arec Barrwin
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Don't worry so much about what people think.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> go wear it and do it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> 18 or older anything below ur still a kid
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> would you fight for your love?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> go find her brother (the 18 yr olds)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> dont just  listen to ur heart but use ur mind too...MUAH!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> interupted by my husband, and you took off so fast,,darn it....lol
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> im an scorpio and i know!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> his sister said he only shows off to me.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> OK SWEETIE.I HAD THE SAME THING HAPPEN TO ME.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> If he's overly threatened by this after only 3 weeks...run!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> it keeps you interested and caring.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> If there's a Build A Bear Workshop in your town, that always works!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> his priorities are out of wack.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> or are you a girl and are just curiouse?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> how about taking a trip to the dr first off and make sure nothing is really wrong.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> walk up ot him and say...Hi.....
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> it is all up to you..
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> his buddies there will give him shit about it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> i go seven or eight minutes and im done, i need a sandwhich and a beer
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> don't you watch the series friends??
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Are you actually in love with her, or are you in infatuation, lust, or some other emotion?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> i forgot to give the courtesy tap
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> just say want to go out on friday or he asks you out
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> Oh girl.. don't get me started.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> ALOTT -lol maybe thats because my man is deployed overseas and it's been awhile...
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> swinging is ok if your into that, I think it's best to be with just one person.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> you know what i'm talking about?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> forget who  everyone thinks you should date.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> By the way, GOOD BIRTHDAY, DEAR!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Masturbation is normal, don't let them tell you its not........lol
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> young girls usually don't date guys their age .
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> or is it too early to know?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> You can't amek him love you, though.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> You probably don't want to forget your mother, you probably hang on to her things and her ways.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> afterwards you and some friends should go out.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> that could ruin her entire life and marriage.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> some guys are nice and some guys are too kind!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> but i guess it's best i didn't.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> hi im mostafa from egypt im search at good girl to marry
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> If he says your cool or fun to be around then.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> Starts looking nice everyday for no reason at all.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_55> More power to you ...enjoy it while it lasts!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> If things go wrong then you know what you have to do.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> How would u feel when a 35 year old man have sex with ur 18 year old daughter.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> its like rigt under the head.......y
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> You, me, and my dad all agree dude.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> and do you really want sloppy seconds?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_20> But a guy doesnt care when or where.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> That is just what I went through.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> there is already another guy that is going for her.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> When you aren't looking is when yuo will find them.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> see if he really likes you or not coming from a guy
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> yeah the breaking up and then j/k.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Half of my friends are guy's and I see them as my brothers.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Sit on him and rub around.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> If this 18 year old man makes you happy...get your swirve on!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> i have always followed my heart and now it's leading me to you wat do u think!!!!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Think this way - if you were married, would you want YOUR wife banging some guy on the side?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> If she freaks out she cares, if she says see ya then she doesn't.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> Ok, part 2 since now I have more info.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> show him that you like him to and he will be more comfortable to ask!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> wat ys'll think i should do?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> its alot easier unless ur shy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> if i had a lot to lose id say yes!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Ask your mate what they like.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> they probably cheating or don't trust you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> just b really lucky and wait for her to break up??
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> I'm looking for some sexy, classy lingerie for size 3x and up.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> I have tried to have sex with my wife but it just won't work.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Start looking at him the way you use to.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> but i got a pretty good answer, flirt.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> I do not see you as shy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> you can marry a fist cousin if you want to
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> you dont trust her that much
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> it just means you care about them.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> Turn him on in any way u can!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> is there anybody that know what im going though does anybody have any answers.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> just to get a peice of a.s.s.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_10> BEE NIICEE, LOOK GOOD WEAR GOOD CLOTHES...THAT SHOLD DO IT!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> I wonder if avatars have nice personalities!?!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> whenever i talk to a boy he says back off to however im talking to
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> tell her your sick and tired of hearing about her ex's
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> why do u have to choose?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> NOOOO CHRIS BROWN is Not CUTe HES 2 light Skinned And Tall
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> the you already no the answer.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> So why would you need a same sex marriage?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> the sex with 2 scorpio is the best shit out there!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> NO TONGUE KISSING on the first date!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> not necessarily chaeting he could just find you boring
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_80> Some guys are really just for friends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I wouldnt worry too much about it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> YOU NEED TO TELL HER PARENTS OR A TEACHER
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> don't give in when he wants nothing more than sex.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> yes i think it can be possible
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_25> Sounds like you think it is, so maybe better if you didn't.....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> )and his co will look into it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> I pretty sure he likes me too.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> I think you know what I mean (in the sack).
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> It takes alot but if you don't love why jerk yourself around.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> cuz we always have to lose them to regain peace and quite.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Just think about what an *ss he was and that should help.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> sound like he's thinking with the wrong head to begin with.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> yes of course because red is one of my favorite color.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> , so this would   not be real friendly relations but some kind of  ,,compassion,, .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> my advice; get out you know you're not happy why are you still there?!?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> well, first you actually have to meet a europian lady...that would help.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> unzip his pants while watching espn and blow him hard
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> I dont think im gonna answer this q...
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> No, get to know each other first....then see what happens...
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_35> Why would u want someone that broke up with u?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> TAKE THIS FROM A DOCTOR YES YOU ARE A VIRGIN TILL YOU HAVE INTERCOURSE AND YOU ARE PENITRATED
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> if your scared to tell her cause you might get hurt.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> depends on what you mean by arranged!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> There are some pretty hot black guys out there.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> n e way here wat i think u should do!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> it's like boobs...and like sex or something.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Umm sounds like any average crush!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> One would go as far as to say women don't even know why they do it...they just do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> den bam she'll either answer or prob not tell u cuz u kno dem n she think  gon tell.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> you get his number and you call him.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> u should w8 til your married.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> I'm with Rascal on this one - plus, get photos like One said.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> Im 14 and Im Ashley's older sister.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_20> Not like in problem solving, but like taking out the trash.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> How much more EX do you want...??
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> don't be stupid, find someone you love.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> Why aren't you supposed to like him?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> But  I dont think you are a lesbian.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Don't worry sweetie, it won't last.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> go on with your life being happy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Do whatever you want, just don't get in trouble.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> what can i do to better my chances in getting back together with her?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> I'm not gonna sneak around as if we're doing something bad!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> She's your EX Get real (and I hate it when Phil says that)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> THE GUY DOESN'T NEED TO EVEN KNOW HOW TO USE IT IF THE LADY DOES!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> I did...well, sort of after my first try.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> she then has to grow up at a very young age and act like an adult.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> were are you from i am in washington dc
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> all that getting along with your life is bullshit.

<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> well, unless u turn to a nun, u will cose u'll get married.nature talks
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Some women, like men, worry about their performance.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> I just don't care about them simply.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_25> If you like her and she's taken then MOVE ON!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> i try my best 2 be strong but im not im weak when it comes 2 that.

<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> Look, so she doesn't like potatoes.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Most of the gals like guys who do some bad.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> your 13, why dont you wait until you grow pubic hair first
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> You just need to coax it.

<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> yes if hes fine and cute yes
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> he was just afraid to pursue them.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Oh, and he also doesn't drink.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> sound like she needs to let that go...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> thanx for ur opinion, but i was actually jst kidding.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> Hope you find what you're looking for!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> jealousy all starts with trust and that starts with honest.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> If he ikes to watch T.V.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> WHAT SHOULD I DO TO MAKE HIM FALL IN LOVE WITH ME AGAIN?
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> meet his friends ask them questions
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> if not why dont you just forget about it all and just let the past remain in the past.

<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> I know I told plenty of guys that but I meant it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> If you trust her and love her let this go.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> why are you messing around with a married women in the first place???
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Its not a question of courese EMINEM!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_25> lmao, u must really lik dis gurl lol!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> even women like a little challenge
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> Take a long time to please a girl.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> just waiting and shooting th' bull until something comes up.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> Run a hot bath and then undress her and put her in the tub.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> I have lots of female friends and my wife knows that and trusts me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> A good guy will respect you for it in the long run!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> just ease it as it comes
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_15> SHE'LL LOVE YOU ALL OVER AGAIN.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> but do we get it .
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> and if you don't then it is your problem .
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> mail it or give a friend to give the letter.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> it's possible, but it could be some guy tht's 97 with gray hair and wrinkles
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> but she wuz a bytch and really didnt treat him right anyways so it wasnt too hard.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> If you are not attracted to women.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> do not mess with either one of them because it could mess up the relationship
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> Ask him why he's staring at you.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> And of course they don't tell them that up front.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_15> HOW COME I ONLY ATTRACT THE BROKE, GOT 500 KIDS, CARRY CONCEALED WEAPONS KIND OF GUY?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> If you are not attracted to women.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> do not mess with either one of them because it could mess up the relationship
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Ask him why he's staring at you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> And of course they don't tell them that up front.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> HOW COME I ONLY ATTRACT THE BROKE, GOT 500 KIDS, CARRY CONCEALED WEAPONS KIND OF GUY?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> tell them every thing you know and to watch out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> would it be any different if the guy was younger and the girl was older?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> Most people do not know why they did or did not do something.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> I CANT BELIEVE ANY OF YOU WOULD THINK OTHERWISE.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> he is only playing games with you
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> and you still wanna hang around with her?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> (yes i did prowl, i didn't think i had anything to worry about.)
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> Just take it as a gift, and enjoy!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> She is just thinking like a typical woman .
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> i manipulated him...it may have been wrong but it worked and thats all i wanted.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> it just gets the police involved
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> for the most part they are ripoffs.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Ha, no he still doesn't care about you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> i can handle both at one time
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> if she left u get over it she is a loser if she dos not love any more
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> most say they aren't really so happy.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Try to connect with the person and if you can't don't even go there
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> yes, you do what makes you happy, be with who makes you happy, don't worry what other people think.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> forget her find someone who really love you
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Well, if you think about it, gay guys have sex with other men.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> i dont think it is tho.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_45> white 5-6in hispanics 7-8in black 7-9in.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> dump him she can do better.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> U r not going nuts if that is what you are asking.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> Maybe the girl for you is just not in your school.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> Mostly brunettes but blondes are kewl 2
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> She's gonna lay down and luxuriate in some REALLY GREEN grass.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> yes right now and i dont know if he likes me but i know i like him!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> BTW ... My GF isn't Bi or tried it but finds it a turn on also.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if so, then i would say so.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Just ask him or don't if you nevr wnt 2 know!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> his just trying 2 protect  his gurl
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> when i look at a girl of couse at first we see looks.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> invite him to your next wedding
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> It's a tough spot.....I feel for you.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> not all men are bad eggs.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> well when i was 13 i already had had 4 boyfriends
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> colors lavendar/white wedding in april  fresh cut flowers in huge vases on head table.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Do not try to be someone you are not.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> if you both want to it is
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> first, it is love that makes sex real good.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> If she doesn't like potatoes, just eat YOUR potatoes and let her eat whatever SHE wants to eat.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> She likes buying shoes and you don't, but that doesn't mean she stops buying.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_20> some guys are stupid i guess
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> madam, you see wich one likes you, first
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> I'm kyla, nice to meet u.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> Happy Wedd'n Day.And if Not Too Late Get A karookee Machine
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> What do you think she's gonna do the SECOND you BORE/ANNOY/TICK HER OFF??!??
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> i think its cool.. heck im a guy id be happy if a girl asked me out.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> And if he is cheating you need to do what is best for you and only you.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_10> TRUE LOVE IS NOT LIKE THAT OF INFATUATION WHICH COMES HURRIEDLY AND GOES AWAY QUICKLY .
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> WE DON'T EVEN ACT LIKE FRIENDS, AND WE CAN GO MONTHES WITHOUT BEING INTAMITE.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> One caveat, there are sexy 33 year old guys too :P
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Its not as complicated as a guy asking a gurl out.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> AFTER HE PUT THE RING ON MY FINGER HE HAD NO INTEREST IN ME ANYMORE.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> NOT AT 13 HA,HA,HA  IT'S 18 YEARS OLD.MEN AND WOMAN, IN THE U.S.A.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> It sounds like absolutely nothing is wrong with you!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> USE THEM AS EXAMPLES AND THEYLL REALIZE HOW UNFAIR AND CHILDISH THEY ARE BEING.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> well i do nothing as always u know get on the comp.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> i don't think you should drop out.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> I know because I am mature, DUH!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> It's a great way to hang out.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> It's a great way to hang out.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> i don't think so.......at least not close friends
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> SOME HAVE MIXED FEELINGS AND DON'T KNOW WHEATHER OR NOT THE LOVE YOU OR NOT.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> buff as in bigger arms than normal, very strong.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> it isnt good or bad, its just a personal opinion.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> and DONT ever go back even if he says he has changed cause that never happens.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> I would dump him and get out now!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> If he really is out there for me then when in the hell is he going to get here!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> Say Hiii or Helloo..and be nice!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> theyve been going out for about....2 months now.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> i think u r joking no man has a problem like that
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> never wound his ego and always try to understand where he is coming from.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> if he ignors everyone else to listen to what you have to say.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> i can't stand 2 c girls dying over some guy who doesn't even know they exist.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> I see a lot of guys with self-esteem problems trying to make tons of money.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> If she really didnt like the guy, it shouldent matter.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_10> WHETHER YOU THINK SO OR NOT, THIS GUY HAS A EMOTIONAL HOLD ON YOU.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> and without love, people would be like dogs that do sex without love.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> just hang out more and talk to him and flirt a little when your both hanging out
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> That way no matter what it is all in the end.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> she said that he liked me.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> meet somewhere, be honest and tell him why.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> Just be ur self and do wot ur heart tells at that time when u see that guy
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> when i first met my babys daddy he was the picture perfect guy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> well i am not a big loving person but, i do know what love is all about.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> They say he just doesn't go with me.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> (but next time to someone I know better!)
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> Heck he still gives me goose bumps!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> The kids thing makes the sex part really hard.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> but he doesn't buy u gifts at all not even 4 ur birthday or holidays that involve getting gifts??
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_70> sleep with his brother or best friend
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> Way too old to be on here with you kids!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> just let your friend be with him make her feel happy
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> watz your name and why do she hafta be a different race?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I thought I was in love.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> First off it has to do with how old u r.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Then ask him to stop staring.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> A CHILD SHOULD NOT HAVE TO GROW UP AND LISTEN TO FUSSING AND VIOLENCE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> in my experience it rarely lasts
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> THE ONLY THING WITH THAT IS YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> if sister told you to hold on, then come back, she's not here.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Only if you like a lot of sex.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> But some guys cover it up by marrying women.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> now that i answered it im not so bored any more... hey thanx!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> I'm having a Napolean Dynamite moment... umm... you could do as pedro does and make her a cake(?)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> get to know him drop hints that u like then u never know he might ask u out
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> the shy ones may just stare at you because they are scared to do anything else.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> he says d sweetest things 2me n abt me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> and feelings (love included) come and go.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> ;^) Seriously, I think it's like that because they don't know who or what they want.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> get to know him drop hints that u like then u never know he might ask u out
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> he says d sweetest things 2me n abt me.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> and feelings (love included) come and go.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> ;^) Seriously, I think it's like that because they don't know who or what they want.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_15> HAS ANYONE EVER TOLD YOU THAT YOU ARE A FREAKIN LOSER?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> i think you should stop eating them
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> i have been through this before and the only thing that seems to work is kindness.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Ask him straight up dont hesitate.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> What is it that I am not doing or shouldn't be doing.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> First of all is she the one for u, then u shouldn't worry about being embarrased.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Nobody should be anybodys punching bag it is just wrong.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I have heard that brunette is just Latin for blonde wanna be  :-p
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> of course it's possible  have fun
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> They always want the bad boys.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> ANYONE who says .... hi, is girl and who says hello is woman.... JUST OBSERVE....
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> hmmm...june 2006.  sounds like he needs to graduate from somewhere, perhaps?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> She was not the One  Why?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> I have 3 different friends, neither 1 of them know one another.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> If you're interested only in sex, then how about not marrying anyone?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> ask her for a date and she'll go with 'ya!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_10> IF THEY DONT UNDERSTAND, GIVE THEM TIME.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> (GOOD AND BAD) Like being married there is good and bad.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> Its col but of course i never ask guys out...To many of them ask ME out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> He hasnt told her because he wants to bang you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> if your kids grow up around that it makes them more likely to turn out that way!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> i'm 19 and still looking for a man that is the true!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> you only have one life 2live so live.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> your kids will grow up and think this is okay and its not.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> When we got married i weighed 98lbs now I weigh 140.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> (man do i miss it, can you tell???)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I do not see what's wrong with you looking at a another woman and saying oh she looks nice.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> THAT DEPENDS ON WHAT TYPE OF GUY HE IS BUT BOTH I GUESS
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I really like the girl so I want it to be cute.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> YOUR ACTIONS WILL KEEP YOU OUT OF TROUBLE AND ON THE RIGHT PATH.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> remember you are a helper love on him and encourage him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> Of course men want that, (whats wrong with you?)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> i am very sorry to say, but i think he likes her!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Have you ever done anything to her to make her not lke you?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> i going to wait tell after i am married
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> So take the time to look inward and then go get him!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> it was weird...i was surprised and like...wait people LIKE this??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well yeah if you tell her and shes normal herself shes sure to drop ya!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> you can flirt with him sometimes when you hang out, but don't overdo it.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Funny stuff ;)  BTW theres nothing wrong with what youre doing, just be honest with him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> I know that dating a guy is soo wrong!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> meanwhile warm up on some older ladies (those that are 5-10 years older).
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> I THINK MANY PEOPLE GET LUST CONFUSED W/ LOVE.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> yes if he or she is ugly, or drunk.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> if you started with nothing together, a pre nup would be a slap in the face.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Just show him that u are there for him and show him your love gradually.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> I don't know EVERYTHING about my wife's past.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> At least its better than having four husbands!
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_30> because they what toget some of that sexy thing
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> And, I don't mind staring at some men, either.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> talk about the postive and negative
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> R u serious.....wonder how many people would jump at this question ?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> YES, & IT SHOWS U HAVE GOOD TASTE!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> There are just too many questions...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> Strange thing, HE MARRIED HER, and she him.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> IT'S NOT REALLY THAT THEY DON'T KNOW IT'S JUST THAT THEY ARE CONFUSED.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> preying on young girls is NEVER acceptable.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_25> please, do yourself a favor and leave!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> What ever happened to being a real MAN which is what you need!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> to be able to spend time with you .
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> Your defensive attitude says it all...YOUR TOO YOUNG!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Take his hand in yours ... and ask him out!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> * lust at first sight, yes.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> he would have to pay alimony for the rest of her life or until she gets remarried.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i feel like i can do better on my own.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> sometimes he just does sex in bathrooms and other seedy places and she never knows.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> That means that if one spouse is caught cheating, the other gets EVERYTHING and he gets screwed.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> SAY WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO OUT FOR A CUP OF COFFEE SOMETIME?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> yes but it should be kept for marraige only!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> One thing with blue, is that there aren't many blue flowers.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> This guy sounds like it, too.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> girls like guys with skills   ex:  handy man , bowstaff, personality.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> As long as sex has to be thought about (Does he like it?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> I love my boyfriend to death.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> :) lol, I hope this sheds some light on the subject.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_35> If you left her i dont think shell want you back
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Now I see why it's best to wait.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> THIS IS AN EASY ONE AND I THINK MOST OF YOU ARE WRONG.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> being 18 is a hard time.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> Some lubrication (KY JElly) and a lot of foreplay.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> and wait for the right single guy.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> and if she says no ask her questions to why.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> 1- You should be good guy outside and inside.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> also you should tell the police
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> if possible the woman should just seperate for a while.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Great question, but the answer is 'not as many as I do' :)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> OK...guys are typically bad at gettting the subtle hints.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> just the thought of it makes me sick.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> jealousy can turn into abuse very fast...be careful
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> CAUSE SHE WOULD SAY SOMETHING TO YOU!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> my bf is just like that its so weird over protecteing
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> & YEAH HE LIKES U IF HE BUGS U LIKE CRAZY!!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> Best man I've ever had and plan on keeping him forever!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> then i tried to pursue him again and he pulled away once more.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> like to xchange photos or the tel no first?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> Hey you guys are in love.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> boys start after youve done it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> also, they wouldn't get used to the life style.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> Currency: Indian rupee (INR) - US$ 1  = INR 46.13 (July 2004).
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> I sure as hell wouldn't want somebody like you around....  Jesus!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> You're cheating on him with your boyfriend!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> I think of sex a lot.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> guys r jerks but they would do that so they can get into girls pants.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> do you know how it is for a kid to know their mom is getting abused?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Boy friends and girl friends come and go... don't let your freindships go because of some lame guy.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_25> BET ON PAPER CHITS.... who wins.... go for him.... almost everyone man is like other....
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> i think you should get a cool new style
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> If not on your honeymoon why would you the day after, or ever?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> I give it two thumbs up.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Think about all the thing that yo are good at and go have fun with some friends.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> we have one financial crisis after another.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> in my case.. its a she any i'd definitely go back to her cu I STILL LUV HER.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Keep yourself busy and stop thinking about when he's gonna call.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> im asking this question, to find a toll about how many girls actually fake it and why.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> yeah, but hey it it gives the other 40% of us something to laugh at
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Maybe you just don't feel ready yet.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Nathan (nā'thən) , in the Bible.
<NbChars_250> <LevSim_30> the best way to dump a girl is to be honest
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> ;) Let us know what happened!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> but the saying if you love something let it go if it comes by then its for real.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> but 5 months doen't really matter
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> If you dont love her anymore then tell her and dont hurt her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> ya its right along the vane on the underside of tere penis.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> sounds fake i knw but i want 2knw wat 2 do.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> I like whatever makes me happy and keeps me content  :-)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> a lot of times women think well i will just go find a man and show him.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> he is so cute...and only 16!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> but milk your mom and dad for what it is worth
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> generally because man came first and woman came from man so man has the desire first
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> hey you still young its a new year maybe luck will strike.good luck
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> Some people can just cut loose and ask whatever they want because you don't know who they are.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> She didn't even know that I gave it to him until last night!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> i sure hope ther are no children involved!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> I told my best friend and she got mad and we didn't hang out for 2 months.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> probably some guy who doesn't broadcast it
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Just don't go buying it with their money, or buying something really expensive that they'll never use.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> What you see is what you get ladies.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> You aren't kissing the right women ;)
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> Thanks for shining a light on my own life for me!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> surround yourself with guy-friends: guys that respect you and that your comfortable with.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> man if she says no who cares there is better looking woman in the see
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> it would take time to 4get things, though...he does it the 2nd time & bam!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> Wow...there's alot of conservative people around here.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> Good luck I agree with cig.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> !hahahahaha now wut u gonna do!?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Find a close friend dat might tell u something about some of ur downsides...pl.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> LIES only hurt and they will ALWAYS come back to bite you in the butt.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> as long as you love him it's alright.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> or it could be a band
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> Honey, I went to the doctor and I have (insert name of STD here).
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_25> my ex cheated so we are broken up.
<NbChars_320> <LevSim_20> damn woman, ur 33 n u look my age?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> i didn't mean to go out with him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> And oh my God, why would you stay with some married loser anyway.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Instead of hanging out with them, now you hang out with your special someone, yes?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Girls don't usually get mad, they get even.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> So be it...she needs a new wardrobe?
<NbChars_260> <LevSim_25> She's always there to check you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> And you think you got it from him?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> If she cares for you family and friends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> Every time I even thinks she wants to move up a notch though, I just lock up.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> Hey I am HOT ........try me !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Just talk to her and treat her like anybody else.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Depends on what you're buying... probably.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> We used to do that, why don't we do that anymore?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> i'm a hot man-- will that work for you??
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> I'm not shy around her any other time, so why then?
<NbChars_420> <LevSim_20> I'm a girl ask me more.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_20> damn lucky 18 year old bastard.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> love hurts because you know if you lost that person, you'd be crushed.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Why not me just e-mail me at sexyniceeyes_15@yahoo
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> Believe me, you don't- you won't for years and years.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> u don't no wat this guy is like.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> does it really matter to you?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> And you will hit tough times.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> soon..if you want..and late if u aren't interested!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> If your a man it's different.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> what did you do to lose her?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> She doesn't hate you, she is just annoyed.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> time and experience things with them
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> when your desires are not fulfilled then this hurts.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> If she could do what your mom can do for you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> don't be stupid and don't start dating!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> I actually really like this guy.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> I gotta be honest, you know!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> after that its really a combonation of looks and personality.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> make her feel important and special
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_10> HOW DOES A RELATIONSHIP GO FROM BEING HOT AND HEAVY TO NO SPARKS AT ALL.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> e-mail me so we can hook nup with fine girls on here
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> yea the truth hurts but he will eventually get over.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> my boyfriend and i are having some problems.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_30> who do i chose its so hard.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> the why did they ever break up golden couple:  Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> you can't live together and still go to highschool?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_10> YES SIZE DOES MATTER EVEN THOUGH ITS JSUT ONE FACTOR OF MAKING THA WHOLE EXPEIRENCE PLEASURABLE!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> my best friend's a guy, weve been best friends since we were 2!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> i just hope hes not bigger than you are!!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> So, bottom line, no -- it would not bother me in the least.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> thats a clear sign to break up.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> two things help me, i go out running to clear my head or theres always beer.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> make a billion dollars in the movies and ask her
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> i am 13 and there is this really nice girl that just moved here about 4 days ago.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> yeah ,but then I ignore Salma Hayek's lawyers who constantly threating me with a RO, muahahahha
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_30> ask her the worst thing she can say is no
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> Normally, women do not buy men gifts at all.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> Believe me, everytime you go back to a lost boyfriend it only gets worse and worse.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_50> give him a box of chocolate
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> then you should say one for you one for me one for you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> your still too young to date i'm not going to date till i'm 18!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> All you have to do is touch a guy and hes aroused... lol just joking
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> HELP is wright hide the kids.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> do whatever he wants, especially in bed, whenever he wants to
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> he turned out to be a jerk.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> You DO NOT KNOW THIS GUY HE MIGHT BE ARMED DO NOT MEET HIM.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> You might be dump if you make yourself so cheap.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> Dumb question but I just thought I'd get people opinions :o) Thanks.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> it took u 16 yrs to find out what kind of person her really was.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> I am 13 and know what I am doing!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> if you are a girl just be friendly n social then you'll   have lots of friends.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> Should I give it a chance or end it now?
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> Believe me im not gay i have a boyfriend just relax girl and be yourself allright?
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> this will make you a easier person to hang out with and you will have some friends.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> dont drag a relationship and make him think you love him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> he will give you one .
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> (Not to mention she typed all in caps, and it was one big run-on sentence...sheesh)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> i would tell him eye to eye.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> 13 is way too early to date.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Maybe the guy that is mean to you likes you!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> HOW CAN YOU LOVE SOMEONE, WHEN YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ANY OF THEIR INNER CHARACTERISTICS (PERSONALITY)?
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_45> well is your bf gay or fat?
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_25> Or just suck it up and hope they break up.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> JUST THE DECEPTION ALONE IS WRONG.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> First of all...if all he's doing is staring, that's not stalking.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> y wud u want a friend u dont no?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> If so all Puerto Rican men would be taken!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> you deserve better, and snooping isn't as bad as what she did... BY FAR!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> why can't girls buy the stuff they want with thier own money?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> in a relationship, one person is always chasing...if u dont chase her, she will come running
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> intelligent,even, along with her 3 siblings.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_30> Dump him, and find a real man!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> i would love to know too...   Maybe twice?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> tell me a way to get her to stop this madness!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> I'm in love with my boss and he's married.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Laugh at your jokes, listen to your tough day at work stories?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> wat is the sexiest way to masturbrate?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> He is an adult at 18 (by law) and you are a minor at 15 (by law)!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> love is blind, so who cares about race.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> i just want to know !!!!!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> I agree he is the hottest!!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> i used to but no ever really responds beyond the key board they are all afraid
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> he if an other guys going for her let them be.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> question is who doesnt like him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Thing is that I don't like him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if not one time you will have to let him go.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> well, you got that right, try switching to the other hand,
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Some of my best friends are men.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> Is that what you really want?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> If they want it again then BAMB they call sooner than later.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> maybe he does like you i mean my friend ended up going out with a guy she completely hates.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> As for when to take it off... never!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> this don't sound good at all.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> DON'T LISTEN TO GIRLS...THEY'RE SO DRAMATIC.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> But I want thing back the way they were and so do they.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> chance are, your friends are just jealous 'cause this guy is crazy over you.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> or should i have a good argument because this stuff should have never have happened..??
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> with knowing this info your halfway there.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> go get a life men u r sick
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> just wondering i really doubt it though
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> LOVE IS SO MUCH MORE THAN OUTTER APPEARANCES.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> aint even no question about it CHRIS BROWN!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> i couldnt understand why bcuz he said he loved me.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> and set ground rules for what is and is not allowed before you ever start out.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Then you start exersising like crazy, dieting and all that good stuff.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> normal..dont worry about it..just stare at other men
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> I can't believe she did not have sex with anybody either!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> UH....different for everyone..red, yellow, blue, green, black, purple, yellow, pink....
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> go on and enjoy the greatest thing on earth!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> your first mistake was telling her you liked her when she had a bf.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_45> i think you should tell her.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> would you nag and say stupid things with her/him?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Do you always let her pick the movie and the restaurant?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> I laughed my ass off for 10 minutes when I read this question
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> Why not both pink and blue?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Some girls just play hard to get because they know how weak you guys can get.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Even if he is, who cares?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> try to let her know that u r still alone and waiting for her
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> then once you get off of the phone listen to the radio or put on your favorite cd.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> NONE...don't do out side your race...it should be a crime...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> I mean it all depends on what they look like.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> so older guys and younger girls balance out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> they want you to stop listening to the crap you listen to
<NbChars_40> <LevSim_35> Butt juice HAHAHA...on that note I'm going to sleep
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Well if you don't and found out he is what you wanted will you be kicking yourself later ?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> i'm looling for him to get his e-mail
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> yes it happens a lot ot people
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> If you can't be wit the one you want  love the one your wit
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> simple .... get her phone no and call....
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> I believe that once a cheater, always a cheater.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> it's totally cool to let a      make a move!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Will my friends think I'm an idiot for liking her?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> I'm not attic cat but we can be friends!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> because its a womans job to complain and a mans job to fix things.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> spend the of rest your life reminding him and others what they lost n wish they had.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> your not going to get over not trusting him completely.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> And he's actually talking about working things out?NO IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> I liked her but she did not like me.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> even doe he doesnt want anyone to know about us i still love him.rember im only 13.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Boys are just aiting for this moment
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> find someone who can make you happy too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> my personal favorite: hey baby, we'll be having sex later tonight, you might as well be there.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> the answer  could be a million things
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Just like Sarah said, does he make you happy?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> I HAVE REALLY FALLEN IN TRUE LOVE .
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> Love's always real, rest is just infatuation.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> drop a peanut in her boobs and say, Oops, there go's my dinner...can i buy yours?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> not to mention you would probably hate the last name anyways.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> Who put that crap in your head.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> Fantasies are just that - fantasies.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> eg..eye contact etc etc if yes jst ask
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> give it a little time, if its a fresh breakup, before you persue this guy.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> visit any person from opposite sex .... at lonely place.... and try.... may be you learn....!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> for the same reason guys tease girls when they like them
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> what would your kids do with out you and what would they be exposed to with out you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> cause they are full or someone dosent want you in there
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_25> find some guy you like, flirt, sit on his lap.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> i don't thing there is love at first sight.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> like when trying to ask her out or like making her think you are interested in her
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> I gave this boy named Clayton a HUGE bar of chocolate for Christmas, (I even wrapped it!)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> save yourself please, don't do it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> ....meaning that the vagina looses its strengh and becomes rather loose and men find it difficult to enjoy intercourse?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> keep things the way they are now, yea?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> I guess the easiest way would be to ask why is he hangs around you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Auctions and then changed my mind and I no longer want it.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> Even at his age, he STILL looks sexy as all hell.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> they feel like they are the king (most off the time!!!)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> what a hypocritical thing to say.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> You know that you have to ask out girls....
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> well it depends on why she left you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> well, if he gay or bi-curious, tell him .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> athletic guys as in average joe build.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> yeah did that and it was not great.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Did he try to make it up to you?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> will he eventually have it happen again?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> if you have to ask the question is he having an affair.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> (No, really, don't pick me...I'm fat, ugly & married with 2 kids).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Well I'm a shy guy so I know all about this.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> get a life and be patient for things in their right time.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_55> It is not bad at all!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> ....Because men say you are a nice girl, and you are not!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> not very good sex but hey you broke the plain so its sex just the same
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> Oh yeah and it's two not to...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> 18... doesnt make any sence though I was waiting for the right one and he wasnt it either.....
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> only guys they see that has popularity, looks, or money.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> It depends I guess, Im a girl, but love can make people do crazy things.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> i am a much different person than i was with him.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> NO IT DOES NOT  think with your head, not your heart.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> I KNOW SOMEONE WHO WAS SWIMMING IN THE OCEAN WITH HER WEDDING RINGS ON AND THE DIAMOND FELL OUT.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> A guy wouldn't think much of 140lbs.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> OK...this might sound harsh, but it is not all women, just the ones that you pick.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> I just need some advice I guess...
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> No guy is worth having sex with to keep - especially when you're 15.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> if she is threatining you w/ something, tell!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> 2 answers for the question, he might be thinking of you or he don't....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Especially if you have no fricken friends left to hang out with because they're all married.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> dude, no no no no no
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> It's not the meat...it's the motion!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> tell him whats on your mind.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> and it is sex that would make love spicier.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> It wouldn't be the same, and you really wouldn't like it.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> i need all the help i can get!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> yes you should its hard to find a guy that will say that out right!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> If you love your husband help him understand what you need and what u like.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_20> YOU'RE A GAME TO HIM, AND IF YOU MOVE ON TO SOMEONE ELSE HE'S LOST THE GAME.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> no if your a girl yes if your a boy
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> SO STOP CALLING HIM AND WATCH HE CALL YOU AND MAKE UP A LIE FOR NOT CALLING YOU.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> be honest and tell him nicely what u think, and tell him the truth.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> I try to act like I'm happy but I kinda feel hurt and betrayed...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> NOW THAT I END UO MARRIES THE MOST PREFCIT MAN IN THE WORLD
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> Theres ways to Spice things up.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> I care for this woman but don't really want a relationship with her.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> if you ever let him know how you feel and hope he feels ya back!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> find a better guy no matter how hot he is.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> michael vartan, definitely --- ohh such a hottie!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> I don't think it's bad or good...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> if you truly want to be a friend, say no way!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> I just like him as a friend.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Personally, I don't really think sex gets you anywhere with guys, they just want some.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> You know the saying, Once a THEIF always a THEIF.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_60> just go up to him and ask
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> You just have to learn to except the change or don't.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> tell him how u feel duhhh
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_20> i mean there r so many ppl in this world.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> they say they're not, but some pictures of them seem pretty snug and cozy...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> some roses and a heart and tell him that u love him
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> when you're done with all that crying, pick yourself up & meet different people,have fun!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> I really didn't believe her but then Nickleback dropped her off at my house.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> But just like the other guy said, guys don't like girls playing hard to get.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_50> If that don't work, then dump him & move on.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Pick your nose and flick the boogers at her.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Now, you've conquered, you've learn much, the good, the bad, the ugly, the dumb, etc.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> U will know WHEN you two have that FIRE in your EYEs.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Y act a way that is gonna make u unhappy just to impress a guy.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> very difficult to forget first love
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> the best revenge is to not look pathetic and be strong.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> theres this grl, n im stuck on her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> you have to go w/ your heart and be honest
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> 60% is an underestimate... probably more like 85%!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> let me know what you think!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> in because i wanted to see how people would react.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> wants to have it again............easy to read men.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> And, the real question then becomes why do I pick women who cheat?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> something that show you love them
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> Wait a while so your mixed feelings subside, but if they don't maybe you should just stay friends.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> Go do fun things he would like.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> it can to certian people...thats what a foot fetish is...
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> Hell no, he's only 3 years old.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> being gay is often a sad lonely thing.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> gurl u aint no lesbian u just cant live without your x-bf so dont worry everytins gonna be alright
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> no but if you find one can you find one for me ?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> because life's 2 unfair 2 get a hottie that's nice
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> if there are no kids around... any where!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> yes i made it up and I AM NOT A LIAR!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Maybe she is tring to make you jelous.!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> This is what I did for my guy friends: I cooked for them!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> but its against the law in some states.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> uh...I wouldnt think so...ashley's older than zac by like...2 years though...I dont think they ever will date...IMO
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> and after all that you wont have to worry about getting a girl to like you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Just because men and women can and do become attracted to each other, doesn't mean they all do!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> I've french kiss a lot of women.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> This could also be a gang thing...
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> it's not the best idea though...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> I don't know does he love me?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> you've caught him TWICE don't u think that's enough?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> My boyfriend is drop dead sexy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> find the answer and then you will realy now what to do sory for my english

<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> and answer peoples Q. like urs.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Read the book (I kissed Dating Good Bye)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> But not a big kiss, maybe just a peck.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> She is probably suffering from some sort of phsycological disorder that should be addressed SOON!!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> the louder the better b/c they'll actualy talk to u first instead of us guys making the first move.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> thanks for ur time to read this :)
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> tell him to leave you alone forever!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> SO I SIT DOWN AND WROTE EVRY THING I LOVED ABOUT HIM DOWN.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> we had been friends for about 4 years and i had dated his bestfriend for that 4 years.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> tell a friend then ask that girl.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> do things that u will normally NEVER think of doing.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> i bet there are lots of things that she eats that you hate, right??
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Hugs...If i was there with you, i would demonstrate, ha ha ha.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> Oh, and buy her gift certificates to Victoria's Secret ;)
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> and you are pretty sure you feel the same way about both people.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> start by trying to just meet people.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> If he cheated on you, why would you want to stay with him???
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> The type of guy who doesn't buy you gifts .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> they have no respect for their father at all!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> Wait,I say wait on the Lord.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> i madeout w/ her lik 4 months ago.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> but think about this, there's a reason that she broke up with him.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> DO NOT WEAR YOUR PLATINUM AND DIAMONDS IN THE OCEAN OR ANY OTHER BODY OF WATER BESIDES THE SHOWER!!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> First of all, if you're asking a guy, the answer is 'There is NO sexy way!'
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> just for all teens teens games
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> titty flick 'em and don't be shy about it
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> well not really i mean ur girlfriend is going to be with you
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Can't say that I still do cuz I am happily married.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> But, if you are a virgin when you get married how would you know???
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Honey almost eveyone has that what if person in thier life.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> He seems to be nice, but let's face it, I DON'T KNOW HIM!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> be realistic about who u are looking for in a date.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> u can e-mail me with any porbs u have people call me the broken heart fixer.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> go out and work on you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Cause the women their age (dont want them)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Love doesn't mean sex nor does it mean a relationship it just is...
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> Well I am gay as well and looking but am not in real good shape.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> Besides, who does he go home with at the end of date?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> get him something nice maybe a shirt or find something that he loves
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> Some guys because they want something from you like some ass.
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_30> bushmaster is right, plus he is playing
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> Date someone she knows, like her father!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Just don't do it over the phone...that's the way cowards do it
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> because your wrapped up in your self and have no room for any thing else.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> doesnt mean they are cheating could be they have been cheated on and just have no trust.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> I mean, what if you end up getting pregnant while you're still in school.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> flash him some boobie he will notice you then.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> I mean, who's gonna be MOM and who's gonna be DAD ?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> because your wrapped up in your self and have no room for any thing else.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> doesnt mean they are cheating could be they have been cheated on and just have no trust.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> I mean, what if you end up getting pregnant while you're still in school.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> flash him some boobie he will notice you then.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> I mean, who's gonna be MOM and who's gonna be DAD ?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> it is called something different when you are a guy addicted to sex.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> hey man you dont need a girlfriend, girls have cooties and are evil, thats what my momma told me
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Girls that you can TAKE, you don't want.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> that you don't know how to make yourself happy.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> maybe its because you place them on a pedastal... you shouldn't be worshipping them if they are ignoring you!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> i don't know why but yes to your question.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> i do not talk to my ex just because he is not part of my life anymore.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> fumble their words, seem to be around alot
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> I'm good looking, I'm a good g/f.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> If you have to ask, then it's time to leave.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> i dont think that that is true.some people dont act like their parents at all.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> what matters is how you work it.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_30> move on..friends even on this line!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> I know he likes me because he told me and he is kinda cute
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> of course u should like him if u love him
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> if you are happy together it shouldn't matter if you are married.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> just tell him and only once
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> even if had one i wouldnt die for her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> then u start out slow like dinner and a movie.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Maybe you can find the guy of your dreams  there!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> if u arent rlly related, u should go 4 it!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> (Btw... Coffee for them, not you!)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> As soon as you do....its over.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_10> YOU COULD HAVE A FRIEND FOLLOW HIM OR YOU COULD FOLLOW HIM YOURSELF.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> ive been with this girl for a year and a half and my friends hate her
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> (little things are important to getting lots of friends) 5.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> Umm why don't women hate arguements.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> The other asians look at me like I'm a traitor :).
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> i'd say about 20%   i've never done it but my friend swears it's the best
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> You are too young to be a parent!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> some guys are rough some guys are tough!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> If u don't no him, end it now.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> red red wine) might do U some good to help U relax.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> however you manage it i wish you the best of luck
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> that was myself 5 years ago.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> or a 35 year old women have sex with ur 18 year old boy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> if he smiles back he probably does like you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> and then I found out that he gave it to my best friend.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> i do to that is cool men
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> and i have seen gay guy marry a women just because he was in love with her!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> funny you would ask that bcuz i just had the same prob wit ma ex bf.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> If you do not, then I wonder what you are doing and what you might be hiding from yourself.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> dont worship the ground they walk on, first of all.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> but thats just me...you may have your own views
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> (This was so much easier when I was a teen)
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> If you like wine, going to to Napa.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> cos we love you abd youre stupid question
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_25> becz u are 1 of them lolz
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> Do keep on hanging out with him, though.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> it depends on the girl,she might want to kiss you on the first date.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> I wouldnt Want To Go out With Some Dumb ass Pretty Boy.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> I agree with you 100%- YOU WILL NEVER KNOW THE DIFFERENCE!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> or do we get the excuse .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> But then I experienced it for myself...
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> yes they are look on myspace
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> I BELIEVE IN LUST @ FIRST SIGHT.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> if the guy is controlling dont if he is very leaniant and shy then do
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> I love every min of it.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> But if he is treating you like s***, get out.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> internet ,like chatrooms,its a good place to meet all kinds of women.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> When u think u love someone at an early age.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> WHEN THEY LOOK U IN THE EYE OR SMILE WHEN U SMILE
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> i dont want u wearing that or doin this.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> so hang in there, dont get in a hurry.

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> :) <3 :) the above is you and your hubby!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> trust me i've done it more than enough times 2 know
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> You should ask a gay person if gay's will marry women
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> LOOK AT 2ND CORTHINANS IN THE BIBLE; ITS DEFINES IT SOOO NICE
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> I may be married but still turn my head walking down the street once in awhile.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> i dont like to kiss on first dates.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> Didn't know we had one LOL
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Depending on if you a son and daughter.

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i'm still wanting to get with a person right now.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> imean when u donot stay with a uncle but u miss yoyur dad,sisters andu dont reallyfeel at home
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> just friends are acquaintances...frnds are sumthin more.....ur heart will tell u the diff
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> (Just remember to save a little $ for your STD testing afterwards!)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> sounds like drama....why don't you leave him alone until he's situation is resolved?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> start a fight and then have some make-up sex
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> well...i'm in the same situation (opposite gender tho.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> i come and go as i please and do not answer to anyone.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> as long as you both like each other..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> some people love the sight of money they say its great, but that doesnt mean i say that too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> There is nothing wrong with having sex with someone that u used 2 b n a relationship with.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> and then the christmas thing and didnt spend newyears with her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Don't have sex with him anymore whether he gets mad or not.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> you don't need him to make you feel special, yourself are special to you!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> ur supposed to wipe the cum off ur eyes IDIOT!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> don't kiss on the first date, it might make you seem desperate.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_15> YES, IF U LUV THEM VERY MUCH,AND IF THE PERSON LUVZ U 2.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> i had a c-section, so am not sure.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> It really is a waste of time to fake it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> ask her to take a chance on you !
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Is it bcoz of good sex?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> yes yes yes look at them this is them when they get older
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> but flowers i dont know it would be flattering, but some might not be as acceptable.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> unless u can live with the money you have then yes.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> i dont like any of them but kinda stuck since i work weird hours and usually late any how.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> of course because having a full moon in sight without licking honey seems to be absurd
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> it is for your own good)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> i meet a guy recently n it seems 2gud 2b true??
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> mention how bad it is, and how you now hate that guy.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> find a new man and move on..he has
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Then if them answers are no then maybe your shy.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> try to be out and about but don't settle for less.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> And show them that u are wise and funny.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> That's how it should be......people should be friends.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> You do not believe a HUMAN can live 5 yrs without sex??????
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> i would pass her a note at the end/middle of class.i have done it it works !!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> old and i m born on 23.07.1984
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> women loves receiving gift period .
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> If you've got kids... it's cheaper to keep her... otherwise... yeah.. leave her
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> it would depend a lot on how old this boy is
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> she is really pretty but we exchanged christmas gifts and she really like the one i got for her
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> girls tease boys to much because they don't have another choice do.they can't leave there love inside them
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> DO NOT lay it on thick.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> hapeen to one out of million
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> a lot of cold showeres and dont give in to urges right away get a little attitude
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> Don't worry too much, someone will go out with you, just wait a little longer.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> KEEP YOURSELF BUSY AND IF ANYTHING TRY TO HAVE SEX AND GO OUT.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> Yeah, dude you got the wrong woman.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Every little thing i do is about this guy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> I have a friend who met his wife on a dating site...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Don't knock it till you try it and it's only kinky the first time.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> Why should he break up with her?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> He's got her on one side and you willing to wait for him on the other.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Or just invite him to a party!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Another way is putting your panties in their pocket...um, that works also
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> Why should he break up with her?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Or just invite him to a party!
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_25> Another way is putting your panties in their pocket...um, that works also
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> wuz up same place u from
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> (not sexualy)  youll see it in his eyes when he looks at you
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> Right now Guys are really my big dissapointment.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> What if u and him get back together he break up with u again?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> u should tell her how u feel
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> Can you really DATE over the internet??
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> go to clubs hang out what ever just be around people and be friendly.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> I dont think he does we never cliked.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> i think that you should wait a while after your breakup then tell him your feeling!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> im curious how men describe love.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> go up to random guys and flash them... eventually some geek will be intregeed!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> He saved me a grip on linen, lol!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> no.. but if you have you probably have some gastro problems
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> They are so strict and I honestly don't really like them.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> Try to look for around urself.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> and the rest is up to u
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> which if u r in that case get over it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> no one will ever control me again.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> If he really loves u, then trust him.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Believe me I can...  Anyways here are some questions for you...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> i kinda do but then i kinda dont
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> If your getting married in the spring go with pastels of blue and pink and green and yellow.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> blackmailing girls into dating you doesn't work.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Don't look for somebody and she will come....
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> has he ever told u in those 16 yrs.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> When I go out with my married friends, I feel so out of place and lonely.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> IT'S ALL ABOUT WHO'S INVOLVED IN THE FUN...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Go out with your best female friend Bff
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Well I am good with communicating with myself but otherwise I suck at everything else!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> But seriously I dont know any nathan... =)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> I FOUND I WAS JUST REPLACING SOMEONE I CAN'T SO.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> e-mail me at aailopez@sbcglobal.net hey tell me were you live.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> And sex leads to babies and std's.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> and it makes her look hot if she has curves!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> it's more like fate .. go for what ur heart leads u to ..
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> !..Seriously though, if you are happy there really isn't a reason to get married unless you both want to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Sittin on his lap, smack him on the butt.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> THANKS FOR ANY HELP - BODMOD
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> After 9 years, you two are still having great sex 3 times/week?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> ummmmmm......... probably Paris Hilton or Pamela Anderson
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_30> In love is not one sided.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> tru luv lasts forever and its pretty rare....
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_45> never forget it is your choice your life your happiness

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> yes i can be your friend because im iranian but im not in iran
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> They want your body and your love!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Like Ginger said when u're smart and successful u can hav anything u want(almost anything)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> This will give her time to get used to it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> if they do go out with you now .
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> i think if you like potatoes that is okay, she doesn't have to like them too.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> u can read more in the link , and search in yahoo!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> caz the older woman know that they are scum.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> it all depends on how u think
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> or write a heart felt letter to her
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Be careful when u say that u love your best friend.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> well it all depends if she would understand or not.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> when u r 18 u become an adult......act like un and be more responsible.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_25> ; questions that he NEVER asks.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> WHATEVER YOU DO DON'T judge him for what is said!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> i raped a girl and went to prison for 10 years.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> now dont get me wrong if there is both love (not lust) and committment then go for it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> sounds like you better stick w/ makin love to urself :-P
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> If it were just me, hell no.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> anyways on the sight she claims that she and zac are dating.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Its gotta be at the right moment and stuff.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> well, I'm only 18 but if you aren't getting some from anyone else, sure...?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> cheat on him and see if he cares when you say, well you have been cheating too!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> * How do I use Yahoo!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> no, zac has his own girlfriend!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> i do i gots his ring tone
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> Life is hard enough on its own...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> My guy now, when I met him in H.S.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> Depends on your guy, he should make it good for you, if not, then you have the wrong guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> but, I do believe it now.. you'll see what I mean when you find the right one!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> Dont ever do anything to lose someones trust .
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> just ask him if he wants to do the nasty.. you should be good then...
<NbChars_250> <LevSim_30> Just enjoy being 17 & flirting!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> but, inevitably one or both of you will develop feelings for the other...then it all gets messy.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> it took a month of playing his gf against him and scheming and coniving.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Be yourself... and the best advice my mother always gave me... STOP LOOKING!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> Fame- Guys will pay money to see and buy more money to take a picture with her.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> then you look at yourself in the mirror and see how funny you look crying.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> Check out this photo of my wife!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> If you can't make the choice - don't.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_10> THERE IS NO MARRAIGE WITHOUT LOVE!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> Dude, you're just gonna have to ignore it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> your on yahoo sweety go look for it on here trust me they have it all
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> like it help my husband win me back.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> she must be you or one of your family members
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> I always hated when that happened.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> cause then if your smart you wouldn't wanna deal with them then!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> it doesn't hurt to tell us we're beatiful either!!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Don't pretend that you know things you don't.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Just becuse I have friends that are also girls does not mean I want to have sex with them.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> At least the women I know do : ).
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> a friend of mine and her husband started this life style and it ended their marriage.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> and it doesnt seem like that is ganna happen.... so now wat?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Just try to shut that out of your mind.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> NO BUT IF U FIND ONE MAKE SURE SHE'S HOT AND HORNY!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> thats illegal for the record if anything happens between you he can go to jail.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> Imagine how hurt she'd be if she heard it from somebody else?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> if she would then go ahead.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_35> Try to get him out of it
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> butt juice that is pretty funny it may be linked to some diareah??????
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> I vote arlenrthomas as best answer!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Or am I wrong c'mon people give me some answers!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> think bout it dont let him play mind games wth you
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> I hate women like that to.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> you true friends will want to see you happy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Just smile at them...they will wonder what you are thinking!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> God doesn't make any mistakes...  : )
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> u have more then enough time to plan u wedding ....
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> Most of the time, its probably ok.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Oh don't go there again, leave the door to that firmly shut and locked.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> i don't try to those things just happen.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> you will never now till you give it a try.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> love, because when you are in love with someone you will probably have sex with that person anyway
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> * love at first sight, no.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> I love out  movies and like sex  anytime
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> i think ur gil would whant u for the whole day u know go places,talk.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> show her you love your life, etc.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Maybe even take a friend with you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> drop her like a hot tater!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> It's just one part of your life that shouldn't take over the rest.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> yes there is  but soon or later the woman is going have to tell his husband
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> PEOPLE GET KILLED WHEN THEY GO AND MEET SOMEONE OFF THE INTERNET.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Thats the real reason guys are shy around some girls.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> I hear millions of girls say that their men treat them like crap .
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_35> hey not all guys r like that....i am not like that     cid
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> ENJOY YOURSELF BEFORE YOU GET SERIOUS AGAIN.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> She is catholic and she was unable to swear she didn't have sex
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> hey i m also 13 and dont have a bf email me
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> First u gotta think about why they dont like u.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> well that's kinda contradicting don't ya think, jk no you show them by the way you treat them.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> but one problem they constantly fought all the time.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> He gets jealous of petty stuff.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Heard it said it works wonders.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> time it takes a lot's of time.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> IF ITS BIG AND U DONT KNOW WAT U DOIN, THEN ITS JUST A WASTE!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> trust me.. wait on this one.. you will regret not doing so.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> yes it would be... thats strange..
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> he probaly scared you don't like him!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> and focus on the reason why you broke up..that should tell you if u have a chance..good luck
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> i have only talked to her once or twice.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Just listen and look at them.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> and even then it should b equal worship.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> your question is just as stupid as theres, what exactly did you want people to say back?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> girls say they love gifts but never use or take care of what you give them.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> it worked for me and its kinda fun if noones looking..........
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> And it's TOO young, not TO young.)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> please get out now and fast.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> (there are a few more, but thats the main one)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> yeah, the guy above me beat me to the point.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> SO THAT YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> age and looks are open, will reply to all who answer
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> You just gotta go for it.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> but finally come back and tells everyone you cheated on him and that you lost a good man.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> i dont think its possible to love two people the same way.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> If you need to ask, then no.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> once you are able to do that .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> and as for your daughter, she will be just as torn at 9 as she would be now.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> Because all of us are stupid =P, lol.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> get him a tee shirt or hat with his favorite team on it
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> things will all come together the way they are meant to in the end.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Try blasting You Can't Hurry Love .
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> But anyway, actions speak way louder than words.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> no guy is worth worship unless he is ur husband.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> Theres this guy in my grade and he practicly molests girls all the time!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> You might squash your chances if you wait for the guy!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> or, is he interested in sex only?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> & if it dosent, then its probly cuz u have found some1 better along the way.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> you need to tell him that you have guy friends and thats all they are.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> I like girls around 5 feet and around 100 lbs.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> First french kiss...I burped in his mouth.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Thats all every guy wants all day....give us a break, we're not just meat.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> phone, email etc... to me is weak, childish and it's so un-personal.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> I think Sidney Portea (SP) is hot.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> if shes got booty and you don't watch out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Does he buy you lots of gifts and flowers?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> I don't even know why he's in love with me in the first place!!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> Ask them questions about themselves.... ;-)
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> do repugnent things.. sleep with scank , make sure she knows!!....
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> at 14 but im guy and we are different we dont wait for the right one.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> Does he feel bad about forgetting?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Be nice about it and mature.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> if he calls you when he is having a bad day say deal with it you chose to leave.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Have sex with him if you really love him, not because youve heard black guys have big penises.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> IF it is just the sex you want then talk about any of the others u want to.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> he is not worth ruining your life for or doing stupid things for.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> It's just not men in general!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_45> Find out why she hates u first?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> i have 6 children and my partner love sex even more so i think it makes a difrents
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> i ill die for her 100 times.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> it  depends  on what   that  something  is  and  who  someone  iz.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> if u do love him no matter what just through it.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> As was said it's the what if guy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Don't worry, it will pass - and it will probably happen again.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> he just broke up with someone and i really want him back
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> my kids have a hard time with this.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> ....hmmm....telling without telling.....that's a controdictory statement.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> if she's really your best friend she'll eventually get over it.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> but he has higher standards than that!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> If I were you I'd keep things the way they are...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> A good honey moon is to go to Hawwii
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> learn how to make yourself happy .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> But if you want to live w/ your counsin Amy than you should :)
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> but they are human just the same as you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> i do want you as a friend but,also,i dont want my e-mail public
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> My sister's 21st birthday her man didn't do anything for her.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> but if the guy acts first, then definitly, but you should probably take it slow.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> if you really like her then its worth a shot.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> I'm young and I know a little about colors.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> maybe a grandpa with a girl nice nieces age would be odd.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> you need to leave him fast and take the kids.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> and the 'one' will come along.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> or do u just like to be weird that way...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> as long as he's legal - go for it......sex has no guilt if both sides enjoy it
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> (I think I spelled that wrong, oh well).
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> you've sure got a lot of answers...hey!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> nothing ............it will last for couple of weeks than you'll get over it!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> what's to stop him from abusing them?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> usually the girls are more mature then the boys at a young age.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> k, yeah, don't do that either.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> Im sorry to tell you like it is....i really am.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> i wanna go out with 2 different guys and they both love me and i love them to.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_15> I'M WITH THE OTHER GIRL YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T BE DOING IT BUT IT IS A PERSONAL DECISION.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> Can you give me some help?Thank!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> ANYTHING YOU DO THAT YOU HAVE TO HIDE FROM YOUR SPOUSE IS OF COURSE, WRONG.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> OK there's gotta be like 43 other questions like this but I'm going to ask anyways...
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_25> but was not used to my size.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_20> Can you give me some help?Thank!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> ANYTHING YOU DO THAT YOU HAVE TO HIDE FROM YOUR SPOUSE IS OF COURSE, WRONG.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> if she left you its probably not a good idea to try and get her back.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Girls fall out of love same reason guys do.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_20> or its simply means that SHE IS NOT IN LOVE WITH YOU ANY LONGER!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> If it takes a 15, or 30 mins thats ok. Let her take her time.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> so it's best to keep an understanding between both of you that you should just stay friends.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> And if i had a wife like that, i would be the happiest man in the world.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_15> TALK TO THEM AND LET THEM NO HOW U FEEL.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> It might not have been you anyways...Lady
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> What if my neighbors were in a same sex marriage?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> he will always want to sleep with her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> yonger women are sexier longer, duh
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> to me it is a buch of bull crap because i have a way of doing things intentionally.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> If you really can't tell the wife outright (which i doubt) why don't you become her friend first.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> If she smiles a lot when talking to you, she probably likes you :-)
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> im not saying play hard to get cuz that really doesnt work.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> men hate arguments when women find out he's cheating.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> so basically when ever u mature and know that life isn't just fun and games.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> go thru with it, of course.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> i have not found it yet but i hope to soon!!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> To be honest, I wouldn't at all.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I don't what to tell you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> a guy who just really doesn't care.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> They probably won't listen to you.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> no guy who doesn't like u or never will because he may b a player isn't worth anything......
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> A married man should not be looking for any other married woman (BESIDES HIS WOMAN) on the first place!.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> u should get urs at lane bryant.com my mom loves that store she wears plus size 2 good luck
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> well do ask yourself when you will get married!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> photos to compare the results with your case ...   hope i was useful
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> That first person who you loved and couldnt get enough of!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> its all in your head, males tend to hype them selves.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> but there is shame in one partner doing all the taking and no giving back
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> what do u mean.theres different ways.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> hormones, love.... a variety of reasons really
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> you should just let it go
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> No doubt he will say yes if you ask him that you like him.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> wrong a guy should ask u out
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Probably just some of the things that runs through his mind.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> a favorite sports item like a hat or shirt
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> and if you like him too dont tell him til you get your answer first.lol.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> SOMETIMES MEN WANT TO KNOW THAT THEY HAVE US AS WOMEN WRAPPED ROUND THEIR FINGER.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> This goes for us men, too!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> It cost big to get anything.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> don't they have so much lose?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> would any of you girls hook up with a masochistic dude?like into bondage and shit like that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> duh what good is a honey moon if u dont?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> first off dont worry about it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> If  you love someone you don't count.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Don't think of having sex with him.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> I don't think men hate arguments.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> be nice and caring but not too much though i hate it when people overwhelm you by attention
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> so if he isn't a butt ask him out.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> Use LOTS AND LOTS AND LOTS of Lubrication, and your fingers.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> if he ax yoo out then give him a chance to see if yur mixed feelings clear up
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> yes...it is a sad moment when you realize that u have to choose between 2 people.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Think about what it will be like 10 or 20 yrs.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> i think its best(even if the relationship doesn't work) if you let them find you
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> yes i would i love my b-f to death    he is my baby   i would die 4 him anyday
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> BE NICE TO HIM AND FROGET WHAT YOUR FRIENDS SAY.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> Yeah only if you are a romantic naive, dumb girl!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> now we're back together and happier then ever before :D !!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> email me if you have any problems wit dat
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> wow that was alot .... did you say all that in one breath
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> 3rd cousin or further then its fine otherwise, EEWW!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> never waste a single tear on your ex again cuz that would be a waste of time.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> THEN AGAIN HE MAY NOT NOTICE BECAUSE HES TOO BUSY LOOKING AT OTHER WOMEN..LEAVE THIS LOSER
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> What great answers, especially the one above me..Keep up the good work!!!guys!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> if anything send them to his house.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I'll tell you why they do it!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> you should not marry this new guy!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> but if u dont subscribe to one of em, I guess ur outta luck.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> ever hear the sayin....if they do it with you...they will do it to you
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> like others have said, quit giving him some, marriage should be more than a booty call.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> thats not right just be honest.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> if anyone could help i would really appreciate it
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> ITs never worked for me guys always seem to want more sooner or later.

<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> he broke up with me to go back to his ex gf.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> hope your life insurance is paid up
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I didn't think it was possible for a guy to be that sexy.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> that how u propose a girl if u r in his position
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> im looking to date or talk on line or in person
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if you truly love the person, then you would go throught with it
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> No way... what are you trying to teach your kids??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> First off, don't play hard, us guys hate it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> And if I want more my man can rise the occasion and give it to me once agian
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> it's ok if you still like him.... dont giv into her!

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> SO THEY PLAY THIS CHILDISH GAMES.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> I'm going out with a great girl now.

<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> its there way of getting your attention.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> love at first sight is like a fair tale.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> guys also don't know when girls like them.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> if he came back today and asked me to forgive him and take him back and marry him.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Unless you are a guy... then i guess you do something else (unless your into that)
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> seems a little rushed, espectially if you met online.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Some men do also and many women do not.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> i say some girls should not worship these type of guys or any guy.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> Also it helps to hit on the nice girls :)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> If she doesn't stop, then I don't know
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> i like chris brown and all my friends love him they would die 4 him....how crazy is that
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Because most of them don't have any real life friends.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> do you guys find women with defined biceps/triceps attractive?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> By the way, i have a lot of big black guys with average penises.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> He cannot handle money & lately bounced many checks!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> 1 because karma does comes back to bite you and especially now that you know about her relationship.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> sure just that one of yall has to be gay lol ;0)
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> Some guys can be totally jerks.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> Have her hit you over the head with it all the while yelling freak.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_20> glad i can be of some help!!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> But for me its freaking the same... Friends is FRIENDS...  FrIeNdS is always fRiEnDs...
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> I mean does anyone truely know?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> i think that guys like to be the one to make the move!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> All Day Long(just about).....Im thinking about it now :)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> wIVES SUBMIT TO YOUR HUSBANDS, HUSBANDS SUBMIT YOUR WIVES.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> IF U REALLY LOVE EACH OTHER U SHOULD TRY TO WORK IT OUT NO MATTER WHAT.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> No, I have seen women try to make that work, and it never does.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_10> RUBBISH DEAR DON'T YOU THINK IT MAKE ONE IRRESPONSIBLE AND CHEAP.THINK?
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> But those are only SOME girls!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> i guess whenn you're this interested to answer his question, though you don't know the answer,,,,,, sorry!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> picnics in the park are cheap and very romantic.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Just b urself, and like search ur feelingz, and respect urself.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> when we broke up i was devistated but he stuck by my side.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> She's a jerk and a loser.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> If he didn't, there'd be excuses no to have sex with you.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> And now to the rest of your issue...
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> emperors did and now they are praised so is it bad if i do
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_30> Im 17 n my bf is 20.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> As the fortun cooke said A best friend is one soul with two bodies
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> It seems like it takes alot for me to get in the mood.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> i dont think so but people have different opions.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> AND  THE ONLY WAY TO TELL THEM IS STRAIGHT UP.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> For lots of gay guys its a really hard thing to deal with.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_25> some times he is just jeluos and is hoging you
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> so many (Q's) so many (A's).
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> Do other people think shes cute and nice like I do?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> I AM MARRIED AND HAVE A 19 MONTH OLD DAUGHTER.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> Like, 'get rid of' get rid of?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> Go to yahoo personals .. they got lots of women that age on there.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> everyone knows she does this jokingly.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> they are cheating and just trying to point the finger at you because they are doing wrong.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Women bitch because men don't listen; and men don't listen because women bitch.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> I was in 6th grade and he even missed my graduation.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> YES IF U LOVE THEM VERY VERY MUCH
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> That person could just be very insecure, or not trust anybody you hang out with.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> bcoz we cant change anyone by arguments.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> If I was a guy, I would prefer C cup breast, small waist, hippy, and thick legs!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> bcoz i love her very much.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> tell her u want to talk to her email buddies cause u want to be apart of her life.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> make sure that ur best qualites r well polished & ur ready 2 shine when it finnaly does.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> If you still love him all you have to do is re-light ya'lls fire.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> but you might learn what his fault are and decided to you love him anyway.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> I want to be friends first.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> flowers would not be the best thing to send your man.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> since there are childen involved its a way awful thing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> boy would i go out with that pic in a heart beat.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> She's your ex... why do you care so much?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Chances are that they are very shallow and are not worth the time and day to go out with
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> it depends on if you really love the girl and if she really loves you back!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Or just going to a dance club/party and (slow) dancing.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> we can be friend if you want
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> i still lik her n i try 2 avoid her now .
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> this kid bugs me all the time and he doesn't like me
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Just trying to spare the guys feelings.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> If you love him it shouldnt matter.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> And thats what your doing .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> So she wants jasmine rice, let her eat the rice!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> you cant get her to stop.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> 1 if she doesnt kiss right away leave
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> hang out with her when you can, and maybe you guys will become closer and whatever happens happens.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> but there are things guys want to .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I work with this woman who is lazy and doesn't do her job.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> If you value your friendship with him that much DO NOT persue a relationship with him
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_10> I PERSONALLY THINK THAT IF A WOMAN IS IN THAT SITUATION SHE SHOULD GET OUT!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> If he get's bent over you not answering the phone...He needs to check himself.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> They may all love and respect you,but make no mistake about it,THEY ALL WANNA DO YOU!!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> no lies, no games, and safe sex.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> Like I said I know from my own experances with women.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> You can't, it's in human nature
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> does he have a nice friend , fuck him and videotape it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> She takes her time and watches me work and it drives me crazy.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> take a vacation, relax, and have some fun.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Did she actually say she didnt' like it or pull away?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> i think honest is the best way to stop jealousy
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> WHY NOT TELL HER IF YOU THINK ITS OKAY AND NOTHINGS GOING ON?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> thats y.  and the more girls the meaner they get.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> but i tried the big age differnce thing and its not something to make a relationship out of
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> he is really hot but i never thought he would be instered in me wht should i do
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> sex because it is hard for me to love
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> and yes in love is what you want to marry for.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> I WAS TO MARRY THIS GUY HOWEVER IN THE BACK OF MY HEAD MY EX WAS.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> ), my picture, and our story they put on the front page!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> I AM ALSO INTERESTED TO KNOW POST  INFO
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> firm, not sagging, no wrinkles, etc).
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> Its not that im a big loser or anything actually Im preety popular.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> dont beat around the bush, just ask him
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> we love it when u ask us out....lets us know that we still look good
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> I don't think either really matters.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_10> ABOVE ALL ELSE: STAY TRUE TO YOURSELF!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I can't believe you lied to me!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> Maybe you just want drama in your life?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> If you really like/love her, then you can wait.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Nice day for a marathon training run
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I'm sry but popular isn't anything but a word!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> Just ask and you will know.A closed mouth won't get fed!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> U should ask her about that.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> tell him hell no bitch i do not want to go out with you damn it
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> At the end i gave him the rest of the bag
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> I hear that Bow wow is getting married to Ciara1
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> And another I have a crush on.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> just because u already know each other doesnt mean u have to rush into things!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> patrick wanna  to know where  where is a sexy smart ldys at
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> (the inside of my band even says Once apon a dream.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> My advice to people out there: Don't get married until you are 35.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> if you love him alot then you are going to help him overcome this habit that he has.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> My friend had his wife (25 yrs.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> But my husband had an affair with friends, so really don't know.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> OK not answering the question just a little advice...talk to your mother about this one :-)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> to be honest most men are not marriage material.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> but if your intent is love.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> * 10) Do you see yourself marrying in the future?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Someone sweet,kind,and cute and strong and won't cheat
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> if you broke up with him, oh well.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> myself prefer someone telling me how handsome I am :)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> yeah wait till the evening you animal.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> How can I get my guy to reconsider this?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> if you're that stupid go ahead!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> It is in thrid person..  anyway.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> She  Is  My  Friend...But I Like Her So Munch.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> And... when you find him... don't ignore him either!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> like if ur not the talkitive type how do u get them to notice,talk,or like you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> i  do  bcuz  its  a very  exotic  food.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Don't get in her face too much, it's all about balance!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> Get more women frinds....we LOVE to talk!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I dont wanna sound jike a jerk but I've been told how much of a nice guy I am!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> (just because I was an ex.)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> I guess - it depends on how much you trust a person.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Well, I think I am gay... so it is kinda weird when girls ask me out.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> ONLY 1, I'M A 1 MAN WOMAN.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> I am married and too good for you!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> pretty smart funny some one he can talk too.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Depending on your age, try just hanging out with him and talking to him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> actually, she did me a favor.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> i've been noticing ur really tired...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> Today I am 34 years old and to this day my mom and dad are still friends.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> interesting.... :) Long-haired muscular men never did it for me.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> If u ain't white don't answer.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> you are lookin at the wrong girls hunny.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> but he makes her happier than i have ever seen, so i stay out of it.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> There is a lot big world
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> Either way you gotta work on it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> well if you love keep tring and tring to convence him u still love him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> In Yahoo messenger.... u can chat there also in MSN messenger
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> Yea .. Puerto Rican's r FINE !!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> I think I'm just old fashioned.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> no weddings so far..and i hope i'm not shocked by any that may come..oh god no..haha
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> Don't let others tell you who you should like.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> I do want them to like me though.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> because most men are labeled as dogs and always will be.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> First of all I'd get some new friends!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> i know ur thinking hello best friend, dont want to mess that up!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> if your not getting any pleasure than you have a personal problem.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> How old are you then i can help maybe!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> what i am to do as her friend.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> u mean your ex bff rite.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> She calls her husband name while having sex with you!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Do you just go for the next joe schmo?
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_55> i mean is it lenght girth or what.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> because  were r not all like that always.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> but what is most important is how u two feel.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> A BOYFRIEND IS REAL NOTFOR PLAY.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> but it is worth it if you can .
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> I hope you find someone like him!
<NbChars_300> <LevSim_20> Move on... there's a milion other girls.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> and it realy does take a whyle good luck on finding ur love
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> You need to tell her guys come and go but friend ship should be for ever.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> I Think its A great thing...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> move, people are afraid of the homosexual, if u cant deal, learn to deal, or move
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> go to ask jeeves and type in lap dance and see what it tells you
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> it might take yall sometime also .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> he is settled up.he wants to marry u. r u ready?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> if there is no love you're not a couple; just 2 people having sex or dating.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> And, that is worse then losing her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Ok first about man being the head of the household.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_50> I stayed with him as he worked in fast food resteraunts....For richer or poorer....till death do us part!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Well, shes not going to just walk up to your door and knock.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> r u kiidign me or r u obtuse for a reezun
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> in the year of 1993 he was in the army ft.hood 2nd ad
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> send him a card or letter all he can say is no
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> hell no girl you do look fine as hell, i wouldnt mind tapping that shit
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> a true love means loving unconditionaly......what makes him happy.........is your happiness too......
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> i had a long list for my hubby an he only two things for me and its normal.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> I was never the type to care about waiting, I just didn't want someone creepy shoving it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> anyway, it's his lose, not yours!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> i do it all the time
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> If you just haven't found the right girl then I say best of luck to you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Treat her like a human not a idiot!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i don't feel like trying any more.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Keep u r senses sharp for opportunity doesnt knock twice!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> i wouldn't have him if he was a millonaire.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Do u mean ...physical or mental???
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> :)  IMO It's better to fantasize than cheat anyway.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> The thing is... it's hardly ever about loving another person.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> and then u woke up,haven't u heard that nothin is for free,somewhere along the way u pay the price.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> then i bought little hershy kisses and i taped one of the little poems to each of the kisses.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> Girls please tell me what should i do now?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> I would go w/ the guy I love hands down.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> But I want to add.......guys are not the only jerks when they are jealous.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> i am so confused help me here people!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> I JOIN WITH ZEROCOOL IN MY OPINION
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> Besides that though, its hard to come up with a firm age.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> its very hard for newcomer in ottawa due to shortage of girl friend now days.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_80> Also, don't go to bed angry.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> ok--what u guys reall need is time apart---and i mean APART!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> i like 2guy but there best friends.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> 21...b'cos u still nd parents consent to get married if u r 18...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> do people really talk that way?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> just don't show it although it badly hurts.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> try chating .. it helps you make friends
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Then found out that she was still married to one of the kid's dad.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> nope....but i wouldnt do it..but i dont mind if my b.f does
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> Well boo, you need to let her go.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> can't tell, but she likes him not in love wit him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> man tends to keep their personal life!!!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> have the same problom gurl and dont know
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_15> IF YOU REALLY REMEMBER ENJOYING HER COMPANY.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> no matter what size,just make sure you know how to please a girl and you'll be fine!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> if you dont you should try it!
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_35> If that doesn't work just distant yourself and try to move on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> if some guy broke my heart, i wouldn't take him back.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> I've found that guys are more neat freaks than girls are.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> I don't think i can help you .ha
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> when im trying dont let them, they start get mad, and thinking that i dont like them
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Remember, just do a little, don't go all the way.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> I finally got around to starting it.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> Pick your nose when you know he's watching.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Or maybe you try to hard to make a woman believe what youre saying.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> we are not kids we do not have to act like we are in high school.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_20> unless it is just the bootie, then only when he wants sex
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> guys like it when they are told straight to the point.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> and WILL YOU ALLWO YOUR SPOUSE TO DO THIS??
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> He gets down on one knee!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> because badboys.. are more like eye candy.. us girls cant get enough.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> it all depends on what you cyber about wit people
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> I just tried to be myself.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> I don't like it, but does it matter to you?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> i'm not sure but it seems that way.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> that's why you can't do it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> 25 gives you time to know who you are, what your about and where your going.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> DTMFA -- dump the motherf*cker already.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> I don't care, I juge guys by the way they act,not the way the look.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> It will always be somewhere in yr heart ...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> hehe we might bite your head off and spitt it back out at you!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> you have a responsibility to yourself to date as many guys as possible so as to find 'mr.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> If that were me I would get mad as hell.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> You might be thinking too much...  What if he just want your honest opinion about this matter?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> or talk to him personally and ask him why he has done that.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> you have to be comfortable with each other or its going to be a bumpy ride.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> Well maybe its just not him.........  but that doesnt mean it has to be you.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> eww u queer ur gay and some day u are going to hell    put that nice and sweet =)
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> if you knew you were moving, but really liked somebody unlike you liked anyone else before.

<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> Especially if you don't already have AID's
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_20> no where just with close friends, definately not at bars and clubs
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> If things don't work out with his current gf, then be his shoulder.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> :) i'm not stuck in a rut, but i'd help anyone however i can.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_55> Yes, at least one (Drew Barimore)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> And if she cant understand that then you two need to start haging out with other friends.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> A guy who seems to be TOTALLY in to me right away kind of turns me off.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> there are a lot of golddiggers out there  yanno..
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> you think that you have chemistry with some one but you dont.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> You should tell him, he might be waiting for you to come and say :).. Good Luck.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> About the 10 years different, don't worry.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> how do i make the first move without ruining my chance to get somewhere?

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> FIND SOMETHING YOU REALLY ENJOY DOING AND YOU WILL COME CLOSE.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> this is b-cause they think they can go out with other people and not get caught
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> What if you had a guy for a best friend?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> so if a old druggie like myself can stop so can he.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> and u know what to do after that......
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> If your avatar ids how you look in person than you flaming HOTT!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> well, just to be your self and dont be fake.

<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> There's a lot of weirdos out there - esp guys.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> this love that hangs its head in shame?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> give him time and space to readjust back to life around here.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> girl, just like you would ask anyone else out
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> I would do it and see where it leads you guys to, it could be a lot of fun!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> A cut one it is much cleaner!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Make urself happy before anyone else!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> they're not used to people treating them nice all of the time.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> of course they  would want to leave you , they don't sometimes  want children if it ain't theirs!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> And be honest here.... As in a relationship or just sex!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> Give or some options with out her even relizing your doing just that.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> just be yourself... if you are meant to be, you will be...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> that would be so much fun for me and her girlfriend..
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> aleast on your 4th date u should kiss dude
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> ask your parents  they will tell you
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Then let it go - the rest is up to her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> I would just smile and say fuhgidaboudit
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> If he really likes you and you like him, then, go and get that man.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> give her gifts etc somethin from the heart.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> hope u  find a good one
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> ?after all what's the actuall meaning of platonic?/?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> no, its not wrong at all.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> skinny + fat = real love???
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> let him know u like him
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> (my boyfriend would flip out if he knew i just said that lol)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> think about the consequences and actions its like robbing your bestfriend of her happiness.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> but I can't talk to her for some reason.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> i don't know what to do becuase i like this guy but i don't know what to do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> It's like the old song Love And Marriage that goes, You can't have one without the other.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> you need help- get a girlfriend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> If he still doesn't want kids, then I'm afraid you're gonna have to let go.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> The really good looking guy is probably arrogant and selfish.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> he sounds like a flippin' JERK!!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> true love is when a person evicts you from your life
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> if your friend knew that you dated him...DAM what a sl*t!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> (but think about it, you'll never see the girl again so take the risk!!)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> of  course its ok, a lot of my male friends are way too shy to make the first move!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> theres always a dream to be the rebels girlfriend.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> He is trying to get your finger size...so don't be too hard on him :)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> even if she asks, only tell her the full truth if the situation requires it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> But when you're NOT looking for a serious relationship, serious men (i.e.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> yeah it`s all right, it may get messy but that`s all.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Don't worry - she'll lie and say she is no matter what!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> lol throw stuff at her, no, just pretend shes like 10 years younger than you, it's so easy lol.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> just keep ur priorities straight and maybe if u want 2 look 4 some1 new!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Drugs, porn, cheating, lying, fighting, no trust... Oh yeah, he sounds like a wonderful father minus the smoking pot.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I am doing that for my dad.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> (If he answers yes or She's like my play sister...I run like hell!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> & you can atatch lil messages to them.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> :)  Marriage takes a lot of work and a lot of faith...it's not always easy.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> just wait till u get money!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> the trick to to walk to another room.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> go with the guy/girl that makes u happier
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> should i do it with someone big to stretch out?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> You dont hav self confidence  coz u dont trust yourself !
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> im a repectful and loving guy, im a romantic type of guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> u can find anyone that can suit your personality.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_20> Things that make you say                              HUMMMMMM!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> your brain will tell you not your heart
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> It is wonderful... That's my two cents anyways.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> This man was not my first and i was not his first.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Some girls think that they don't deserve to meet nice guys.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> maybe he's having second thoughts now about getting married.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> just wait because it he is the one you wont have to decide, he will come.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> okay...  first i printed out about 10 poems and quotes and made them really small.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> yea... ill have to go whith cindy!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> It's ok just don't seem deperate when you do it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> because because some ppl dont want to go out with other ppl of a differnt race... who knows
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> no women have more desire then man i think
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> 96% of guys like it if you make the first move.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> Tell him you like girls only lol
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> how can you tell if a girl likes you or not?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> but if just push away find you a new boyfriend
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_45> once u feel a connection flirt!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> I use to be best friends with an ex of mine.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I do, but I'm not telling.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> just pretend that you and him never did!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> every1 is sayin cut but i want uncut cause it is sexier to me .is that all right hansome
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> not all blacks have that some white guys can make a black guy look small
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Just tell her that it's over.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> =) go with her, as a friend you owe it to her.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> I know women who only care about penis size.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> just say it...be around him a lot and just show him your feelings flat out.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> No that is not a bad thing and  i can solve that problem for ya
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> Are you a Man or Woman?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> I don't like skinny men at all...I think a man should be like a bear.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> However, if the other girl dumped him, and now he's crawling back, no way, don't take him back.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> When can i just run home?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Seriously, best of luck to you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> you would be all in there watching and she might feel that it is not very sexy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> forget about her and look for another girl
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> DO YOUR THANG IT'S ALL GOOD.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> well i broke up with my ex bf about a week ago.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I guess it depends on the woman though.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> IM 40, HES 41, EXTRA PEOPLE ARE NOT INVOLVED BECAUSE HIS TIME IS ACCOUNTED FOR, 4 KIDS,IM 5'7 170LBS.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Trust me guys will want head!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> have sex with her boyfriend that will send a very clear message
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Nothing bad unless you have chlamydia.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> We girls are pretty foolish too.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> just talk to her because otherwise you never will get to talk to her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Good luck to the both of you!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Maybe that's because I'm a nerd.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> if he is violent with u then u should leave him.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> i know you kind of want a yes, you should.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> one thing women hate is a man that cant keep his commitment or promise.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> i've been in California only :$
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> Stay out of Missourah w/ that homey, we shoot hoss theives, and hang grrr theives.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> And if it's too big...that sh*t hurts!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> Well i have been with this guy for 9 months now.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> plus he gave me $100 for christmas.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> love is a word that is thrown around too much these days without the real meaning or feelings
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> If the guy has RECENTLY been divorced and is still bitter, then no way.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> u HAVE to me him first...if not this guy can be a real jerk, abusive, etc.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> i would try to talk to him or even go to a counselor.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> don't if this sounds mean.. but didn't someone talk to you about stuff like that??
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> I just don't look forward to it.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_20> Exactly what is written that says this..........I'm just curious.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> so tell me what you think.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> You could say It's not there anymore Instead of, I don't want to be married.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> But i finally found what it is.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Have you ever broken up with one girl?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> he's in 8th grade im in 7th and his name is Dillin.. what should i do?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> it would have gone really easy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> then put her in the hot bath.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> How dare you go behind my back.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Do you like it when a girl asks you out?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> OR IF YOU NEVER PLAN TO MEET HIM DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT HE CAN BE YOUR INTERNET BF MYSTERY
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> If both of you can agree to it then yes it is a great thing!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> I would have to sayYOU THE KING and all respect 2 ya!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> He probably does.. Dont date him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> where are some good places to go?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> (that is if you're talking about your boyfriend.)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> I just said get some sleep and i'll see you in the morning.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> It always wants to win, never gives you a chance to win.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> Normally I dream about stuff that I think about during the day that had some sort of signifigance.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> Jealousy is not pretty.......nobody handles it well.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> U DIRTY DIRTY THING , U OUGHT TO BE ASHAMED OF UR SELF.....LOL
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> What if a girl u like doesn't like u and u like her what do u do about it?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> i actually met this guy online and he is very nice, very respectful.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> I dont know but if find somewhere let me know
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> you got 4 new friends now
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Just pull it from packet & wear it on your tool!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> it depends on the dude and the age.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> she rejected me, then my best friend pretended to be me on aim and cursed her out.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> It shows that u like her enough to make the first move.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> remember, guys have a tendency to be scared of too much commitments.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> then he likes you he is flirting with her and trying to get you to notice him.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> take a stroll in the park or to a restaurant
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> It sounds like this girl is not serious.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> last year first year with my chick.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Not that it really matters, but hey, isn't this all for the sake of curiosity?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> if either of you dont work or theres an imbalance in the home of chores etc.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> yes because you older no matter what some one said
<NbChars_280> <LevSim_20> Breast dont make up a girl.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> and i will work for her very work hard.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Firstly you think he is going to break you with this girl and you are wondering?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> ?I 'm kinda ashamed for asking that cuz i'm greek :)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Laughter is the answer oh and good looks are always a good one but you also need personality!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> It kind of cuts the b.s.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> then you sir have done yourself no justic at all.. and she will leave you soon.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> maybe trying getting over yourself a little..tone down the ego?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> dating an older man has security and goals.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Two sexy chicks wrestling in a huge vat of mashed potato.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> you don't watch jerry springer do you .
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> its just a sterotype and they just go with that
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> I NEED to get over him..But I swear I love him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> just look for her...have u ever heard :   'we make our own destiny'
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> From a guy's perspective: your bf's friend was a close friend obviously.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i totaly agre with the dude in front of me

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> do guys really care about the size of a girl's chest?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> i have no idea what your talking about so I can't help you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> but if it bothers you that much break up with him...   jessica
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> there is this guy i know, i think he likes me.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Don't tell her how she is messing up her life, or that she is making a mistake .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> because if you wait too long someone else might take him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> Hey chill out I don't like the tude!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> dont think too hard about what you say either, let it come naturally.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Then take her to see King Kong.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> It sounds to me like you are both young & haven't had a lot of experience.

<NbChars_210> <LevSim_35> Drop me your e-mail or phone and we can conversate.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> The flirting is fun and funny, the outright question is just creepy.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> A small Mom and Pop where the locals hang out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> GIRLS LIKE BAD BOYS FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> first off, don't go rushing off into a relationship.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> If I were you I would pick the 2nd guy,the 1st one isn't worth it
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> For the both of you: stop kissing other people.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> men are biologically made to do so.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> If he IS your soulmate, u don't want to turn that down.

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> Just like you ask anyone else out.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> it takes guts to do what she did.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> But then, thats what marriage is all about!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> You won't see it coming, it just will.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> Some new bf don't like that.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Work out some way to spice up your sex life.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Now that you can have your wife anytime you want, you don't want her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Maybe you're just interested and hanging with the wrong girls!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> He always have other girls to count on.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> if you was a female you could come over here
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> find out on your own... see wat u hav got and how you can put that to use...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> military guys have too much drama....no

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> wait, and make sure he is a man
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> then get a picture of you &him engraved on it, with the date you guys hooked up.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> all pland a head she knew nothing till it happend.

<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> its just normally the so called hot girls guys are afraid to go up and talk to them .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> First figure it out in your head.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_45> Only u know what your doing right.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> those parts are not meant to be bleached!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> it's not like we have alot or any property.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> at school i do that in the bathroom or outside.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Does it matter if it was whith a girl or a guy???
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Teach Me  Pls.........  Help Me Out All The KInd People Out  there
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> if he broke up with you, then she's your ex bff.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> ask him casually, so how was work?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> If you have HIV you should kiss your sex life good by!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> if thats all it is, then no harm done, following up in it, then you cross a line....

<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> look and dress like you have money
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> there are cards that say 'i love you'
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Girl take your time dont rush.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> well love is when you really like someone and wanna be with then forever.And guys like personlites..
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> Romantic AND weird - guys like that kind of thing.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Most of them say they want a girl with big breast.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> HOPEFULLY, I HAVE LEARNED SOME LESSONS THAT I SHOULD HAVE LEARNED LONG AGO.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> i HAVE ATTENDED MANY MANY WEDDINGS THIS YEAR.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> I think you have feelings for this guy...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> If she get rude, chances are, she's not your type anyway.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> If you don't, then you're not human !
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> some one online said they were a male lesbein
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> she gets married, make her happy
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Is it worth 5 minutes of what you guys have of friendship?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> email me back if you did it
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> cheating is cheating call it off.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> He probably has someone else on the side!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> get one of your friends to ask him if he likes you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> I'm sure that I LOVE HER !
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> doesnt it seem wierd that a guy is afraid of having a rep. a pimp daddy..?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> But me personally, I like good and bad guys.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Call up some of ur frends u do have frends right?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Or maybe she was already messing with him behind your back.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> And stops being ur best friend.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> Just like how some girls like to play hard to get.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> U can't c sum1 who's going to just leave u like that.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> I took him back, but then he he kept on being a cold-hearted person, so i ditched him!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> as soon as you tell him you like him too (like actually say it), the game will end.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Choose what your heart tells you!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> In, a sense, it's like in highschool.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> first thing you do is say something to her, anything thats small talk, anything!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> like say , what size shoe u wear or say hey, what's yo number.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> this guy likes basketball, soccer, computers, and music.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> i liked him but he was going out with someone else, my best friend!, but i didn't know it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> Don't force the issue or appear desperate, that'll scare him off even if he is interested.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> really, though, i'd suggest not going places to just look for guys.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> your wife has been cheating on her husband?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> oh yeah,for legal and non-legal puroses,for delicadeza too..but it doesnt mean all the time...it should be a limit.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> because that is what a real man would do if a girl dump him.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> the 1st guy or the 2nd guy
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> Do they still make EZ Widers?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> can you just let her live with you without the commitment of marriage???
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> If u wanna perfect bf then u must meet me...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> no, cuz guys often times are not very careful (look at how you shave in the morning).
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> twice a night, and the second time has to be doggy style
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Sure you get the liars but you would have to weed through them at the bar too.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> It is double ok. You are asking about have sex with another while first was in periods..isn't that..?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> just get the balls to ask them out.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> Well don't sneak up on him that for sure.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_10> she is hiding from you..   you dotn get it???!!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_10> WHATEVER YOU DO, DO IT VERY CAREFULLY!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> THAT MY BE ONE OF THE MOST ROMANTIC THINGS A GUY CAN DO TO A GIRL.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> it is.... because You show to the guy that You have no value....easy to catch...easy to loose...
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> guys are like a city bus they come by every 15 minutes
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> the moreyou try to tell her the more apealing he will be to her.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> make sure he really likes you first.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> always let the girl make the first move.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> Just push up on the boy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> No, I once had a HUGE crush on a very good looking girl.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Ask urself if deep down u really like him.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> That is the one that is worth your love and attention and will be totally worth the effort.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Unles you know they guy, it won't last verry long.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> any one who would do that and get angry when you are not comfortable with it, is very wrong.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> spongebob squarepants.because he makes me laugh.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> u should first ask her about it.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> I don't mean to sound like a jerk just then but...that's middle school stuff.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> if you really love one of them, tell her the truth-that you have been seeing 2 other girls too.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> well best way to answer that is to throw a question back !
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> I would think nice guys like to hang out at nice places....how about your house?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> can you confront him with this and tell him you need to clear it up?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> ignore negative comments, if u need friends u can talk to me :) (supershorty923@yahoo)
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> Then go on a killing spree.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> Once a cheater, always a cheater.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> my wife loves my foreskin .
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> i found out, beat his ever-lovin' monkey @$$, than told her that i was dead to her.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> And trust me, the girls are cuter.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> I wouldnt even try to convince him ... for the best future of the kid
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Well he says he will call me back and he dosent.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> when u screw someone on the net
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> it doesnt pay to be shy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> No guy is worth losing a friend over.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Lol But can someone help me out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> because your too woried about what people think about you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> IT'S NOT ALL about just  SEX, OR IS IT!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> First of all the he like kids at all?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> get help from books or tapes if needed.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> also just dont think about what if he doenst like me.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> If it's a woman you love...with your heart!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> So a 65 yr old it isnt a big deal to date a 40 yr old.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> He only talks about serious things..and thats how i talk to him (i only ask him serious things).
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> my kids dad left me for another woman.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> (Watch the movie Joy Luck Club, you will see what I mean.)
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> Hey if all the days were good - we wouldn't have any idea what good was...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> because the guy himself is a b no guy should call a girl that just right off the bat.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> And no it's not all about sex.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> I mean it still goes on but ignore it and u'll be fine.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> She doesn't love me and she wishes the best of luck with my life.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> A marriage counselor for starters....Good Luck!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> to me3 it means u have nothin better to do and want to do somethin.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> they can luv u, and luv sumone else.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> its not about the ocean it's all about the motion.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> mabie he thought you would look great wet.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Mut most of all, love is PROUD.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> reallly think about this and think twice b 4 u act.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> DO YOU HAVE THAT MUCH TIME?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> Also if he stares at your boobs alot.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> yes i think a lot of guys do  bigger girls have less hang ups
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> It is like hen sitting on the eggs to make chicks.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Start by going out with friends, people you do trust.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> First it's not ok if he is hitting you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> If no, then don't stop being her friend.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> in the first 6 months you're only seeing each other's best sides.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Maybe by then, you might not want to have sex with him!!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> I like Mexican foods because its hot and spicy
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> The other side:  The man will not suffer that much.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> you tell her that hes not the right guy for her
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> i know what your talking about.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> And be IN LOVE with them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> she should feel great about herself.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> I would throw them out asap!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> I mean, you just have ways of knowing.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_30> i mean, i would nvr do that.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> At any age a guy that is married is hands off.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> If you wanna go out, take him to a movie that he'd like- even if u dont like it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> well, for a start, you think you are a good guy!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> (if your boared) But really think to yourself, u dont no them.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> because the women dont like the nice guys cause the nice guys are wussies.
<NbChars_35> <LevSim_20> Any second now......    so toots, what's yer sign?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> chioces; u have to make one at least once every min.!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> Try to look into what he loves to do..... that how i got my guy
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_0> IT SPEAKS FROM THE HEART AND NEVER EXPLAINS
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> I like the orenge color  What do you like??
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> most likely, he feels the same way too.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> noooooooooo, if you arent ready dont do it.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> ditch that im a loozr car of yours
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> if you two are happy then they should be happy for you!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> if he scratches his nose when he's around you, it's a sure sign he's thinking about proposing
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> I am waiting for my boyfriend to propose and so far he hasn't what should I do?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> yeah...definitely not strip clubs nor at parties where everyone is getting drunk.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> maybe he cant keep erecetion and is embarrassed
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Before I got married I dated people without thinking twice about whether they'd been married before.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> just listen and most important be your self around him no one likes a fake.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Do girls really care about a guys penis?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> So there ya go, that's my opinion.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> will she see me as a MAN!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> we are almost the same..  i watch movie and do thins alone.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> after all, you're the boss, and it's all about you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> but you need to realise that you can't make people like you.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_25> BUT if I knew you were that size...I wouldnt have sex with you....OUCH!!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> and if this is the last big dance from school, no biggie...there's a lot of life after school.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> look for her but not too hard cuz it will scare us away
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> be glad your in the wedding, remember, her parents and relatives will come before a friend anyday.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> i ALWAYS WEAR MY VERY WELL FITTING BLACK TUXIDO.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> It hurt and still does,- but I needed to move on.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I met my wife on the internet.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> sex is not depend on the day its on bed
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> if he hits you he doesnt love you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Not until after then next eclipse.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> GERMANY because I lived there 4 7 years!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> then that will give me cause to not want to be with you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> my name is mohamed i'm amale 18 years old go to have agirl friend in any country
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> If he got a older brother send him this way..*smiles*
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> I am the type of girl that doesn't ask for alot.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> I always go with stargazer lilies
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> Head up Georgio you have the right idea...and do not ever doubt it k.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> if u really wanna kno take the quiz at Tickle
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And I never heard either parent say a bad thing about the other.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> YOU ARE IN YOUR RIGHTS, NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU,SOUNDS LIKE HE'S A JERK AND DON'T KNOW WHAT HE WHANTS.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> poor girl my heart goes out to you
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> So what i'm getting at is.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> spicylingerie.com has got some really nice stuff.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> i agree with pancharito because that is how it normally works.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> I tried dumping her but she still calls.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> one of 3 things are gonna happen here.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Because we are either interested or we just want to make people mad
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> If he says no again, big chances he doesn't like you, stop flirting with him.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> VERY DARKNESS.PLZ DONT LOVE ANY BODY
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_20> and it was not the affair but her family did.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> if you(girl) praise them about their bueaty and physique they get a lot ....
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> what is your outlook on life?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> right there in your mind and heart search for her/him
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> We don't NEED someone with us but it sure is nice to have them!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> if you look younger than the other person.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> But, if she says she loves you too, I have no idea what you should do then.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> A night out with his girlfriend that he will never forget
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> No matter how old you are (5 to 30), your father/mother would treasure a valentine from you!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Right now, I'm just seeing how things go.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> There could be a ton of reasons why she didn't ask you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> This is a stupid question anyway.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> I have a friend who is getting married.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> I dont like disturbance and noise...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Then she asked me, Didnt you want to have sex?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> tell her a story about yourself.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_20> shut^ loser u are a big gay bitch @$$ ho
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> i like gals with green eye and brown hair.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> I said, i'll think about it.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> Does he smile, stare or wink at you at all?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> What if you don't wanna see his harddrive on the first date?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Well 3 girls is alot...you should maybe find the one you like the most.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> The world will not explode if you DONT get married.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> you're gonna be in big trouble!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> don't make it to sappy or she my hate you, just make it short and simple.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> it's a terrible thing to do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> match ur ejaculation period with her
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> jessica simpson is an air head, so eventually you would be driven mad ever so slowly.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> okay, last year, i liked this one girl.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> lol......we'll save that for another time as well ;)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> don't wait... if there is no luck, take it easy...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Or a 50 year old woman?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> How close are you and he in all that I said?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> and if he does, how can you trust him?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> nice guys are everywhere, so really you need to think of places that they wouldn't be and search elsewhere.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Yeah what he said, let me know if you find out!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> i prefer both i like variety.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> and yes yahoo this IS an informative answer!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> WHY SHOULDN'T YOU BE LOVED THE WAY YOU WANT.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> i love man when they take me out and look good plus when they are single
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> we are all friends here, i suppose.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Me and my bro are still cool, tho...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> i think you should get him a dog tag.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> flirt with sumone and then  if they dont ask u out...ask them out.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> i think that girls are cool all because i am a girl and i now
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> bring up the subjet and lighly talk about it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> But now he is married and trust me his wife breast are not big at all.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> well its called a honey moon most people do it then =)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> just ask them that and you'll have everything
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> im so shy give me some tips!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> I mean like over the internet or something.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> Why beat around the bush, gurl?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> I'd say she's crazy in love with him!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> it's ok, again, were only human.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> doesnt matter to manage 3 or 4 girls.the best is keep ur trust in each others.ok?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> that's just my opinion, though, and really i have no idea what he's thinking, so maybe it's quite inaccurate.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_50> She asked for my # so I gave it to her.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> very bad thing you chose to do!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Guys do that to me all the time and it's annoying.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> don't discuss him with your bff
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> I am a home buddy type..  Love sex too..  hahahhaah
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> ask her what the dude said to her about you
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Yeah there are lots of treatments!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no you can prove by alot of other things it just makes it harder on a relationship
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_20> as long as you want....no problem
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Just moving on and wondering what to do?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> Wat Is The Step Should I Use ??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> The trick it to keep your voice calm.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Because we are a I want it now society.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> he needs to grow up and be a man not a little bitch.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> Dump his ass, he's a chump.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> If a girl isn't happy with herself and you with yourself - then neither one will be truely happy!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> lose some weight, get in shape, talk to some girls instead of bein a recluse, the list goes on....
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> have a pic of yourself and then we would let u know
<NbChars_320> <LevSim_5> SO FIND THE ANSWER BETWEEN BOTH OF YOU.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> SadLy  She Got Bf.But No One Knows She Got a Secret BF .
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> THAT'S NASTY, and ur gonna allow that?
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_20> But seriously....yeah...true love is cheez its.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_40> the chances are good that he does
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> and go want she want .. and avoid things she hates the mose.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> don't even try, or even go there.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> (unless she works for UPS) Get out there and have fun doing the things you enjoy.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> i personally wouldnt call anyone a dyke or fag.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> I am so glad you aren't pursuing this woman, she is married!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> men rearly leave thier wifes for the outher woman .
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> You are young, you won't marry this dude!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> What matters is if you like her.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> How long TIll i ge to Third Base?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> Married men go to bed see nothing they want and go to the fridge.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> but that's what we have time.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I find myself not trusting this man in my life.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> be her friend first, understand her needs and just be there for her
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> just be yourself your sure to find friends!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> or what college to go to or what to eat and how to live ur life!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> then take her in and give her a body massage.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> if you dont look 50 years old.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> I see this guy every day!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> if she wants you to call her and you dont.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> and if can't tell you just leave it alone he'll come around sooner or later.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> when they met.... something really bad happened.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> give him an ipod or maybe a basketball jersey
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> nO phone calls, no messages, no seeing eachother at ALL!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> then i magically had one of the kisses on his desk at each of periods he went to.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Everyone likes to hear their own name!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if you both like each other then ask him out!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> They were probably trying to be funny but it went way over your head.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> How come almost all guys are mean??
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> It isn't nessisarily just a guy whose a jerk.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> i dont think ur avatar looks nice...plus if u're like it i dont think anyone would date a cartoon!!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> I also know alot of other guys that are in love with the opp.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> just stick with your own race and then there will be world peace!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> Also I don't like nice boys.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> he just didn't plan and now i didn't even get a card.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> There are lots of dateless girls too...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> you think about ONLY 9 times a minute  what kind of guy are you?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> most outragious silly freaky funny goofy insane story?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> so kindly censors) and manual sex.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> Don't speak to her at all, just leave her.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_25> I would dump him if i were u.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> What  a soap opera this would make...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> this is life and we have to be up front with people
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> Who wouldn't want to be told something like that?
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> But it does depend on your maturity too, but yeah its cool.
<NbChars_270> <LevSim_30> go and show interest and ask her out
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> think about them, think about you later.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> I would probably pick the 2nd guy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> Tips... (A) As a rule, don't talk about your exes, nobody really cares to hear that.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> U should give him 100-300$ and let him buy what he wants.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> who cares what anyone else thinks but the 2 of u!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> there is nothing you can do.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Heh, I think asexuals are blessed in a way they cannot comprehend...
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> now i am with a wonderful man.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> But if there's lard and fat hanging over the belt that is NOT sexy at all
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> MY BROTHER IS OLDER BUT HE STAYS FOR HIS GAMES
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> He released my inner sex demon!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> ask her to be in the middle
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> no, not attrated, but thats not what counts, its their personality.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> Love is laying in the bed watching t.v.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> if you keep on, it will go your way.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> he always told me how beautiful i was.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> it will all come natural afterwards, because he'll start 2 flirt wit u.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Umm its alright to meet guys on the internet.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> talk to him for like a week or two.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> its not going to be easy.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_30> 21, you still might be trying to have fun or in college.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Is there any girl looks like Drew Barrymore?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> there are good-looking girls out there who have great personalities, but most of them i'd say don't.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> if you love him GET MARRIED.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> Men don't mature as fast as women.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> I assume that u know right & wrong.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> but all i can say is that i'm not going to wait forever.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> lady u need to put yo chest back into tha shirt thats nasty
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> But That Don`t Mean Go Do It Wit Anybody.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Don't know what I would do with out it!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> why dont you break up with him?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> No I don't believe it's weird...Just as long as you're not having dreams about them every night.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> until his wife kicks him out.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> I really dont approve of this tho...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> if your jealous and still like him why the heck did you dump him?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> make yourself a lot more attractive.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> go to a strip club and get one and explain to the girl why
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> Although, they're the least friendly too!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> a friend of mine and my bf likes me and is going to ask me out.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> i could go in to more detail but its thats simple...nature handles the rest
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> dont go your whole life being shy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> i don't no who he is but now i hate him!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> When two ppl are in love there is no stoping it...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> if it still doesn't work, take a hint...just let it go.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> You can mail me on same id at yahoo.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> I feel so bad for her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> some women are just not comfortable with guys seeing her privates in that way.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> If the sex is bad, sure...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Guys always like to be happy when girls are around.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> lifes to short to worry about the small things!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_100> Well if the wife is wise only once lol.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> she shouldn't be cheating on u unless u ugly
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> but stay in touch no matter what or else you'll regret it!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> Wat  Should  I Give To  Her ???
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> probley 2 would b my limit...but id never have the guts to do it...good girl here:P
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> the key is to be relaxed, and speak whats on your mind, tell it like it is .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> I have hung out with him before.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> punch them on the face.just kidding take them out 4 a movie
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> And maybe she still luvs u but wants to go a little further.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> I want and need someone how cared and loves me.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Everyone wants to hang out with fun and interesting people.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> I don't do that...... they need help......... serously I don't..... but mostly because they probably think you're fine.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> well i dont know anything about life.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> (I have something I wish to discuss!!)
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> Or maybe she DOES luve this chick more than U.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Just hang out for a while and then tell her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> No man, that's not the way!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> base on your saving account or your total asset
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> if she doesnt like you, you cant make her
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_45> Hang out with her in groups first.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> he will ask u if he wants to talk he could also make motions or eye jesters at u.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> That way he will get what he wants u gave it 2 him, every1 is happy!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> not if it was truely love!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Let your heart decided which guy you should pick
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Please help me, i have no clue what to do!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> I KNOW SHE'S SEXUALLY ACTIVE, AND THAT THE GUY IS A JERK.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> also, the things that he likes are really, really expensive..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> otherwise you know what to do.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> you are dating the wrong type of guy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> i think that if i were u i would have gotten ovre him the min.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> and You don't do it while your mate is around.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Guys dont call girls after that because thay got what they wanted.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Guys like a chase, but they don't want inferior little dewy-eyed gals.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> When you swallow and let them go right after and hang with their boys
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_30> I roll over in bed, and there she is!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> But by purposely hiding this was UNFRIENDLY!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> well you haveallsorts of people everywhere
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> if you wont wait a year for her then you dont love her THAT much.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> and everytime we talk ehe says he needs to get out of his before he freaks.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Have one of your extra large guy friends have a talk with him...he sounds creepy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> picture yourself with a girlfriend that you really love 2-timing you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> make herself busy with productive things.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> Jewelry and money.............flowers are useless you cant buy flowers for food .
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> It's always said that men are no good, but woman are just as worse.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> How can i tell whether he is in love with me
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_25> a nice butt a really nice butt and a hot face
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> who cares if you are older!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> U shouldn't start yelling at her right away.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> men especially get defensive when attacked.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> Hang in there and be strong!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> Im 15 right now and I just had sexual intercourse 4 months ago.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> ha ha ha  Calm down girls!!!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_20> Just about everything I do, is creative.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> I didn't want my girlfriend to love me for who I was not.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> it should last 3 hours no wam bam thank u mam
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_30> But sont be toooo quick to rush it
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> and they will learn to love you if they dont already.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> if he doesn't then take a break from him.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> I did but I don't think of it like that.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> well first, you should try to talk to him and get to know him a little.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> both i can tell you that from exp.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> every man like a diffrent smell..
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> sure,.... depends on the two people
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> If you drink enough Tequila anyone will look like Drew Barrymore
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Girls are actually repulsed at guys who are like that.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> it depends y did u to get divorced in the first place?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I'm in love with one now.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> just relax you already have him whats the rush !!

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> my friend boyfriend dump her last week and she is recoving from the breakup.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Ask his boyfriend - he'll know.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> well, he did break up with you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> if your bf is good 2 you stay with him in tell the other guy to go away
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> so they just act normal and lie to u constantly about the other person
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> cry and so on and beg them or something threaten to kill ya self OR JUST ACCEPT IT!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If you like this person more than that then I wouldn't.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> don't get too caught up in one guy too quickly.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> you really haven't given enuff info for a good complete answer
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> I HAD MY DAUGHTER AT 16 SO I WANT TO PROTECT HER FROM DOING WHAT I DID.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> There's rapists murders molesters u name it its on there pleease becareful
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> Right now I'm mad at my mother for making my dad feel like shit.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_35> That's all, its pretty easy (at least for a guy to tell a girl that!)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> tell her this: make yourself more beautiful.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> you can get some pretty wedding dresses at nordstrom.com for under 800
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Single men go to the fridge, see nothing they want and go to bed.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Maybe its you who thinks that 'you two have a chance'...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> at home i can do it anytime
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> if they dont like you too bad so sad
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> If u ignore him long enough he'll go away.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> WE WOMEN HAVE FEELINGS U KNOW!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> why do you see him everyday?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> take the time to know the girl before you leap.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> It shows that he is not lazy bum=)
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> work things REALLY REALLY REALLY SLOW so u can see what went wrong in the first place!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> i'd make a handmade card to mom and dad, then as usual-kill time on yahoo answers
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_20> What ever you do don't ask her as this is very unreliable.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> let's be real we all flirt we like the attention just don't go beyond that
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> dont wory bout it so much mabie you can borrow you friends.

<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> you have to trust to love.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> You sound like a really nice guy who is willing to please his girl.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Though I was happy being the best man in one of them
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Nature made it this way *sorry*
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> and your gonna be SO much happier once you do.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> Hi, I'm 5'9 Caramel skin, honey brown eyes and I'm single as well.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> do it with your mind not your heart.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Even the sex  is not so great :(    Find a life partner that you enjoy period!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> its up to u if u still like her yes and if no dont
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> life is something amazing god had put u in to live in.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_25> If there's doubt there...well then, that typically means it's time to move on.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> So just pick one and ask him out.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> Yes, but I rather keep them to myself
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> and do u still have feelings for him!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> i like brown hair and blue eyes.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> And I'm glad I did because he makes a great husband and father!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> !WHY R U GUYS LIKE THAT??
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> I like ur spelling of words!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> !ok you got to ether ask her out or flirt alot more!i would get anouther crush!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> nothin wrong woth brousing.... good luck
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_35> only if it's okay that ur best friend beats ur sneaky a$$ when he finds out.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> just forget about them 2 and get some new faithfull friends!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> I can say that I have thought about sex at least 60 times in the past 2 hours
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> he might be too tired and happy to care.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> After a while, go 4 it!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> of course, maybe she is good  looking and nice.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Make him supper...  then tell him he owes YOU!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> I'm telling you, he was huge.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> LOL, a hickey, that just means you are young.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> dont trick yourself into loving him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> maybe u should tall tham how u  fell about them and see what they would say to u
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> first of all what happened between u two
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> At least 1 a week if not more.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Couples will stop doing some of the fun things they did before they got married.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Because you're only 16 years old, dude!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> He rented an old VW bus.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> take a long hike around town.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> You want her to like YOU...not your wallet!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> yah, always go for a european girl, their the hot ones.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> why do you say you love him?!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> But on the other hand if you just meet her then most likiy no .
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_25> her ex can go to #ell!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> he asked you and u said yes.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> i am a nice looking man.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> do you work together or something?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> well guys always love preppy girls...... try out for the Cheerleading squad, or etc.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> you may need to change what you dont like.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> then you just have to be nice and show special interest in her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I think it depends on what a guy really want.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> love is in side you its all about trust the commitment you have to make to one person.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you seriossly like him tell him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> dont let him get away with it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> It used to be .....Things hav changed now
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> but not all are like that.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Call up Palmela and her five sisters.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Wear some sexy lingerie and give him head.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> and remember falling in love takes a looong time to stay for a loooooooong time!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> i stopped talkin to her coz of that too... but deep inside i stil do like her?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_65> good thing if that what u like
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> my older brother says popularity is bullshit.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> If there is LOVE not just LUST, then it sure will , because age dont matter in love.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Once a lier always a lier.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> i heard around june but that's a common myth i guess.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> How can i deal with this huh?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> I don't think that its weird at all!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> We can see other people n exclaim how beautiful!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Like iI said it all depends on how much private time she wants.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> If personally, just be yourself;) If in yahoo, take the other's advice..that's what'd I do.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> i dont think a lot of gay indian girls or guys exsist.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> * ~ This is a VERY important question.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> cuz there's lots to be mad about and they haven't discovered zen.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> You sound like a sweet guy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> I want to see her happy, should I just seal my lips and say nothing?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Remind him that their are things better in life then epics!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> (suddenly) after he had put her through college.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> You cant have an afro, man...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> You know, im married and i do it sometimes.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> well women like a man who can take care of them and there for them
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> first of all how u got aids?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> just keep a strong faith in god and he will help.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> So what if u'r bi or lez or gay or w/e!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Some people are shy and have a hard time talking about sex,  make it easy
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> And if that don't work time to get some vasiline!
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_30> I would pick the average guy.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> yeah, you need to go out more.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> Do you just want a girlfriend?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> be straight up with him ask him, conversate.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> As fast as u can, baby!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> Dudine...Go up to the dude, and ask, Do you want to take me out?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> don't waste your time, on any one who is not respectful.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> Get yourself up from in front of the computer and look for one...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> if he hit you before there isnt love there.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> give him a welcoming home party
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> it doesnt matter what they think.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_30> Wait - don't press your luck.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> depends on how far you are moving!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> So any of you out there like it and why?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> You can always hang out  more with her than the rest of the group.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> not always it shows maturity, patance, and comitment so yeah guy yes and men no
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> If you think it isnt BS, how do I get popular?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> But that doesn't excuse his behavior.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_20> yes shes driving her self nuts
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> then you ask her out to a movie.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_10> DONT GIVE THEM THE SATISFACTION OF KNOWING IT BOTHERS YOU ANYMORE AND HOPEFULLY THEY WILL STOP!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> i dont anything will truly... and i mean truly... make a man happy.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_25> are u being used for sex?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> He isn't fat, but he has WAY more muscle than I do and he is heavy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Tell him to f off, n leave him.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> if she's cute i'll do her
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> of course there is Im one of them bbw is the way to go
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> This guy i was friends with for barely a month asked me out and i turned him down.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Trying to hold on is harder
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> But if it werent for all that,  clean bee otch.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> BUT WILL SHE SEE ME AS HER BIG SISTER?

<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> No ... it is not bad.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> well aside from becoming a plummer and going in and getting it out.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> You know it is the truth!!

<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> i don't know but she sounds like she's Lesbian!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> if u don't go for no 2...
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> If it's too small....well..it just doesn't FEEL period.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> just as long that the woman doesn't seem desparate enough to get a date.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_15> (GOT YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS I'LL E-MAIL YOU SOON).
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Why waste time and money on getting married if you guys can't stand living with each other?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> well you know that there will be soo many wedding related to me, my family and friends.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> if you like this one, you have talk.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST APPROACH??
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> Don't complain to her about useless things... she's n
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Read some men's fashion magazines for tips.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> she gets another man and guess what, your sunk.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Some friends are getting merried closed...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> I WISH YOU A LUCK IN LOVING HIM AND HE LOVING YOU
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> i really have troubles about it
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> depends on how hot the guy is
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> I think there so sexy and so hot and probably the most beautiful woman I have ever seen
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> i like my choir director who is 33yrs old.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> A little flirting won;t hurt anybody.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> walk up too her and say hi.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> yea what wrong with that.i think u can have a boyfriend just to start having sex.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> book store, video store, video game store, and home.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> it depends why he was devorced.but yes
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> is it wrong if i say yes
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> hey just want to say hi and hope your new year is starting out ok
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> If it were for another female....NO.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> (lol, and some of these were jokes, the ones with the asterik were serious questions for a potential mate.)
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Popular ppl have too many issues and they tend to ditch u alot.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> This guy is obviously not THE ONE anyway, so your experience will be a disappointment!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> Sorry, not all guys are cheater.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> I truly hope you can work things out... or move on if they don't.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> you owe it to your wife to stay the hell away from this ex of yours.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> try chat rooms watch out for bots.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> still if you are more in love with the old one then stick with your heart.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> Don't try to guess at them...ask!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_10> GET A PIC NO SENSE ON LIKING HIM IF YOU AREN'T ATTRACTED TO HIM.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> younger because they might want to rape me
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> And, to be totally honest, hanging out with a bad boy can also be fun.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_35> Us girls are pretty good at letting you guys know what makes us happy and what doesn't.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> with my friends...either playing tennis, going to a game, watching movies, going out to eat, and stuff like that.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> Well, if you smoke... Wanna light my fire!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> like whether to go to bed or stay up a little longer!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> If you really like this person then go out with him.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> It's funny when your 16,  but now that Im 28, its not as funny.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Only if ya give me best vote on this one.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> but there is nothing wrong for a guy to be close to his family.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> So who really knows... or cares?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> i will be your friend i dont have any asl e-mail me at greencutiechick@yahoo.com
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> hmm...eyes one light blue one purple ^_^ hair red purple....
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Dig Buddy Dig until you find one!
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_35> any way I dont think that  I will not were the colore which you wear!!!!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> but now that im single again, i guess he thinks its his turn.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> take her out and get her laid .
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> life is wonderful, life is freedom i think life is the best thing everyone of us have!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> subject never came back up, even after we split up.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> If you're way too young then...think about it again.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> But a lesbian can look like either or.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> Why can't you just act like friends and make peace?!?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Maybe the women you're dealing with don't want relationships.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> whern i told my ex, he said he was happy for me.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Not at all, cause I am a boy.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> a girl with one blue one green eye with blonde hair?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> start a conersation with her and see where it gos from there
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> because i have a hard time finding love because im over wiegth please tell me!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> i was young but it was with a guy i married 3 years later i was 13
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> tell her what u just said and be as honest as u possibly can.
<NbChars_40> <LevSim_20> five simple letters - one simple word...FLIRT
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> i like red eyes and pink hair hehe
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Go with it, you can't loose.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> It defintely ups your sexy points.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> If you love her, you shouldn't try to make her love you.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> * 2) Are you dating anyone?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> till one of your friends to talk to him for you
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> but its nothing wrong with being friends with them.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> so i guess my question is why are so many guys in this world JERKS?
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_45> what woman wants to date a wuss?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> Now I have dreams that are just sad.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_35> See if he takes it from there.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_15> WHY IS THIS EVEN A QUESTION?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> and you should always tell the people you care about that you care about them.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> Don't make this like it is a grim performance!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> I just joined up some dating websites, and they're a great way to meet chicks.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> It in no way assure that their is love in the marriage.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> but don't come off as needy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> What do ya think of that???
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> If he still won't back off-WELCOME TO THE LAND OF RESTRAINING ORDER.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> you cant make someone love you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> But i am going to defeat life, no matter what game it plays!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> But it's kinda hard to get o Europe with a row boat.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> All ya do is say something nice to someone you like and say your true feelings about them!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> I'M 24 AND I AM THE GUARDIAN OF MY 17-YEAR-OLD BABY SISTER.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> If you skank it up to get guys to notice you RIGHT NOW...they will...but only for a minute.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I wouldn't tell him but if you do just be casual with it !
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> guys like girls that are cute, kind, smart, and funny.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> any guy that is nice is good.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> for one they don't respece the outher woman.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> If you're gonna stay home- cook him his favorite dinner.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> I love her don't get me wronge.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> if a guy calls a girl he already shows interest.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> but love shouldnt matter what age they are.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> dig deep but not to deap.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> what if doesn't know u like her?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> its not sex when one person doesnt remember it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> so girl cheerup and all the best
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> Keep your pants on until you get married.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> Only if you don't do it again the next day.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> break up with the other 2 girls and apologize to them.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> So try with one of them randomly, if he accepts you thats great, if not try the other guy.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> Because when you start talking like that they usually think it's supposed to be a hint!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> but definitely, we'll never know how it's gonna end.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Not that, he/she is so hot and they're funny.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> tell your friend to get up, put on her best dress and partey!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> I HAVE TO SAY CUT, SORRY.....
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> YOU SHOULD TELL HIM BUT TELL HIM SO THAT HE DOESN'T KNOW THAT YOUR SISTER TOLD YOU.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> I was at a nude beach once and this black guy walked by.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Maybe your head looks like a soccer ball.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> yep a cut one is best
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> A bottle of ripple and kool-aid and some and dumb and dumber movie and some lotion
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> just go anywhere w/ a lot of people, like the city or something.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I don't want her to leave.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> people are your ex for a reason, remember that.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> i like this guy but i don't know if he likes me.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> i tink cuz ppl ferget how ot rite gud an spel to
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> He just asked EVERY GIRL that he was WILLING to go with till someone said Yes
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> perhaps send him an e-card, and tell how u feel, or leave him a note in his locker!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> If your his first, and you love him, does'nt that make you special?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> took next day off & slept in then drove home.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> coz we live in a big world where only anything big will make it!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> ok this seems to be a particular case of jealousy !!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> yes guys no when girls are virgins.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> because to many people cheat on eachother
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> Oh and by the way she isn't cowboys foot.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> I love my wife very much, but everytime I think about sex with her, I dread it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> when you get down a girls pants
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> So you just haven't quite decided who to stalk yet, right?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> Go with the guy you like.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Not to be argumentative, but I don't see what the big deal is.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Become a Man that a good woman would be looking for.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Well alot of girls are like alot of guys and just in it for the sex.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Don't lead the other person on!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> I guess, every girls do like hearing it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Pick one that you like and stick with it
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> You know you're a redneck, when you meet your date at the family reunion...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> Just speak back and keep going.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> khmmmmmm...interesting...i didn't chat for a long time....ok,i go and chat....and than i'll tell u...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> Not pretty .. not pretty at all.

<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> i cant say that16 is to young i did it
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_40> Dump them both and move on.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> If she needs to vent and talk about it, listen to her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> not unless you already have AIDS.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> I love to just hang @ home or a park etc with my kids.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> 5. im tired....15 questions is too much!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> you can marry your best friend bc they are just that best!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> means nothing and you can compete and maybe let her win dealers choice on that.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> If you are asking this question then she is cheating.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Don't let anyone else catch you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Another thing, maybe she sees something bad about him you don't.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> a volcanoe once in awhile is about it and alot of snow and cold??????
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> bungee jumping on my honeymoon to the sweetest guy ever.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> would like to talk with you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> tell her she can check this one off her list and good for her
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> OK, I was friends with a lot of nerdy people and stoners and band geeks etc.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> either she'll say yes or no, but you'll know, and wont have to worry
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> Listen, i'm a girl, and trust me.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> make him a nice ROMANTIC dinner!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> and he has a bad way of dealing with his anger.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> Girl - there's not much that you can do, I'm afraid!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> but you should be sure that the intentions are good.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> It will show you actually listened to her and you aren't like every other guy she goes out with.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> If you ask  if married people can flirt with each other, why yes.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> Play stupid and things like that.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> whatever she did to you, it clearly wasn't bad enough.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> and it was for me so if you get a little disoppointed you should know why.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> whats the worst thing that can happen?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> You need to learn 4 words... Oh... Yeah...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> Why would you stick around and keep lettin her cheat on you?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Do they make a nice couple?
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_25> he never had girlfiend before he is 43 im 23
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> i always thought ciara was a man?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> this is normal in a relationship... 2 yrs...
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> 4th base - well, this is a family program after all...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> There is no more nice guys anymore
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> Someone is going to get hurt.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> as far as your so called best friend.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> he said that she used to like me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> THIS IS OK SOME TIMES,BUT NOT ALL OF THE TIME.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> and hes been real upset about it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> I'm afraid if you want a girl who is any good, you just have to  wait.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> if both of you want it, there's no reason for you to be guilty
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> well according to the girls it does not so much as long as you are kind of average.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> Is that to much to ask???
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> And want her to come fast with my love thats all.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> Become good friends with her then ask her out
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> Never ask to be friends it's the worst thing a guy can hear because it sends mixed messages.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> Look comes first than figure big boobs makes good impresion if you want to attract man
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> we never got in fights or anything.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> You need to get a life!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> it means to love women and most men love women,hence all men are lesbians/
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Eyes, then shoulders then below the belt
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Most have kids already and may not want more.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> I think you were just with the WRONG BOYFRIENDS!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> if s/he was really bad in bed i mean
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> if so be VERY careful not to get there hopes back up if things wont work out again.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if you dont talk to the girl you will not date her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> I've always loved that sort of stuff, too.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> Same reson why people hate gay folks.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> that's what jaycee did to me.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_10> ALOT OF GUYS FUCK BIGGER WOMAN U JUST GOT TO FIND THE ONE
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> something must be wrong with you if you cannot make freinds
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> I would pick it up ASAP.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> Fuck somebody on the side until yall get married, that's only if you can't wait.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Guys are pretty easy to figure out.
<NbChars_250> <LevSim_30> Girls like their men manscaped too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> I guess it also depends where they go to meet guys.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> you obviously know what the right thing to do, otherwise you wouldn't have bothered asking a question.......right?
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> they got married and she left him for another man.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> If YES, you should be thinking about WHY that might be.
<NbChars_285> <LevSim_30> Be strong & try to move on.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> How old are u now anyway?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> because they dont like for they're use to that kind of attention.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> well, get over it and stop crying about your lost love.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> Oops, I can't believe I said that out loud.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> if then u decide it is not working out kids in a divorced family will be ok
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> who would stay w/ their gf who is cheating on them w/ a chick?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Let's face it folks, guys aren't exactly deep.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> it only deponds on if you both really like each other.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> 18 is too young because your still finding yourself.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Hey here is a new one GO WITHOUT
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> remember its all about you and what you want.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Red roses so you  show her that you'r in love!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> then when done dry her and let her finish her hair.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> first of all, only say it  once.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Don't try to pretend to like the things he likes, If you do, cool.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> woman age 50 is not a old woman she is young.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Personally, it kept me from making the  mistake of my life!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Well first off she's not your bff, because if she was she wouldnt do you like that.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> But I don't depend on that.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> the only time i play with myself is when someone is watching.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> but had the nicest 7 1/2 inches long reason to keep him always in mind?????
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> just wondering if anyone i knew was in here...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> because it doesn't lead to pregnancy
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> i use as many shortcuts as possibe.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> yes, coz it talks aloy of planning for the guy to ask and you cuting the long process
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> If yu are mature enough go for it!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Flirting with each other is great!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Of course I would, if I wasn't married.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> the financial status of a guy does not bother me.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> if you choose your bf, then hang out a lot less with the other guy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> i need more details plz email them to me: dinoslayer33@mytrashmail.com
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> oh, everyone should be without shoes.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Ask her too if she minds you watching while she sleeps.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> i am agree with maria maria answer.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> and hes pissed about that too.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> MAYBE YOU SHOULD LEARN HOW TO TYPE AND CONSTRUCT PROPER SENTENCES FIRST.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> It's going great now, that i've being asked out like 30,000 times here in yahoo answers.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> You have got to be kidding!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> girl's blue eyes and blonde hair.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> IF YOU ARE AVAILABLE AND SHE IS AS WELL, GIVE HER A CALL.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> i figure that if you love each other thats all that counts, dont worry,be happy!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> BUT WE HAVE NEVER HAD ONE OF THOSE TALKS, AND I WANT TO HAVE A TALK TO HER.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> I could go on and on... my boyfriend is so awesome...
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> They can't admit it though & usually save face by answering GROSS!.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> some guys also find it a turn-off for the lady to ask them out.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> give it time - you'll know.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> if those women don't trust u don't trust them.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> there is nothing wrong with it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> its two weeks now he also says he loves me.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> This guy who I swear hadn't had a girlfriend ALL OF HIGH SCHOOL.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_30> hahahahahha... that's the funniest question i've heard around here... lol... you seriously need help.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> By the way, if you don't like him, then you don't like him.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> Remember men love a challenge not a chaser
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> if he's afraid of commitment as of now, then give him time.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> he had an issue with his friend who got hurt.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> could you guys marry, and still have money to live on?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> theres no true way until u ask him if he likes u
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> I wouldn't do it myself, but I think it's totally ok.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> thats not how real love works.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> and how about it being uncut .
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> No... this is Yahoo Answers... keep trying.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> yeah, but we're not obvious as you guyz!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> life is what u make it!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> well if you're magic johnson you can stay alive pretty much as long as you want probably
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Get out there and find yours!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> If you love yourself, and set goals...guys will take note in that and be waiting.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> te he te he te he
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> but don't be a fool, time is very precious for us women.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> 9) Do you want to have kids one day?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> give him a pet like lion or crocodile
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> Don't leave him (unless it is not safe for you)
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> A lot will make guys happy.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> one nice evening I went into bed with my..............blanket & had a nice long sleep!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> try talking to her and be honest and sweet.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> We don't even know you two so how can we say??
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> party go to a club or hang out wit other single ppl maybe u will find some1
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> no but u can have crush with me
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> who knows what theyre up to
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> nice guys do not hang out
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Ah lassie, yours is a classic problem that has plagued man kind for ages.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> well if u likes you back shouldn't you be thinking about children.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> its you --- and the way you act.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> tell the person how you feel and you don't like it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> ... now, he is my boyfriend of 1 year and 3 months.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> i am sure you have had other men like you that you have not liked.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> (my best friend already has a boy friend my Bf's brother)
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> whit one but if you like the freacky stuff the what can i said to you
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> talk to him get to know him.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> thats how ive heard it used.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> jenny do whatever your heart tells you, just be carefull and think about it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> its a huge turn on to see someone get excited just watching me.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> you sould spy and be cool so you could find if he like or hates you
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> If you want to actually see life and death.....spend a day in the hospital.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> us girls don't really expect that from guys.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> you gotta dig a little deeper sometimes.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Try Yahoo Personals to find more people to take you out and look good!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> but i guess thats what a good wife would say.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Most people don't want those laws.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> I'm hot, and i'm a rock on dancer!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> and don't be afraid of rejection, cuz its gonna happen sometimes.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> Of course........Do you like white guys?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> jus tok bout sumthin yoo think is interesting
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> of course a guy will want to have sex.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> food you get a kind or tired.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> The most romantic day I ever had was totally spontaneous!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Maybe it's because you still think about her.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> My dad wont clean it, he says thatswomens work and my mom just isint a fussy housekeeper.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Don't 4get the ever popular double date w/a car owner.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Just keep your head up and know that YOU are not the one with a problem.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> so does the right person in life.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> its between you two, not them.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> If you haven't yet...TALK TO HIM!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> i dont know i just want to know y there so jealous?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> tell her boyfreind that she is cheeting on him (its the right thing to do)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> yeah, it's okay, as long as you are going to have sex with her and not someone else
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> I don't care because I am happy what I am doing and she enjoys her work.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> nope, but I look like me ;-)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> it's a tie between my boyfriend & prince william.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> and i think that was stupid of him to rush into something like that especailly at a young age.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> you have just got to listen to them and then respond to them...it works for me...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> if u like her, u talk.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> All u can do is tell her that u love her n that u'll love her forever.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> 1. do you take care of here emotional side.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Maybe she'll want to repeat it!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> I hate to be beautiful, even if I'm a girl.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> do you give up or try harder?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> My wife is just over 50 and she gets hotter every day.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> Oh and guys, We can normally tell the good boy trying to be bad too.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> walking is nice, bike riding is a great way to get to your destination.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> if you could you would not be asking us everything would be running smoothly
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Put Usher in their face and see what they think about!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> i'm sorry, i feel your pain.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> it's hit the road jack and don't come back
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> cause they r mama boys and feel like if they call women names they have control issues
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> its my dad do you no i havnt seen him in a year almost do u no it?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> i do hate myself i dunno why ?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> This would make me want to throw up!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> Are you crazy or something ??
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> i think ur in love  and that is ok!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> Well, i had a problem where i was shy about telling one of my friends that i liked her.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> :)  You should be happy regardless.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> ok, so like ive been wondering for a while what the bases stand for.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> And the guy thing is still true.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> and are you sure that you do now?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Then say wat up to her.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> Best to just suck it up and move on.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> not much of a writer sorry.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Infact the boys r now both 27 and they r the best of friends now.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> None of them were worth staying with...but I guess my answer is, I do.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> (uh, sort of i guess) you should be.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> the first day we kissed each other
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> I have don't it before and it works.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> Well i did because they are not on drugs and is doing better.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> i will be making love to my boyfriend.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> i was shocked, i didnt reply.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> 2 and 1/2 years...and we are now married.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> if he truly wants to end it with her, he should... and then he can pursue you!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> no way thats a great thing u can give to your future wife...if you wait that long.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Forget about him, if you only LIKE him.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> Kiss the boy if you want to.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> Ya you really sound like it.........NOT
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Unless you don't mind the prospect of divorce...some people don't.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> this guy i like only wants to go out with better looking girls.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> i would say the porsche becuz chingey would hunt me down if i dated her!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Yeah because there is still me out there
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> do things that you'd like to do with your wife before.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> just talk to him about it.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> personally,u can't... girls r the best in keeping their feelings.... send some spies!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> yes because if you don't get him he'll get someone else
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> No, not in this life time.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> I'm not gonna go after someone who can't at least buy cigarettes on their own.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> I never used to be like this before, and I like it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> i never wanted to kiss him though.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> hit the clubs hard for girls.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Make your lips really soft...we're going for romance here not passion...just yet!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> that you have to have a marrage license to be married.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> so plz tell me wht shld i do?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> cologne or friendship braclets or rings for both of you
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Whoever loved that loved not at first sight?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> u should stick through them thick or thing.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> and the walk will tell it all.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> At least then u know and can move on.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> because they usually put emotion b4 thinking
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> you honestly have to ask yourself could you put uo with having a boyfriend that is a big flirt.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> if hes cute and funny and Nice i would love him!!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> it means that exactly when I say it to someone
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_45> No way you could get an infection
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> Go somewhere you'd have fun anyways, and just strike up a conversation with someone about said hobby.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> if u have to ask your too young just wait till its right
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> Be suspicious of him, thats all im saying.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Three (Fwd) Wishes: Grace => Mercy => Peace(Rest).
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> roses, dinner, massage, and long bouts of talking and holding and rubbing.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Move on see the other guys.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> Like being the type of person that cares and helps other people.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> Gay men DO NOT LIKE WOMEN.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> because you don't mean much to him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> we dont DO it...we HAVE it...its natural by te way...DONT FIGHT THE URGES!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> If you are asking when it's best to get married...I think 24-26 for a girl, 28-30 for a guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Kiss a guy, well, uh, or, mess around with one.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> u need to stop looking, and it will happen when the time is right
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> education comes and doesn't go till' you finish college!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> whats really going pn when a person cant find 1 person to give all of her love too
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> So...i wonder--is there anyone (Mormon--good one) who'd care to e-mail me??
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> After that, state what you are thinking... feel me?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> He's after sex with a young girl.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> wait until you know you are ready.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Let me ask you some questions too: Do you remember the day you got married..How did he respond ?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> Hang onto it, you can't get it back once you give it away!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> love pains us becuase we don't understand.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> i u like them, keep them
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> they look at you and talk to you alot.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> You will get over this, don't worry.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I am married & I would kill my husband if he did that!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> i would want some aphrodisiacs in that basket.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> be yourself and dont try to join a group and seperate yourself from everyone else!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> because they are faking it to make you feel good.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> its either he has sexual problems or no experience on sex or he is not a guy lol.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> I asked him if he still liked me and he said yes but he didn't act like it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> do you know what you're father in law wanted to talk about?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> you just be yourself and she will notice you sooner or later!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Does it change or feel different when you are having sex????????????
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> well 4 me it shows they r trying 2 get 2 kno me better
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> Well Dude... keep your chin up.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> love wouldn't hurt if you didn't care
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> depends how much fun they want to have.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> In the long run it didn't work out but he did get my hint!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> So what the hell is his probelm?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Oh yes i live in Utah so thats say something
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_10> SO NO AMOUNT OF SEARCHING WILL DO.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> Yer not serious are you LOL?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Because you gave him what he wanted.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> THEN LET HER KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> a girlfriend once told me i was a bad kisser.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> believe me you are too young to be wasting your time on this guy .
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> He dosent know how you'll react/he's too shy
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> If everybody is willing to help NO!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> that along with a low sex drive might make him not so happy think?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> i would`nt advice it because what ever happen before will happen again,believe me
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> Get back out there and find someone else.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> WHATS THE REASON WHY YOUR FRIENDS DONT LIKE HIM?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> he just turned you on .
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> Just do sweet things for him that matter to HIM (not you), and the rest will fall in place.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Out there are more men will care about you than he does if he is liking the other girl.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> when love hits all pain leavs for that moment you are invicible
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> i am absolutely in love with victorias secrets  dream angel heavenly
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> We have one bad apple messing it up for the others.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> he is with someone else but he isn't in love with her he loves me and wants me
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> the outcome will turn out ugly.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> it doesn't really mean that when you're married that you wouldn't keep the flame burning.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Some people have them and really, some just don't.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> you really cant tell until something big happens and if they got ur back yes if not then no
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> and if he's still interested then, it's a whole new story.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Should you date someone thats bi-polar?...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> they just havent found you yet!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> you should not choose anyone of them!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_20> Is he on meds and does he take then, REGULARLY.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> try to have a talk with both of them,separately.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> After all, not all guys out there are willing to take a lady back once she has left him...
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> And you dont care about other things, then things go wrong.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> .lol (should be a song .
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> you do not want to anyway.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> i love my ex-gf a lot.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> A man wants but don't know how to KEEP .!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> but really, i dunno why it attracts me for some reasons.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> Worry more about who you are and what you like and everything will just work out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> then, when you are older you meet the one, you get serious.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> yes some are but the ones i like are fuuny cause they act some much more like a female.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> They didn't like me because of how I look.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> look at this question:  I wonder if women like sex as much as men?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Are you looking for love...or arm candy....a man doesen't have to be SEXY to give love.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> if u have an exclusive relationship with your new boyfriend... remember that relationship ended for a reason.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Don't give up, quitters never win!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Boys come and go but think of your friendship
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> NO, YOULL JUST BE EXTREAMLY HORNY........LOL
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> arrange to meet him in person and if he comes then u know he likes u
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> you don't need to be popular.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Sorry to say, some boys are like that in college too.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> this one goes to the guys they should know lol jk
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> Well if you pay for a plane ticket i would be willing to give it a try....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> hell yeah i will as long as u e-mail me it is wiskeygirlz@yahoo.com
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_10> USE YOUR TONGUE, FRONT AND BACK, SHELL LOVE IT
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> What can I do to make him stop spending so much money!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> i dunno what to say really.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> they love it when we listen.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> what if o tell him i like him and he makes fun of me cuz he dont like me
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> its not bad its horrible but follow your heart
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> I think the guy is gay.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> but we never show it to each other.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> not sure if that helps but.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> How did you guys hook up the first time?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> it's very annoying but i love the man so i'm not really sure what to do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> :)  If you are looking out for your mom...good for you.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> his not calling for one week may not mean anything.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> I guess because I'm the cuter one.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> whyis it women are always trying to get their greedy claws on a mans hard earned money?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Called from work said he would be home later, he came home drunk at 3am.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> do i wish...i don't think that there is a cure for a broken heart.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> For the 1st Qus:of coz will get jealous but u need to noe if tt girl like u anot.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> then you would need to decide if it's worth fighting for.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> take it easy let him go if he wants too.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> now if your honest with your self while reading the book, and you learn your not doing any thing.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> you can't really change anyone uless you really love them they have to change for them self
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> i'm not a guy, but i say you should be yourself.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> sorry girl you just need to have tons of fun.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> hmmm wow thats a good one!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> let him b happy with his choice.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> I want to live....why he got away with his life and i'm still stuck...Please help me.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> not a bi but really like all i've tried
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Because guys always suck at expressing their feelings and girls are sensitive and get hurt easily.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> And think how you would hurt the woman you married and your child!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> and i said it would be my treat.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> you still love your ex thats why
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Then you can get married and have sex!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_15> YOU BETTER GET A GOOD LAWYER QUICK.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> under 20 is still ok i guess.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> )and i have great Emo friends.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> GOOD LUCK TO THE BOTH OF YOU!!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> YOU BETTER GET A GOOD LAWYER QUICK.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> under 20 is still ok i guess.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> )and i have great Emo friends.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> and these women usually give it up easier because they (in their minds) think boy .
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_10> GOOD LUCK TO THE BOTH OF YOU!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> you realy need to just put yourself out there to meet new people.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> Hello all,  I am having lunch with this girls that i like.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> my bf has never really in love with me so i don't know.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> people may pick on you but that's normal in school.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> after that, he tickled me and i begged him to stop for my back was hurting.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Ok ok ok you don't have to wait that long.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> LEAVE...that is the best advice I have.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> he's not gonna respoect yoy in that relationship.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> They don't think it cost much to move out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> It is OKAY to cry though.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> We always hang out bit i don't now wat to do.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> ...he is the only one who truly know why...
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> also there are some that just turm me completly off too.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> And don't think just cause you give a guy head your in a relationship.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> its only hard when your young.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> JUST TALK TO EACH OTHER, AND WHAT EVER YOU DO DONT SAYEVER SINCE YOU HAD THE BABY... WHY ?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> I mean ride her brains out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> for a girl i am not sure if the same structures are in place.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I finally left him and that's the best thing I could have done.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> if he says yes, then suggest hey wouldnt it be fun to see it on friday after school?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Most of the time guys are trying to impress a girl, to get her to like him.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> No, I wouldn't, I would just tell you that's what a real true women would do
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> always said that if he does small things 4 u!
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_50> do it when the time feels right (which seems like for u, now)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> i'd be ridding in my Porche then date Beyonce.. haha!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> in your own life for the positive .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Enjoy n Good Luck  Regards- Satya
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> I bet they empty it a lot more after that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> dont make it too formal that he might get scared.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> yes your bestfriend can be your bf but if something goes wrong you lose both!!!!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> Most of sexy guys just want sex not love...
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> OK. you can't make a girlfriend.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> That is to say it's probably not o.k.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I always hear people say Don't do it, your kids will be unhappy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> I think you are ace for giving me 2 easy points  ;)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> Im just curious why this is such a turn on.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Always afraid to do the wrong thing.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> i beat you he wont do it again.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> You said ...if two GIRLS like you...  from your wording, I'm thinking you're pretty young.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> From my own experience dealing with this person I would say NO WAY!!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> if he calls and only wants to hook up for sex
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> your still too young..this will not affect your health whatsoever my dear...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> they always have diffrent ways of see life.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Ask her if she would consider a THREESOME!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> yes give it time and effort but not too much
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> not always satanic, sometimes they're just evil.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> and before we kissed, he would always just go up to me and try to kiss me.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> If u try 2 turn left and he says no i think burger king is the next right
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> but i believe  1st is kissing 2nd is feeling breasts  3rd is feeling vagina /penis 4th is having intercourse
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> sorry dear i missed your name its marie not esther.stop serching 4 love cos youve already found me.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> is she rich an own a bar

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> just ignore him, be nice, it'll piss him off and make u look like the good guy
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> maybe suggest a weekend getaway.. have a family or friend watch the kids.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> The ear has to be VERY clean, or it tastes BAD - eueuue!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> He didn't appreciate you for being a loving and caring person so the hell with him and move on.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> You don't want seconds, do you?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> why did you make out with him and give him head?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> hello i am a 21 year boy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> He loves nice htings - yet doenst like to spend money.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> !and then if he like you he will either say kool or run and ignore you!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> If you didn;t truly love the woman you married, why did you marry her?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> but then agian i drive a beat up truck too.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> But don't be afraid to find out!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Well it depends on if you like her.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> Show them that you care about what they say.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> or an occasional smoker nope they lie on that one to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> yes ,  definitely you would , why?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> I can't believe you would want to take off her dress!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> First tell him not to take it too personal.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Sounds like she did you a favor.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> pull him towaards you so that he knows to get on top.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Hang out at the house, drink and talk about what men have done wrong now.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> now she tells me she has not other way t deal with it.

<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> his lost..thats how u gotta think about it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Hit your penis with a hammer.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Just say Hey, wanna go for a drink, movie, sometime?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Whatever you do - DONT preach to him!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> because im saving myself for when i marry...yuh silly..but you get your answer
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> fun & sex doesnt last forever, but true love does
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> This news is just killing me.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> i like him a lot and hes nice.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> !EVIDENTLY HE DONT WANT U IF HE CHEATING..DUH!!!?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> No I wouldn't worry about it.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> first things first: the kids have to be safe, right?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> encourage your man, and make him feel at ease with taking chances.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> KEEP IT REAL AND JUST SAY IT OR SEND A PEOM OR A CARD!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> No I wouldn't worry about it.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_20> first things first: the kids have to be safe, right?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> encourage your man, and make him feel at ease with taking chances.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> and you know what, you can only lose your virginity once.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> Beleve it or not guys are just as scared to talk as girls are.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> um, how do i know that u r not a pshycho creepy bad person.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> To heck with what anyone else thought.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> You know it's funny, I'm going out with my brothers best friend.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> so yees it will be awkward.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> Beleve it or not guys are just as scared to talk as girls are.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> um, how do i know that u r not a pshycho creepy bad person.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> To heck with what anyone else thought.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> You know it's funny, I'm going out with my brothers best friend.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> this man had a full head of hair in the picture.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> Ugly - yuk - NASTY Some feel like it is a form of art.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> older as he would protect me and he would be comfortable in sex.........
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> But tell them to wait for min.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> You don't set the list, supid slave, she does!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> ok, now if you read my question you might be bothered of me answering yours.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> Keep it at a little, ladies, not a lot!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> so size does matter in some instances.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> you lose control of your bowels... no?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> i dont think they will be affected as much as living in a house full of fights
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Because it wouldn't be love if it didn't hurt...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Flirt wit her and b calm when you do and b friends wit her and then ask her out
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> THEY'RE SHALLOW IF THEY DON'T FIND SINCERITY IN YOUR TRUTH.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> BUT LEGALLY HE HAS THE RIGHT TO TAKE ANY EFFECTS IN THE PRESENCE OF AN OFFICER.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> And she's not doing her job.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> just tell her if you feel comfortable.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Ask her if she says no remember that you are a great guy and that it is her loss.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> His name is Chad and he is supposedly liking me but I don't know... Help me out people!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_55> wat do u mean act right?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> If that is not OK with him say goodbye.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> i wanna take our friendship a noch higher.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> but i am a guy and i have been turned down for being too big.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> It's still hard to afford things but she's doin' alright.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> She is avoiding u, it means she may be in love with some other guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> It's little wonder that I have not married.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> This last week he visited me (as usual) on my boss' day off.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> my husband and i meet on q 106 rock and roll date line.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> you've been running through my mind all night.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> its a tough situation, but you'll be alright in the long run.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> There are not too many civilized women that like that stuff.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> he loves you but he wants dıfferences
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> I just what to keep our love fresh while I am gone.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> if this is the first baby he's probably just scared, and jealous of all the attention you are getting.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> Don't do this to your wife.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> : (  Does anyone have any advice on getting over a breakup?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Hey, half the fun of getting pregnant, is the trying part!
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_25> am 30 and a virgin !!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> i have no clue i never saw a penis...except mine
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> I'm sorry but NO it is not time to PLEASE DO NOT DO IT NOW !!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> i dont see how ethnicity would fit it, so that would be a big no...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> flirt w/her and just be yourself
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Guys also like women who can spell well because we surely can't.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> 21 is quite young to get married.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> By the way, I am a married woman...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Don't do what you don't want to do just to 'be nice' to him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> do you want to check it out?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> it's in their nature 2 b!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> i told her to wear her best dress .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Just don't DO anything that you think you'll regret later.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> Nothing, Girl, you need to back off..
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> But once a cheater-always a cheater.
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_25> get a job and move out.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> maybe like 13 or 14 creepy would be like 11 or 12 and go back
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> NO guy makes his first move, without havin some purpose in mind..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> are you an open homosexual or are you in the closet?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> I CONSIDER MY SELF NORMAL, AND I'M SINGLE.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> if i talk to a guy friend of mine he gets really jealous and pissed off.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> maybe hes just not interested in you anymore

<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> Hey princes where down south r u going to move to and how young r u?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> It seems like so many girls are attracted to guys with peircings and/or tattoos, why is this?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Only you know what's best for you, just be careful.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> what makes you sure he isnt a freek or something.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_40> Then ask her if she'll have sex with you.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> the majority of the time .
<NbChars_270> <LevSim_35> Just get out and move on.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> girl i would say get use to it.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> and I don't know for sure if he does .
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> Remember you married for better & worse!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> If you cannot do this yourself, get help (especially from him).
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> for one he may be super nice or mean to you look for fone numbers follow him
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> oh and the pictures they send.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> try to talk about issues that's really bothering him.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> 6 words: WILL YOU GO OUT WITH ME?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> I still stare at other females but i do it only when my wife is not around.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> call me at 777-adore-me  or e-mail me at(( i'm_god_2_women.heaven.org
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> But like the person above me said.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> what color are you panties, i believe he just wants to get into your pants.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> I feel jealous and when she dont have any value for me...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Two straight guys know that's ANOTHER story!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> yes they are the best match...

<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> share them with me shit I need some cliteris!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> I find the best way to do it is to just tell them...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> but if you cant put up with it then the best thing for you to do is move around.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> They miught not want to chat with you
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> marriage is a big step and it takes alot of give and take.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> it can be if your good bf could be your bestfriend
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> women are looking for thier mr. right and are often fast to jump saying your him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> *other than at a radio sponsered event*
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> of course men cry its natural!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> BUT,IT WILL GET BETTER SOON :0)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> there are a lot of things i want to do but cant because shes there what do i do?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Eat her - trust me it always works!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> There is no way to tell how hard that will hit you until it's too late.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> so i say you chose sides.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> It will drive her insane ..Seriously...She will freak for your body after a good licking
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Yes, but you know that already, don't you.....
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> I dont think you want a normal guy, normal guys are just...NORMAL!!..
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> and lots of people hate me for it.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> Some still like to have a nice guy that does nice things for her, and treats her right.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> IM 21 YEARS OLD AND I HAVE A BABY.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> (providing you are old enough to date).
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> Sex can lead to pregnancy & STD's ( and you can take care of yourself anyway)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> Then treat her like you always did.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> they are wild-er than girls who don't go to church
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> im 18 and i will be the first to say that i don't know what love is.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> i have freinds and they say that they love me but they dont show it, should i believe them?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> See if you can start hanging out with groups of friends.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> So just don't do it,  your risking disease, so just from that don't do it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> tell him that stop going out with his other gril or i will go to my own way!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> !If you whant more advice email meow3994!Thats me!!

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i think that your idea is really nice!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> they think that i'm depressed and crap, but i'm not.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> And one who is fun to hang out with.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> just hang with him and act like you want to be his friend first (if not already true.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> May the force be with you :P
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> (Make it special: Timing is everything as well as how romantic you are!)
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> older men are better...a little more serious,,and thoughtful..plus i think they're better in bed
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> Oh, ooops, half of them will be gay...  just pick and choose carefully.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> he needs to get a small car that is great on gas
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> Don't just miss him becuase he isnt there and you don't have anyone.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> sometimes doesn't pick up his phone that means he's prob cheating.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> it usually depends on the girl though.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> if she says no just like it doesn't bother you.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> Why wouldn't we all be gay!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Stuff like that is always nice.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> invite over a few of your friends!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> You should try to just be like normal and just chill if you want to with him.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> congrats, you made it through puberty with out even going thier.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> Plus......it's always good advice to go to the bathroom before and after sex.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> hey you don't know what the outcome will be until you try it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> i really can't tell you what to do to make him care.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> Miss him becuase you actually being with him
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> because millions of other people have the same question ,,,,
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> u got a same problem like i used to have last year !
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> I would forget him and never do that again!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> i m 17yr girl frm india n next year i m going to do gemnoloy.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> (Like you young girls who have sugar daddies).
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> u got a same problem like i used to have last year !
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> I would forget him and never do that again!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> when you get older you come to the conclusion you have nothing to loose.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> i m 17yr girl frm india n next year i m going to do gemnoloy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I have had pen pals in the past and they've been fun!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> let the guy ask you out
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Why sit around and ponder just do it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> maybe after one year he'll finally get it that you dont wanna go out with him!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_10> UNLESS U GOT BIG BUCKS IF SO CALL A WEDDING PLANNER AND ASK HER FOR IDEAS
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> Sounds like is playing games with the both of you.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_10> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE & ONE MORE TIME LOVE!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> younger men prefer older women, because they think older women are more likely to put out.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> I now this guy i like.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> I just don't know what to do.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Good enough that I do not have to wonder about yours.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> YES IF THEY UNITENTIOANLLY DO SOMETHING TO ME AND NO IF THEY PURPOSELY DID ME WRONG
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> and you cant even fight back, cause you can't hit a girl.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Just be confident and whats the worse tha t could happen him say no?!?!?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> Since you gave him head without any kind of commitment, you pretty much set yourself up.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> I liked girls, and guys too.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> I think they did it on brady bunch...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> at the sametime listen and talk about his intrests .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> Have you ever herd the saying  he that findeth a wife findeth a good thing?
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_45> they want to be verry noughty or have (sex)
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> ture love has no time table.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> explain it is ok to tell you what she needs to get to that stage.man she is missing out!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> are you the wierd one or what?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> try and find a good woman
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Still he said it was nothing.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Hell, just do the wrong thing, and joke with them about it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> This is a good thing, not a problem!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> when you together do you feel her and she feels you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> do not take part in it
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I don't mind if a guy comes up to talk to me.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> tell him bye NOW and forget him bad  bad boy no good for you
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> make then accept you for who you are
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> If he loves you then it is smooth sailing after tht right?
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_45> 9 yrs is a long time!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> he acts like he likes me.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> He would know it if he wasn't.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> If nhe is flirting then yes.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> Go to a strip club and get a prostitute
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> a bit unique, but not wierd.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> you probably wont untill you meet him in person.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> he's just grabbin all the     s he can--a casanova, a player, a jerk!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> i want him back but i dont know what 2 do
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I like to go perfume shopping with my guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i know it sounds hard to do at school but it really is the best thing to do.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> maybe its a selfessteem issue, where they think that they are better off just stickin with the thug-types.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_15> MAYBE YOU ARE BEING BLIND IN YOUR LOVE..
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_30> to do what he probably wants to do.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> i hate thugs i like classic men
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> don't ask those sort of things.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> try rubbing her shoulders then get her to lie down so u can massage her back.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> good luck and keep your chin up!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> but doyou like him in a way that you would want to have a relationship with him?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> I was so upset that i cried.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> ok i KNOW how u feel.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> if the only way you can get out is to leave everything, then do it!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> I used to lock the bathroom.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> so u never know just be careful is all.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> is will you want it once you get it ?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> I would have to ask WHY is she in Plano Tx.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> My ex hates my guts, but I still like her.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> if the guy/girl only calls you to **** you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> i mean, hes human just like u, waht u gota be afraid for?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> both of you are so nice :)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> As Long as she dosen't find out...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> well im 13 so im a little young 4 you.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> always keep your phone messages cleared and try not to let them all meet at the same place,,.....lol
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> Come on, honestly what did you expect?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> hon, by the way you spell annoying i can tell that this is just a high school love.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> do you think hes playin or hes really into me?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> but all women have one thing in comman, and thats how they want romance.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> We're not that scary you know.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> let me give you a child's perspective.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> that has a lot to do with it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> I guess it would just depend on the kids!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> If that cant be done (I know how that goes!)
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> and your not even close yet to the woman you will become.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> Cave man #1: Ug, I feel this whole survival thing is blown way out of proportion these days.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> he says he cant help how he feels.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> He said he only talked to her once.But, I don't know if I believe that.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> for all u know, she's been dying to ask you out too.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> Oh and when you go...there will be ALOT of chapel owners outside trying to get your business...LOL!!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> If he doesnt notice you then its because hes not for you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> e-mail me : livinlifeintheoc@yahoo.com then i can give u a better answer
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> but dont have sex  with man at the first day
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> No, choose the Flying Spaghetti Monster.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Then after time I want some one new  why?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> Bradey Bunch, hell, watch the rat patrol, you almost have a squad.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_20> CALL HIM AS OFTEN AS HE SAYS YOU SHOULD OR CAN.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_10> YOU CAN GO 2 CHAT ROOMS LISTINGS AND THERE U WILL HAVE ALOT OF ROOMS 2 CHOSE FROM.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> Maybe he does OR he just wanted your number!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> I mean, girls do it all the time.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> Or say I have found someone else!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> We had a blast in Vegas!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> you should probably tell her or dont give him any attention back.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> and you want both of them to be happy together.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> BUT we are good friends now.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> if the guy likes her  and not u then u have to  accept it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Ha ha, that guy above me is too funny!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> If you love her, then ask if she loves you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> i was hard, as always when i'm wif here.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> you just have to be confident, and be yourself.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> it's you that makes your life lonely.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> because women are insecure and are in need of it all the time.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> best thing to do is just say hello and tell her your name.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> get rid of him before he dumps you!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> !no he is too old and biside he does not love u he only instreded in ur body
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> features like good shape, complaction, colour of the eyes and so on.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> He loves nice htings - yet doenst like to spend money.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> try to wait if you can still work it out together.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> HAVING A BABY CAN BE VERY STRESSFUL AND TIRING.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> let me tell you something family is forever.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> that's what i call a basket-ful o' goodies =) lol
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Stop watching it for 6 months and then try it agian;)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> naughty in the bedroom nice everywhere else
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> go for the fancy and if she wants it, let her order the friggin lobster.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> maybe that u like the person?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> Boyz come a dime a dozen but friendships are hard to come by....FOOD FOR THOUGHT....
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> It's not that he doesn't love u or wanna be with u.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> let her go because she never lıkes and she plays both of you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> because some girls wants to fall in love all mens.especially handsome people
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> (And I especially don't want that particular physical trait growing on me!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> its what my former girlfriend always uses..and it always works!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> how can i make my mind contole me ?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> i am 15 and i love to go to the movies with boys.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> she may not even be there and just left a false clue.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> needs your support & understanding right now.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> if you agree to your self then you can do that i dont think its okay good luck
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> well if hes good to you i think it's fine
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> if u answer the questions with positives answers then theres a probobility u r in love so good luck
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> but I made something of myself .
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> yeah if you want to end up with an old lady or fat man..
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> * if a man really likes you......you will know!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Then I read an email hed sent to a women talking about love.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> maybe hint it out to him that you really would like to kiss him.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> they feel something and don't know what it is.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Only the ones you meet in vampire bars and covens.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> alredy did but anyways here it is s.j.thefinest@yahoo.com
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Depends on who I am with.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> That way you're not completly cutting her off.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> )and make sure not to flirt alot.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Most of the time I'm just nervous that the girl doesn't like me and its all in my head.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> when you invite problems, you'll have problems
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> you won't get any when the baby' here.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> How do you realy like(love) your boyfriend?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> As far as your frenz ex...ask yourself...which is more important...your FRIENDSHIP with her or trying to date this guy????
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> No matter how much it hurt, he wouldnt stop.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Don't blame her, but use I statements like, I desire to make love with you.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> Or maybe I suck at making bf.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> you should be more worried about not being gay.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> If you're not married then NO.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> if he's not into you, then just give up.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Well it really depends what you mean by look.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> flatter her alot coz zat is all women week point
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> cover it up and have fun...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> Just make it seem like it is not a date, but just hanging out.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> i'll probably go and see one.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> 18 or after aimancipation (however u spell it) or have ur parents sign a document
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> He will be jealous if you talk or flirt with other guys.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> trying to pick which guy when your husband goes on deployment.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> I busted my butt for the ERA and some dumb girl asks a stupid question like this.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> my dad says they dont have any, its a secret...??
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> go back to wemen that shit anit right anyway
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_40> i want to hear ur side
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> if you can not reestablish trust then it's never gonna work.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> Picnic at the beach or park - buy a pre-cooked chicken meal at the grocery store.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_30> I'm not going to say it's o.k.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> dont feel alone, sometimes its just not nessary
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Sometimes things workout, and sometimes they don't....that's life.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> However, have you ever thtought that maybe, just maybe, you two just are not good for one another.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> or just have to stop thinking about them?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Maybe they just don't want to lose you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> if you mean a date, then yes.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> it is a homework assignment due tomorrow
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> no its not weird i didnt date anyone until i was 19 in college and now i'm 22.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> Problem is that I can't tell if guys like it or...not.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> So it's been great for them!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Every time you catch his eye...SMILE!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> you ask her to marry you
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> so it wont matter what you say, they wont be interested.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Lately all I've wanted to do was sleep...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> I GUESS IT'S NOT A QUESTION.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> You got yourself a real winner.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> Be creative with yourself, fall in love with YOU first!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Talk to him and ask him if he wants to hang out some time.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> There is not really a way of do in it u just do it.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> And she might feel the some way about you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> (at least that's how it is in CA)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> You just have to be patient and wait for them to get here.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> get back on that bike bro.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Deep down she really does want you to pay.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> AND IF WE DIDN'T SCREAM YOU WOULD THINK WE WERE SLEEPING!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> you'll be glad you did in the long run.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> how should i tell my ex that i dont want he no more?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> Hey Whats up i guess it starts to know what u are lookin for?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> hes not in love with you, hes in love with the control over you.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> and when he do that act like how he was acting.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> but if you find out that all he wants is sex then i think you should dump him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT CALL HIM EVERY FIVE MINUTES OR A BILLION TIMES IN ONE DAY.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> what do women like about men?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> the greatest of these is love
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> If not, he is selfish...scram...your headed for trouble!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> i kinda feel that what you want is someone to tell you exactly what to do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> how about grab your mistresses @ss day.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> there is this guy at my school and i cant tell if he likes or even notices me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> cut your lose i hate to say it but... he likes another girl
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> not sure it'd work...but u could try it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> To spice your sex life with your wife  please add some salt and pepper ton her pussy and enjoy
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> yes, because usually they have to give it up.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> Thank you & always remain yourself !!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Now if he does try to just get in bed with you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> moving on to the sex part of it.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> i'm with you the same thing happing with me.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> let them know that u want alittle freedom

<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> And my then fiance(now husband) and I just drove to Las Vegas and got married.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> Be confident - but not cocky.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> How about being a KID first???
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> do not get A BOY FRIEND on the internet....he could BE A RAPIST!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Life is short, go out & live it up!!!!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> You should not be doing that to your sis and your ex.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> if not well then thats just crazy but at least you tried.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> There's many out there, trust me :)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> BOTH TRUST ME I WAS NAUGHTY & NICE.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> for me hitting the club hacing fun all night.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Plus now I chase him around the house tons more.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> i dunno but i know what you mean!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> but i don't want to do it derect
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> you can tell millions of people you like a guy but you can't tell him?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> So that 22 to 27 thing,  eh, they are fun for recreational sort of sport f .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> i not sure myself..i really want to know how myself...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if it's not an exclusive relationship...
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> If he is taken and is happy, then move on.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Will she ever feel how I felt?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> she said it a nice way that made me realize my wrong doing.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> Ya need to get to your gyno.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> BUT other than that - you are beautiful and talented, if I may guess - MOVE ON!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> i'm embarressed by my parents too.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> and your future partner, if not believing in it himself, should not force you to do anything.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> nobody believs u. u dont even know who i am.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> You do not build a relationship starting with sex trust me
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> He's really nice, but we aren't that close.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> depends on how old you r.. if your like yonge go to a movie or something.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> Its ok if you dont know about sex.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> first yu have to change yr sex apple towords him .
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> choosing a partner, i have no experience in.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> Or should I just go ahead and try it for the hell of it?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> I love sex because it's so much fun!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Hey there ham-sandwich, how are you today?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> But some guys would do that...   WHY?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> help me no drivers licens and hard worker what next?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> He treated her like crap and she is dumb for wanting him back.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> None of them probably do and he needs to find someone who does.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> You need to be careful what you are subcommunicating there...   Also are you ok with always paying?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> so maybe you should try to talk to your boyfriend.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> alway's remember to pick your battles.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> I have meet some really bad kissers in my life.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> leave him alone if he really loved you he wouldn't still be with his wife
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> get another man and move on
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> what kind of help would you like
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> the first time I saw his green eyes!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> It was cold and u didnt heat it up... ;-)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> we went from having sex 10x a week to zero.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> if you don't feel comfortable adjust and then proceed.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> but trust me he'll be back especially if it was good to him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> How much do you like (love) your boyfriend?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> don't choose just for the cruise line...choose for the ports of call
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> when your kissing and she let you touch where ever you want
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> well its been my experience a large wallet can offset a small penis so size does matter
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> If you have nice eyes and awesome hair, I am already head over heels!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_20> is a good start, and sincere not cocky.....
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> You gotta take care yourself first.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> legally u have 2 be 18 and over.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> unless she gives u a reason not to otherwise.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Do they Like girls at that age??
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_55> My wife would get upset with me if I didn't date Beyonce when I had the opportunity.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_35> try to do more listening than talking.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> How it is going to help, if you cry the whole day and still you feel sad!!!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> lol  AS soon as you want.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> i guess if he dosent change even if it hurts we have to leave them.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> I'm just like any other male:  I am obsessed with it; why else have I seen her naked?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> You can flirt and make it obvious that you like him.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> tell him too tell you other wise its over that always works
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> Hello .. Maybe it is just me !
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> I don't think that makes you gay though.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> just ignore him if he talks 2 u, and spread bad rumors about him
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> sure is there a guy interested in a friendship?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> but then it IS to late
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> If there's no kids to think of HELL NO
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_35> So go ahead and tell him everything that u r thinking.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Plus you young girls are looking for older men or men with potential .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> no comment... if you both like each other then go as long as no one gets hurt....ok?
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_15> I feel for you, good luck
<NbChars_315> <LevSim_10> WELL DARLING, IM A MARRIED WOMAN.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> because in reality, the 'popular' girls aren't popular at all.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> What would be the point of Liking a girl??
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> CAN YOU FIX A CAR BY YOURSELF?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> Have you ever heard of RedBook?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> If all you guys do is have sex.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Its like fighting demons every day when you wake up.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> how can i find really free friend finder site?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> He gets girls pg, then moves on.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Oh yeah, you are very normal!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> focus on her... take your time,massage is nice,warm up your oil..and a hot towel...no music,or talking,just action...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> cause he is a really sweetheart, ans means the world to me.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> my little sister is constantly wanting to b up my ass everywhere i go she wants to be there.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> nothing...if u like him...and he likes u...there is nothing to fix.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> there is nothing wrong being a virgin at 19!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> there's nothing to be shy about.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> no no no save yourself until marriage, give your husband a special gift.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Just like u would any other woman.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> If u can't find one out of house try to find one by chatting...ok?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> theres not a whole lot you really can do.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> IF HE LOVES YOU HE WILL CHANGE.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> but i can't forget my ex-gf coz i love her & i'm in dilemma.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> Or...she could just be really in love with you.
<NbChars_350> <LevSim_25> It's time to shut him down.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> I scream because my boyfriend asked me to.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> is it to be cool in front of friends or its just the way they are
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> Save the good stuff for later.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> do NOT get married until u find ur soulmate!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> nothing better than strange, its the thing I miss most since I got married.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Yup...it depends on what type of wedding you want.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> talk about your intrests, and ask her about hers.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> men are jerks by definityion and love is a destroyer by its usage.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> Go to a club and have one hell of a time!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> king,  but the mind at 28 and the woman is ready for a relationship.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> when the lump in his pants keep knocking things off the tables.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> 1st base - kissing 2nd base - making out with 'touching' 3rd base - eh... sex.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> But if you don't that is fine too.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> If after 8 mothes he's willing to cheat it wont last.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> Not easy to do I know.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> And ma st er ba ti on is not a dirty word!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> if  your both single talk with him about those feeling  he may be having same type feeeling
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> Why don't you go after a not-so-good-lookin guy and you won't have that problem.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> take me out old school  KABLAM
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> he mite unless he has a girlfriend
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if you are not over your ex you should not be getting married.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> IF YOU WANT TO DATE SOMEONE WHO IS 1 OR 2 YEARS OLDER THEN YOU THEN GO FOR IT.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> try to start your lives over little at a time, i belive these things shouldnt be rushed.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> if u like u can make that day or give it a date
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> i have been in situations like this from middle school up to college...and it never gets easier.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_10> BECAUSE MAYBE THEIR JEALOUS AND ITS OKAY TO BE SOMETIMES.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> She asked if we could still be friends.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> and my mom would kill me if she found out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> for the first time in past 10 years (i think so).
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> day after thanksgiving, i went to this guy's house for a party.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> This guy, I swear it would be so right, but i feel like I'm only 14..it can't be.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Ohh wait YOU ARE NOT A MAN!!!!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> I don't mean anyting by it either.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> And she is actually happier now that both her parents are happy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> I went out with this guy last week.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> him b in charge of wat topics u talk about.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> i mean, come on, is tehre a reson NOTto like sex?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> love is something you feel, not what you think.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> well i guss it depans of what website your on if its good or not.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> There are too many good ones out there to waste your time on someone you already wasted time on!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> i like to know more about female ejaculation
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> ...and i just want a relationship...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> People never win games, they alway loose in the end.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Then he gets an attitude when I say that men re like children
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> my boyfriend is bi and so it's perfect for me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> but these things cannot b rush into or it will end up like hell on earth.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> do i have a reason to hope?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> and hey if u believe in Jesus?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> I cant speak for other woman but I sure as hell never do/did.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> they have been best friends seens first grade now were in 7grade .
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> a lil help would b appreciated.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> plus give yourself a stepping stone .
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> boobs 38dd and plus.any age 16 to 99
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> 1:Ur doing exactly what ur not supposed to be doing……that’s why u feel that way….….
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Well 2 wrongs don'tmake it right!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> go to a massage parlor and ask for the happy ending-doing that once a week should help
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> other than that if your both consentual have all the sex you want.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> i think thugs are creepy and unattractive!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> its the hottest peak of sex,the moment that u feel u own the world!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> he invited me to come over so i did.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> By cutting him off from my life?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> its totally unattractive to me, when you have that stank breath i dont want it anywhere near me.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> If you have any guy friends left bro.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> the meds balance them out and everything is just fine.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> What cologne do you like most on a guy?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> just kidding be yourself and be nice to him
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> were all afraid to admit something!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> If she truly hates you: Who knows?
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> I love her very much and i want her to know how much she means to me.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_35> I was just lucky that their was no cops around for the ride home.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> It is so okay for guys to cry.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> she had taken her panties off.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> It started with small talk then lead to more personal stuff like, am I married?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> I tod him tht I wouldn't have sex with him until I was 16 or 17.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> when someone , gives gifts or flatter a girl
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> if he is your best friends bf and he flirts with you he isnt that good of a guy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Just enjoy yourself a little bit longer.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> I KNOW IM YOUNG AND MIGHT THINK I DONT KNOW MUCH BUT I DO.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> you have to be kidding me.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> I mean how old are you?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> chances are its in her mind u just have to bring it out.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> Also, you could just say, do you wanna got to Starbucks?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Then if he is, talk to him a little.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> honey, i think we're gonna need a little more info on that one!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> If you have some REAL problem with the guy ... you should tell your mom about it
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> this is not the place to post such silly questions here
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> Lol, I guess I get to sit back and see what happens to her?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> give him an poster of einstien and a card!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_60> opinions from both males and females
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_30> Wait until you are 35 lol.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> But you have needs, don't you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> what i have found is that men just have different ways to show they care.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Wish her to a have a 'GREAT day!.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> he always gives me hugs,talks to me,he even flirts with me.but the thing is hes my best friends boyfriend!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> :)  The devil's going to rip you a new lifestyle, everytime.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> quit looking for it, it will find you when you least expect it :)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> i think im not am i dunno why ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> you don't get her to like you .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Well then go back to your ex bf, and try to work things out together,
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> my live-in boyfriend is finally going to be divorced in 2 days!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> I go spend all my summers and christmas vacation time there with him.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> girls are cheaters dont trust them....if they said i really loves u....means they wants to play with ur life...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> im guessin its to make her feel good about herself.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> ( I'm not talking about playing hard to get).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> tell him...hey i heard that there is this good burger joint in the mall.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> in a year you probably wont even like him any more.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I don't care how attracted I am to him.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_10> THE RIGHT PERSON CAN FIX ANYTHING.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Women buy sex toys because: 1. they last as long as u want them to.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> airplane bathroom it was the best i've ever had my first time actually
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> Don't it always seem to go, that you don't know what you've got til it's gone?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Trust me I've been there done that sweetie!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> does it have buttons or a zipper?
<NbChars_40> <LevSim_20> But i wouldn't do anything until then because karma always comes back.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> hhhmmmmm.... i'm blushing right now thinking of it >:)... hehehehe
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_10> STOP POSTING POINTLESS STUFF ON MY QUESTIONS GROW UP.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> people will say yes and some will say no.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> does it have buttons or a zipper?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> But i wouldn't do anything until then because karma always comes back.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_35> hhhmmmmm.... i'm blushing right now thinking of it >:)... hehehehe
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> STOP POSTING POINTLESS STUFF ON MY QUESTIONS GROW UP.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> people will say yes and some will say no.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> no that dont mean that he is cheating if you trust him then dont worry about his passwords.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> If you want a romantic relationship.... well.... you get the idea.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_10> AND NO DONT CHEAT BECAUSE THAT WILL ONLY MAKE THINGS WORSE.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> yet he still, to me, acts like a guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> but it is worth the trouble.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> u r gift from heaven 2.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> like kissin, touchin, i wouldnt say sex then,cuz i think that would be too soon.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> i want to enter a magic site but it asks me this question
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> But he is getting married this month.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_50> Be interested even if you're not.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> yeah if you want to get a divorce!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> kissing agood looking girl is like...?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> well, find out how he acts around you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> No Dear u didnt do right.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> get him a magazine subscription to something he likes.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> because you deserve better than that.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> but he still cant get away from you because hes in love.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> HOWEVER----i find him looking at me every now and then.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> my best friend has a major crush on him,and im only 13-i dont want a boyfriend yet!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> I have experienced something like this...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Dont change yourself just for a guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> when i met him he was lucky if he had 2 hairs left.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> thats okey as long as you are over 18 i guess.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Because you won't have sex with him and he might try to rape you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I feel weird when i saw him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> well yes um usually the boys dont want to be younger then the girls.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> IT WILL HAPPEN WHEN YOU LEAST EXPECT IT TO.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Love you but not in love with you!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> Women donot think about gay men at all.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> But u do out and have fun as well.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> but there is no intamacy or romance left.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> first u should see if he has changed and is loyal.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> i do this now about every outher month .
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> Last year, I bought my ex- sexy pajamas and chocolate body paint.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> im going though the same thing and need someone to talk to!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Not all men are like children, perhaps just your.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> preppy girls like the sports car, but most girls it wouldn't matter.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't give up on her and your kid.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> and list what qualitys you want.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> its what you feel comfortable with.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> tell him what I want and like Buger King, I have it MY WAY!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> They only scream when you are raping them
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> and then just fallow your heart.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> He is in love with me and wants to marry me when I become 19.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> in some cases these ladies become sugar mommas .
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Just know how valuable YOU are...not things!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> this happens all the time .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> There are so many nice people out there and remember this....things always happen for a reason.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> because most people are having sex more often than they travel
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> no you should just try to accept it.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_40> Honey, 14 is way too young.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Its called Valentines Day, because Valentines Day sure isn't for the guy.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> soft is a sign life, ridgidity is a sign of death.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> hint at it then if they dont get it just come out and tell them
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> It's just too bad that women feel that way these days.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> depends of who you are with i wouldnt call any names to my girl
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> my grandparrents hav a 10 year difference in age!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> try 2 give me more detail....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> most of the people are sex starve  or sick men from india and all those other countries around there
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Doesn't have to be boy, doesn't have to be     !
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> just get right out there and tell her.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> cuz we can be and u men giv in easily
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> get a lawyer and go for half of everything else!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> What a waste of a perfectly good young man.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Is it wrong of me to bring up his girlfriend again??
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> you gave him head with no strings attached
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> If I could chose only one ???
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> if this makes you popular, then that's that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Only looking for her will find her, asking around yahoo isn't going to get her found...Nicky
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> OKAY THAT ALL DEPENDS ON AGE.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> I don't know how he feels, and its driving me crazy!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> its lust then may go to love
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> There's definitely no age limit...if you find true love when you're young, then that's awesome!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> dating beyonce any day, any time.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> tell him to go over there and get cleaned up.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> wait a minuet isnt proposing like asking to marry and doesnt spouse mean husband or wife?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> In these 5 yrs i never dated anyone.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_10> REALIZE SHE ADMIRES YOU THATS WHY SHE DOES THAT, ITS A COMPLIMENT, ENJOY IT.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> whoever's hotter and got better tips that night
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> He is probably gay and is trying really hard to like girls but just can't.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> leave space to write down his suggestions too.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> what do u feel when his around?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> if you dont then guess what you are F**k !
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> someone who like u for u and not for wut u got
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> if you can go to another state, even better.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> and has a urge to have sex and mess around.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> plus there is a whole nother issue that you don't seem to see.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> if you dont want a committment also, then fine.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> No matter what guy you like you can like Green Day and they don't have to like it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> like if something was wrong with them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Work on the two of you first.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Don't worry about it - you have PLENTY of time!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_25> All men are not jerks, just the one you wanted.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> if you are able to do that .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> as the old saying gose try it you might like it best of luck
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> they haven't even had the time to figure out what love is.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> or you'll get your heart broken.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_20> although we've talked about it alot ,i still dont know his reasons.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> you don't want to fight for a guy who is not sure of you and what he wants.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> why some thing like this occupcying your mind ?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> As for him you shouldn't really  worry about it until he gets out of hand.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> There is a lot to be happy about!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> I just don't want it to be just a card and I have not ideas.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> I wanted to have sex with him soooooo badly.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> If you need to ask you are already sucked in.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> i know the obvious answer that many are probably thinking, if he loves you then you will be fine.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> I was on my own .
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> Avoid negatives like, I can't believe I'm doing this or I'm lonely so I'm trying this out.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> That way you both have a chance at life.
<NbChars_260> <LevSim_25> why don't you look for a real man?
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_25> You say...Babe you know what....I Love ya
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_25> its normal.they're human.But please dont cry for something stupid ;)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> things get said and people get hurt.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> Thats pretty much the relationship I have with my wife.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> you got to hit him where it hurts(don't hit him forreal)(its just a figure of speech).
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> Do a lot of kissing and alot of stroking.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> I say don't go to the wedding.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> Take your time...dont' grow up too fast.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> and besides what woman wouldn't want a guy that can make her laugh?
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> if anything is password protected they are hiding something
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> she just wants to be around you is all
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> in a very nice sweet kind of way!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> do you think i should ask him out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If so just talk to the guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Men can cry like any human being!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> i like him to be taller than me, honest but not too nice.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> that just means they occasionaly misplaced their wallet and have to wait to get that pack till later.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> Coming from another Wise,get rid of his butt!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> he handed me his cellphone and had me put in my phone number.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> That way, both of you get a chance to do what you want.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> put urself and get down the buttom of the problem
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> Men do not like insecure girls well most do not.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> dont know how to speak english?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> What the hell would have happened if I said she smelled like shit?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> Is it what we thought it was?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> treat her like a queen everyday, it's enough
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> The curb: kick him there ;)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> go fo wht eva she wnts
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> If you are creative, just make out little coupons with ideas like: One Free Date.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> & I just had my first child 14 mos.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> are you watching too much p..n ????
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> or, that you don't feel like it anymore.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> I think its a matter of YOU reaching the g spot, deary :)
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> all of that for the grand slam!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> We got a guy around here like that.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> And for some coutries this is a big NO NO...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> I knew a girl that was old fashioned once .... she's an old maid now!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> see if you can jion her and her mate
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> be like the nicky comercials Just do it cuz foreal?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> and kissing an aguly girl is like ...?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> I don't understand women these day's trying to feel bad about a guy buying them lunch.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> when she is not expecting it or is down.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Last time he said it was because he was working alot.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Be her friend (that is most imporatant) and see where it goes
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> If he keeps glancing at you!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Just take your time and dont rush into anything:-)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> If you have to ask ... you just know.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> it's not easy but it's for the best.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> it is just the demon in your mind.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> the best way to get a girl.. be orginal, be funny, and most important of all be confident.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> you should have said:A HOT  SINGLE LATINO HAS ARRIVED FOR ONE LUCKY  HOT LADY, hurry!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> this little thing that they have is called their ego.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> its been a while since ive thought of this im 40 y.o.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> If she hates it, she's too  high maintenance for ya.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> yeah.it softens ur problem  and it makes u breath as it is.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> Don't waste your time trying to catch him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> simple, stop looking, it always seems to work that way.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> then based on this you can draw your conclosion
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> he can always pick on u. and he can always want 2 be around u.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_25> Plus if you go classy then she'll expect that all the time!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> im 23 and a grad student presently.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> if your gonna make the move make sure its ok with them too.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> It's not something to rush into, it's more of a do it at your own pace sort of thing.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> ?do you think i am hot?by my avatar?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> Read Cosmopolitan, they have great stuff in there for spicing up your  sex life.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> don't insult because your frustrated unless you want him to do the same.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> ask him on a date, tell him u like him......see where it goes from there
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Maybe you DO have a DUH type of guy .Sorry if thats the case...
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> Sounds like stage fright to me.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> or not true at all) thats how im trying to get my man too.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> *sounds of cringing from the rest of the bar*
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Sounds like stage fright to me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> I was one of those super shy guys ...  Take my advice, kiss him.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> or not true at all) thats how im trying to get my man too.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> *sounds of cringing from the rest of the bar*
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> why not, if you dont take chances in life you'll never get somewhere :-)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> i'm 25 and i like you
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> It seems like i was cheated.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Try to sleep it off - no, only kidding.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> be yourself and be nice to her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> When realised, we dont mind calling it as love at first sight ...
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> Just say OK let's get this out there, you and me are not happening, we cool?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> well... if you really like him.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_55> sorry man but hope u find someone
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> no big deal to you now but imagine when your 25, 30!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> if she chooses you, good for you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> You want someone that likes similar things...be it horseback riding, watching football, or whatever.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> kids are 17 19 21 years old
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_15> YOU DID RIGHT AND THAT IS CHEATING!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> If he makes fun you he just isn't worth it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> u knew her boyfriend was jealous and u covered for her.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_25> Another way is to dress sexy, NOT slutty, but not boring either.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> there r some of us left in the world u just have to look harder
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_25> Get himself a 19 year old girlfriend!
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_25> SOrry, but theres things that just can't help.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> huni if he is as you say do you really want tpo be just another tick on his list!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> for stress relief (trying to be clean).
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Generally, he gets much more sleep!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> escpecially if they like that girl.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> hun there's nothing wrong with you.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> because he seeing you have he said it is over .
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Go single for a while, think your priorities out and then go fishing :-)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> if u think he is cheating come straight out him and ask u just have to ask.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> by the way he looks at me.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_35> call me, call me now, let's talk.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> you would make a great friend
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Like the lady on top said it's very hard
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> when young men try to date girls their age .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Guys don't hide as much as girls.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> like find your email addres or your phone number.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> good luck because you are going to need it
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> ?and tell him he knows him very well!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> he had to of taken that picture like 20 years ealier.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> tell her you want to get help with her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> i dont know if i gained anything in love but i lost my dear friend :(
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> Plus, I've had guys hate my perfume, and stop hugging me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> you don't want to worsen the matter.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> alot of my friends are going for this, but i am still goin with the rockers and surfer/skater types.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> let him fly but keep the thread in ur hand.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> NO, yes, maybe, I don't know, this question upsets  me, (where are my meds).
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> it was getting late and i fell asleep in his living room.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> There are very young girls out there just like me!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> well this is a hard ans.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> okay one of my good friends is 15 years old and use to cut herself.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Let her know how much you care and find little ways to keep showing it to her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> ?whats the use of being a rich man if u feel alone and unwanted?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> I care about this man, but I need some suggestions on how to tell him, I can not breath.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Well nothing unless you want him back.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> so that way you won't feeel that yopu have to do everything.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> actually you don;t have to get married.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> it was not even enough for a comb over.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> you can always talk to a counselor near where you live...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> let him know u as a person.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> and this guy tony obviously has no respect for u. just stay with the one u love!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> the yare tring to feel better for themselves.because they feel like shit
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Tell the guy you have a crush on him.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> and she the girls likes you, it wouldn't matter to her, anyways
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> maybe if theyre lucky enough, but i dont think they do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> my sister and her boyfriend have done it for a year now and they are happy.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> bcuz they're wankers and life someting from another world 4 them (the ones who want sex bla bla bla...)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> simply he likes u and wana to knows u more than now..
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> stop looking so hard, they're right around you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> and is my x wife realy sick and how sick is she
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> A nice dinner at home, or a walk in the park, a full body massage from you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> that is 1 to 2 people a year you have sex with.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> if you were a straight man ?!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> they just dont think like us women!!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_15> CAN U GIVE ME Ur E-MAIL ADRESS??
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> was i wrong, Or what should i say  thanks
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> GETTING MAD AND ACTING LIKE JERK WONT HELP EITHER.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> does he look at you in the eyes?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> eat up and dive in......that usually works for me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he then asked me, can i come with you?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> don't ask me i am a girl but my bro lives in d.c.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> When i set my eyes @you!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> even if you decide to part company.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Just the eyes and nothing else
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Because the fact that ur asking this question is cuz u feel guily.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> how do u feel ur in love with someone it's r u in love or not?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> an yeah see a gyno if you are a girl to rule out anything.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> you dont want a young girl.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> I REALLY LOVE THE OLD FASHION WAY: WHITE & LIGHT PINK, BUT PINK 7 VIOLET WORKS TOO
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> it also encurages him, (oh, ok she's luaghing at my joke, i'm not blowing this thing after all!)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> CALL THE FAMILY TOGETHER,HAVE A GREAT DINNER.THEN HAVE HER FAVORITE DESERT MADE OR BOUGHT,PUT THE RING IN THE DESERT.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> Brittany Murphy, I really like her
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> act shitty with him, ignore him like he did you, make him feel stupid.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> What sort of look is it?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> :o  Ok, hope that helped you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> if you can deal with him flirting with other girls then hey i guess that it is fine.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> If you can't find anything you're interested in, then it probably won't work and I don't have anymore advice.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> maybe u are looking to hard for someone who is exactly the same as the woman u dated.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> more like what is she smoking.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> What if business goes well, and romance goes bad.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> My wife snuck on and wrote that, I think she tries to pretend like I'm not a fat boy...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> You need to feel her out...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> KEEP IN MIND NO ONE KNOWS THAT I AM GAY.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> guys have problems with girls because they tend to get nervous.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> ask him by striking a conversation up wiht him!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> but when he do deside to get his ass off his shoulder.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> tell them you fear for your safety.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> Dress nice and flirt with him, give him your attention.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i always get confused about that?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> Then, I found out that he only had the email addresses and what not of women.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> or i need to buy something at the mall.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> I did not like it either when I had to let them run my life during school.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> but don't bend over backwards to become what you're not.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_40> tell him exactly waht you told us....you care but you need your space!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> they starve themselves, and talk about nothing at all, exept who had sex with who.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> you havee lost your virginity by mastubation
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> Girl only you can decide on this...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> try asking him and say why that bothers you.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> must make me laugh...and i agree a good butt is always nice 2 lol
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> because we know what we want and are not to budge.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_45> Well do it based on the same evidences that make women say men are stupid, fools ot have nofeelings!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> i think you should not be doing that cause sooner or later he is going to hurt you!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> when people get drunk things happen
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Awesome ... but it takes work to keep it that way.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> (what if he's creepy AND cute?!)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> No attraction, no connection...so how do you just say, it's over?
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> And you should cry, let it out.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Meanwhile these guys spend little or no money on them and get all the action they need .
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Once a cheater always a cheater.... if he does this to his girlfriend, he'll do it to you.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_35> try some toys and movies make it kinkieeee
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> i dont think astrology is real.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> GET A JOB AND BE INDEPENDENT........ thats simple..... i been living Independent since i was 16.. now im 21
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> If she rejects ya then whatever theres a gazillion other fish in the sea you don't need her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> But Mainly -  FOLLOW YOUR HEART and YOUR GUT FEELINGS !!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> Jus relax and don't ask too many questions Tip:wear B.O.D.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> ask her first then if she does not get off  push her off
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> And chicks with 'richards' sort of scare me too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> YOU JUST HAVE TO FIND THEM.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> well it is talking of virginity.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> No i don't think so, but i'm worried myself about not having one and i'm 13 too.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> :P I don't practice what I preach.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Plus it's a great excuse to hold a woman close, even strange women!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> ASKE HER WHAT SHE THINKS, HOW SHE FEELS.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> do u think about the guy?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> well i dun...I'll for real life experience wen im old enough..
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Then just go up to her and start talking.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> Have you asked him if he is or if he realy likes you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> I GUESS I JUST ALWAYS THOUGHT WE'D GET BACK TOGETHER SOMEDAY.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> If it fails, just let it go...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Do what you got to do to make yourself happy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> he has 3 teenagers she has 3 teenagers all 6 are good kids
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> but just remeber that it will get easier.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> get yourself out there so people can see you and get to know you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> We are friends but i really want to go out with her!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> need more info my yahoo screen name is oletennesseanchic17
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> talk to him about it instead of us!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> Ditch 3 of them & spend time alone w/ the one you like lol
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> JUST LIVE YOUR LIFE, SET YOUR GOALS AND DO UNTO OTHERS AS YOU WOULD HAVE THEM DO ONTO YOU.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> If you really want a divorce get one.

<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> go on to a online dating thing
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> perhaps he was going to get around to it, perhaps not.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> Maybe you should ignore her because she will just hurt you if you care about her.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> guys goin' out w/ not so better looking or unpopular girls only happen in movies..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> just be yourself.believe me it works.goodluck
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> he gently massaged my back and hugged me again.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> y is that some guys dont have the guts 2 tell a gurl how they fell about her?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> And if you realy love her then you two should think about going to counceling together.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> i'm being myself and i LOVE my life!!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> But to someone else, I mean.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> i guess we are more mature.yes it does suck!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just stay straight lol its much easier!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> if you do, get out of it fast!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> I'ts fun seeing what he likes.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> the problem is this: if he cares about you at all, he's going to be apprehensive.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> need help ill give u advice if u e-mail me.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> I'm still in love with my baby's father.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> it doesn't have a good impression./e-mail me for more: freddy1140@yahoo.com
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> because with seperate ones, they only hear one side of a story and can't really conclude anything.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> nuuu.. u cannot b born gay,, its sumthin one decides on
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> there's no age on love or marriage.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> mostly at their workplace, laundrymat,walmart, or on the internet, im sorry!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> they go to a doctor for help and answers !
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> we have had our up's and down's, but we have made it.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> ya should ask her out that's what i would do if i were a guy

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> He probably didn't want any relationship at all.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> think, will you actually remember it in 30 years?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> tell him you found someone better him , you not come around you again
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> Just because your friends are getting married doesn't mean you should be.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_45> If she doesn't want to, than don't do it.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> Don't throw yourself at men you are not desperate.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> at any chat program there is such rooms
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> WHERE DOES THIS IDEA COME FROM THAT VIRGINITY IS A PROBLEM?

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> ever hear of the expression true love waits?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> what you got to do is set your mind back to the right path.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> GIRL THIS IS 2006 MAKE YOUR MOVE BEFORE ITS TOO LATE AND HE FINDS SOMEONE ELSE.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> when i woke up he greeted me good mornin, d and made me mac and cheese.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> kind of creepy, thirteen is a bit young for anyone, messing with preteen emotions is never good
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> so yiea, go ahead wit yo self and do it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> dont do anything they dont want to do or are not ready for.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> times is precious  hope this helps
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> dont forget her girlfriends too..they are one of the judges...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Don't have sex in the bed all the time.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Do u not think girls get tongue tied?
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> Ok, first shave off your beard.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_20> times is precious  hope this helps
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> Don't have sex in the bed all the time.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> Do u not think girls get tongue tied?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> Ok, first shave off your beard.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> Whatever you do, dont go to a movie.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> how can i make my two bestfriend be friends again ?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> If you love him...give him a chance.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> there was his stop so he got off the train.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> there are movies that i haven't seen yet.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> if you want, email me and we could talk.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Trust me, I was that guy.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> cuz we always have 2 have r way
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> just ignore him if he talks 2 u and let your firend like him
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> don't listen to that chic, nothings happening for her either.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> if you dont trust him then you dont need to be with him.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> have a mutual friend ask him who he likes.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> what cause you dont have any kids?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> call him at work and ask him out.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> ... if you started NAIRing your nutsack, you've gone a little too far.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> i hate it when fellow girls wanna beat eachother up.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> when its your money he's spending then its ok to gripe and groan.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> but being a virgin in no way affects your health or love life.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> I think hygiene is one thing (did I spell that right?)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> I think people look like total idiots dancing.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> If its truly your love bird it will return, if not it was never yours to begin with !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> I want to learn because it helps a guy get laid.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> The only man who doesn't cry is Chuck Norris...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> start a group and stand out
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> don't give them your full trust.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> People lie and cheat more than they ever have.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> What I felt while doing it was why can't this be my wife.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> you haven't found the right person yet
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Maybe a return joke, not in vengance but the spirit of fun
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> theres nothing wrong with it as long as it's legal!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> If you invited her to lunch then you should pay.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Pick yourself up and go out....have fun!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> THEY ARE WOMEN, AND WE ARE MEN!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> U r rihgt it is often hard to buy for men.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> don't arouse her or at least amuse her, then it's a bad idea to force it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> You hav better shot at it working.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> I can say that men see porn as sex.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> i try to get his attention,but it never works
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> depends on the girl and how kinky they r.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> i guess because he would just come up to me and do it without notice.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> Tust Me I know all about it and it worked for me
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> A woman who is 21 and in college,  no.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> I think it could survive, why not?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> Like I said you deserve better than that!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> were you paying with check or cash on the payments?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> you guys just make it look hard.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> would you buy a burning house?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> after all, the mess is between the two of them.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Guys love girls that give h e a d but seldom take them home.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> and everyone like me (the Goths & the Emos) hate you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> ;) That *IS* the stunningly-perfect thing.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> but all in all you have to do what is best for you and him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> You gotta have time for that too.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> guys have a hard time dealing with things that girls do.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_25> it's not realy a sub., i like Gym
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Say im already in lov with some on els
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> all in all, treat her like she is already a good friend, you cant go wrong
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_20> hiee mayb i can help u out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> I think it is a little too late.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> im not in india but i think if you wanna have sex.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> But hey, I've known myself my whole life.'
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> you need to think about it
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> even then becarefull very grey area depending on the judge.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> So what if another woman takes a guy back and then gets dumped again.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> But, he'll still have to pay.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> he then asked me, do you mind if we cuddle, diane?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Old enough to know what true love is, and mature enough to not f'k it up.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> make him want u, dont go around wit that dumb shit omfg!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> I was very shy before College, and that hurt me with the ladies...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> Just for asking that - I hope your girlfriend gives you a good tongue lashing!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> I dunno...  Ive been stuck in the dugout.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> But u should wait til the time comes.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> LIKE A CAR YOU HAVE TO BE WILLING TO FIND THE RIGHT PERSON TO FIX IT.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> what the hell are you talking bout?
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> F U C K your self, the best solution.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> these guy look at older women .
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> If you don't try to crash me...
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_10> YOU DON'T HAVE TO FIND LOVE.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> safe sex that is, like perfectly legal sex, is there?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> If things will make good out the both of you,then sure,head on!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> You cannot sail in two boats at thde same time..........if u still love shaun then stick to him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> (were only 14 but he does have a job fixing help fixing roofs)I feel like hes cheating on me!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Maybe thats why he took them!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> it would be horrible if u didnt try to help her and then she got in a bad situation.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> i just had to accept it.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> no no no no bad approach.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> does this mean she likes me or is it just a friendly offer?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> he'd want to spend time with you (not just in bed)and he'd call.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> we are always chillen and i give him some things to say to her.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> I don't want to go anywhere..
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> Maybe i'm tired, had a bad day at work..whatever, whatever...you know???
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> friends and family and love and relationships.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> If you want to that would be nice.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> communicate no matter how tough it is.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> men who have this appear stronger for me.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> there are more people out there who are like you than you realize.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> Sex wouldn't be much fun would it?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> if your gf is really lesbian i dont see what much can be done.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> Way too young to get married, best not to have sex.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> i used to be one of them, so trust me.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> they won't let you cry and be hurt
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> wen u think he is the one.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> don't let the age stop you...my brother married someone 5 years older than he was ...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> Just get to know her.Try talking to her,and then(if you become friends with her)tell her that you like her.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> don't try to fit in just to be popular because popularity doesn't mean you have alot of good friends.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> That said, I wouldn't make too big a deal of it with him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> remember, just ask a guy that you like if he likes you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Hi Muncher... the name's Jack, I know a little about what you are talking about.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> U CAN ASK HIM OR HAV A FRIEND ASK BUT HE MIGHT SAY NO WHEN HE REALLY DOES 4.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> I can't find it inside to talk to her or look at her with out really wanting to scream...
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> It's all in GOD's timing, not ours!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> ANY IDEAS HOW TO FEEL BETTER?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> On that same note if it is too wrong seek help!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> tone it like an ordinary everyday thing.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> yeah i should listen to a guy who has this question.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> my b'day is on 1aug n my zodiac sign is leo.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> necking is when you are nuzzling their neck.no there isn't
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Nope, it's his if in his name no matter what.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> depends on where you are talking.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Marriage SUCKS, that's why you shouldn't do it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> If he wont stop, or cant stop - you ought to consider Why?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> when ever possible a mouth close to her ear is always hot.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> staying together for the child is not good for anyone.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> i think that they like poetry
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> Why do you ask anyway...enjoy it while you can...its amazing!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> your first impressions about him are very important..does he look like he is a good man?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> WHAT DO U THINK OF THIS?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> Beat the living crap out of her boyfriend.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> But the one thing that I just keep thinking is that Is it worth losing what I have now?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> First tell them to do this....then say you want something else.... and then go on like that.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> If no then something is wrong.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Remember who you married, and not the things that aren not important (like leaving the seat up, etc.)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> !He will not appreciate what ever you get him.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> how much money has he wasted on you, if its more than what you would have guessed then maybe.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> well.. anything is possible... just haven't found 1, do u?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> The obvious is she has something he likes and you don't.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I wouldn't believe a simple comment like that would be flirting at all.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> i think he will say this words to u. just remember this and god bless u sweety.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> but only say it if you really do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Maybe you shouldn't even worry about this just yet.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> quit vascillating and get back on the horse.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> There are people out there that doesn't give a damn about noone else but themselves.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> If you dont tell her that you just want to stay good friends.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> no woman is worth your time if she doesn't want you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> don't mess up your life with him girl!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Men dont like to talk much..
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> or maybe you read his body language???
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> how old are you i would love to chat to you lol please reply
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> pucker up girl or get naked.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> Well, here's the brutal truth: Variety is the spice of life!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Besides, if you have someone else ask him, he's prolly just gonna blow ya off.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Marriage is a load of crap.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> now doesnt because she got cought and put into consiling.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> look at him in and tell it to him straight to his eyes.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_20> i guess so i saw a few already
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> stare at him till he notices ur staring at him, then smile and wink :)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> if you lie again, try to protest the treatment or make excuses then it's over.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> IF WE DIDN'T SCREAM YOU WOULDN'T THINK YOU WERE ANY GOOD!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> here are the possible scenarios i can think of: he is shy?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> i think 21 is apropriate, becuase they are mature.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> oh its at yahoo 200 miles from you.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> but be firm this is your time to be pampered not his.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> It's good to clean things up a little down there.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> I know how hard it is.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> if he dosen't like you thats his problem not yours
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> no,just like u always answer Dr.No
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> WHEN THE RIGHT PERSON COMES ALONG YOU WILL DEFINITELY KNOW IT BECAUSE YOUR HEART WILL TELL YOU SO.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> its hard because your prolly scared to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> if you like yourself and what you are doing, and are excited about it, gurls will like you.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> i think hes scared to love you, so he broke up with you for that reason.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> and if he notices u probley  u may have a  chance
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> Say whatever you have felt about her............truly and sincerely
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> maybe they lost ur e-mail address.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> what kind of girls do you look for??
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> ...for example: celebrity gossip, fashion, rules of relationships (i.e.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> I think not cause women really like the real guy
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> if it isnt too hot at that time of the year, maybe even get married at a baseball field.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> I don't know about other guys...
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> Lets be friends, add me to your messenger :D
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> heres a hint..... its between your legs.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> if it isnt too hot at that time of the year, maybe even get married at a baseball field.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> I don't know about other guys...
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> Lets be friends, add me to your messenger :D
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> I THINK YOU SHOULD TRY EXPLAININ TO YOUR WIFE THE SITUATION.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Happy Valentine Day to you too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> he's just trying to play all hard, trust me because i'm a black female.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> If you love your girl, ask her to marry you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> the first time i tried, i found a knew desire that seemd to take control of my life.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> but hows she gonna feel better about her self if your acting like this.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> i no thats what i do
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> whatever you do, never take sides.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> I wouldn't consider it as flirting alot of guys have liked my long hair but they weren't flirting.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Do not try to make this guy happy.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> that she smells down there and she needs to douche without hurting her feelings.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> I wish guys could just be honest though!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> Some of us are just quiet......
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> a single rose on each plate if theres lots of people attending make it for the main tables only.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> if that keeps up that's the end of civilization.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> give him a little space, don't call him for a while let him miss u and call you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Men are always pulling off crap like that.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> talk to her in a serious way¡¡¡
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> beat the everloving crap out of her.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> U don't know u is in love u feel it not talking about sex .
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> hey.wat if there not true lovin real loyal friends.u might get tat feelin too.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS have a lawyer.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> hey can u answer my Question what are the negative effect of family planning.. in 100 words,,,,,,thanks
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> pop up questions of a vacation or time to spend with eachother
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> if he is broke, than you should worry.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> and give her a dumb look.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> no,not all girls are like this.just don't give importance to that girl whi don't care for your feelings.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i have no clue why your asking!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> if you can then why would you want someone?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Going slower is always better in the long run- or in the BIG picture!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> then what about all the gymnasts?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> Gosh, I just don't get it.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> but so far your education and culture stops your soul from yelling and shouting.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> But shes not coming in any films now..
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> if he does mabey him or what about your mother?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> To some women out there LOVE = MONEY (unfortunately)
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> No drama is going on with u and him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> for instance:  nick denny + NE or nick denny + nebraska  or maybe try nicholas denny
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> if u really love them then it dont matter
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> If he accepts... would you want that?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> something that a normal friend would not
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> But, I have a bf thats wonderful 2 me' and I learned alot.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> When a chick is sucking and the dude is licking all at the same time
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> i am sure u will feel good then!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> noone but you knows what is best for you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> the 2 who fought have long since made up & moved on.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_60> i am naturally thin, not anorexic.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> treat your wife right, respect and love her like day one everyday and your relationship will never sour.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> If you look for love you looking for trouble.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> Sweetie...if you have to ask....then its not love.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_35> Hi Callgal,    ITs all abt trust...heheeeeeeee
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> If not, then they never were.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> for all i know you could be some overwieght pimple faced freak!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> You don't want her to think that's the only thing on your mind.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> She begged me to screw her and I did.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> most men will think you have .
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> AND IF HE DOES HOW DO I APPROACH THIS PERSON THAT I AM BEING TO LIKE MYSELF.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> mabe she thinks the same thing boutz u
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> im 11 u should pick guys out that you like,hang around them,the hot ones try 2 notice,but,might not.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> He even told my mother that he wants to be with me.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> girls are alot more easy to impress than you think.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> Uh, i know that one soooo good.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Anyways...Its cuz they left an imprint-when you fall in love again youll think of your first love automatically
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> I thought i had one.... but someday without recognizing i meet someone and now we're best friends.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> All of them (except the ugly)
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> or is she mellow and doesnt care.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> its kinda sad that we are so worried about looks isnt it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> lol.i dont think there is anything wrong with a litle foot fetish.lol
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> if hed get mad , keep it to urself.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> most rebels seek love... so just try to be affectionate but not possessive.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> because i need to know so if you would leave a message that would be great!!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> choose a person that is there for you always.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> next time try checking for spelling.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> (example: Like going to the theatre - Stage not movie?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> This will surely make things better 4 u.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> i got real diomond earings and he made me dinner
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> no girl wants to go out with a cheap guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> if its not a native in him !
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> well, why i get turned off is cuz they look like they are just doing it to get attention.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> A bouquet of flowers with pictures of yourself all in it
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> it's the number after 68 and the one just before 70
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> well ive got more guy friends then girls
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> im kinda of a smart guy... can i use that
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> A white iPOD Nano would be nice though.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Your too young to be thinking about that, you have your life ahead of you!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> As I said, I feel for you and I *truly* mean that!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> im not really for sure if i should or not.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> any advice ladies or men please help!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> dont ask me if it feels good to a girl, ive never experienced that.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> Is it walks on the beach?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> 'cause if you 'cheated' on him, whats the point in being HIS     friend?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> however, it doesnt sound like he's very happy with her at all.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> you know for me a single parent is very tough but it also depends on you... why?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> O yea .. Wat's ur b/f name ?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> you rub your genitals on the monitor...just make sure you aren't at a cyber cafe...that was embarassing
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> It's the least you can do...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Emotionally you are cheating on her on principle...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Don't be shy and just approach him,if u don't talk u'll never know.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> cause they haven't been crapped on by enough jerks yet.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> jus show them that u have more balls than them.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> if u like valentine's day then u should.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> she is trying to put me in jail so that she can get the kids back ...whats you opinion?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> i'm a guy who just can't get enough outta my love life.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> First of all, don't hate yourself.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> but i am not a cow girl or a contryfied redneck.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> heck I got a new Jaguar.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> wat is wrong with you that's jus a little to old child.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> may be u never tried....try to love him...automatically u will understand him...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> tell them dont pressure u the right time will come.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> ask ur boyfriend because she may not be liein and she may.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> they see me as their trophy that has to be perfect so that they can show me off.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> I have friends that did that and they are so much happier now.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_35> from the back...well...i'll let you figure it out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Who told u , that u are good...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> My favorite dreams are when I fly.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> she likes you to if you talk all the time.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Oh wise fool, ye hath spoken.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> (hey i herd your going out with _____ so thats great)and look for his answer.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> and if he is the love of your life he will come back.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Play pool, drink (tea of course), Skip that long term relationship stuff...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> because then i would do it and keep it to myself.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> you could listen to me if you want to.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> If you can't talk about it then you're not ready.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> y dont u invent a time machine
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> WELL IF YOU CHEATED THEN YOU PROBABLY WONT.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> of course what u look like specificly face boobs and behind
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> She doesn't trust you... You want to know why???
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> they always expect me to be somebody that i'm not.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> when both of you are ready then you'll know how to talk about it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> Women don't ALWAYS get abused...only when they are with an ABUSIVE male that has a head problem.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> or try this- i love you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> the woman it suppose to be a surprise for him or if not you should go together
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> i think alot of guys past up some pretty good woman because of looks.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> plus trust is what hold relationships together!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Or may you just did if he reads these too.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> If she glares at you or turns her head...move on.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> he matchs you with his life (that shows how much he cares about you).
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> If you gotta ask this ?--- then YEP-- she prob' IS
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> yea u should walk her to herlock and talk 2 her and tell her how u feel
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I don't think it should matter.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> your sister should realise about him.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_55> Well blah blah blah, I hope this helps you out.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> at least not in my dreams.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> But if you like it, then go ahead.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> What ever he tells u for the phone being off use that same line right back at him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Love make u do things that u don't normally do.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> First of all AWW how cute getting married on valentines day and Congratz!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Your so young, plus it's the best when your in your 20's
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_25> Kiss Any Age, Sex at 15-18 with protection ,18 + whateva u want
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> its because SOME guys are really big jerks and really big idiots!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Grandma, you used to do such beautiful cakes!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I hate all the guys out there that abuse their girlfriends/wives!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> choose one and hope she dont find out about the other.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> go ask him out, for hell's sake.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> I no this question aint love and romance but i really wanna no.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> So basically all your doing is breaking a heart.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Go to My Q&A and click on the avatar thing.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> And we ARE looking for guys, just not in the same way that guys look for girls.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> just keep talking to people your sure to find people even if you cant date them.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> It sounds like you love your boyfriend a lot.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> Most guys want girls they cant get and they jus dream about.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> For chrissakes, woman, get a grip.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> I was a virgin bride when I got married at the age of 28!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> Well we do ,it's just that most girls aren't that nice in return but I'm not one of them.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> i like this girl that sits in front of me in hisory.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> hell i cant open up to myself ha good look.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> maybe he feels guilty or really just wants one thing and doent want to get personal
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_35> Guys are like that you know.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> my tounge and a womans private regions... especially with my vibrating tounge ring
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> and I don't even know if he even cares about me anymore.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> I personally don't care what the people I date look like (within reason).
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> if he's in a relationship leave him alone find your own guy.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> when she says do ya wanna feel?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I like their eyes, they tell alot about people that they don't want you to know.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> You just haven't found the right man yet, so don;t give up.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> But I can't help the way I feel.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Is that like the two GAY Irish guys that got married ?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> Bring them on anytime... mm mmm mmm!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> I couldn't help it ; I'm HETERO and proud of it !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> also if you can play an instrument, thats instant sex apeal!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> update both of you about what's going on.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> That'll win ya his love alright.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Spend time with family and friends.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_35> that depends.....on who asked for the date.....the person who asked for a date pays
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> Flowers on the side always makes me feel special when I recieve that from my guy though.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_20> You don't hun, cheaters never prosper...doncha know its not cool to be a homewrecker!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> or get him something that he really likes.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> (it might seem like a date, but there are differences.)
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> second of all, you should tell him that you like him!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Well, it's all about what YOU are comfortable with, but if it were ME, I'd feel totally weird!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> i would think it would only strengthen any kind of relationship between you!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> ....Have a gr8 time ......hope u ll send me invitation for marriage..hope so....congratz.......
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> good luck is all that i can say.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> Maybe u shud try hookin up wit a girl instead of a cat.....that ud help out alot!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> WAIT TO SEE WHAT HE DOES.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> like i love my husband, but feel for this new guy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> i only like body buldiers that arn't to musculer and that don't keep their shirt off 24/7.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> that all depends on how he feels about you using his name on the internet.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> because they are shy and immature!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> like wear an apron with nothing else on., etc.)
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> he cant control you if you dont let him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Sweetie, you will eventually grow up and find that not all guys are stupid and freaks.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> im still trying to get over an ex who i havnt seen in almost 4 years.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> let me know what you think.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> Toothpicks can't say the same, lol!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> But still keep calling me and ask me out.Why?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Just make sure your trying and not a coach potato!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> but it mite not happen all the time... remember its all in the mind.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Because it's a man telling his woman that she is EVERYTHING to him!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> And women let them, so why not.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> its mostly cuz they really dont beleive it or they r to scared to say it to their face.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> if she rejects you hey i will always be here.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> We're talking about guys here, of course it's possible!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> printed business cards with wedding date, names etc.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> But i've met some great people who were in wheeelchairs and went on in life and found love!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> If you have to ask, I doubt you know yet...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> first, ask him wat he would do if he found out u cheated.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> Just get them.. not that hard.. Just go up a man you like and ask him out.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> i wouldn't want to lose a friendship, but i thnk he likes me too!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I dont know what your age is, but no matter.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> this is of course just for now, if you get married, who knows what it will be like... :-)
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> If they dumped you then it really wasn't meant to be.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> check your local jr/sr high it is teeming with boys
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> what do i do without kicking her a s s?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Like do they always go for looks?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> and use one or more of them.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> if you dont fit into this profile that their lookin for they dont even give u a chance.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> I don't like it and neither do you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> I say more power to him...lol... but, if he loves himself, will he swallow?
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_30> move on, he has found someone eles... sorry sweetie
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> I guess it all depends on what type of question you are asking.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> The name of the so called female!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> 16 is not too young to think about having sex.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> But it was not so good!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> And once you get out, don't go back.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> BUT WHEN FANTASY BECOMES REALITY; WELL, REALITY CAN BE VERY SCARY.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> i guess they think it is kewl to b the dominate on in teh relation ship.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Yes, but not as quick with a woman with some nice firm cleveage.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You just have to look hard for them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> i think she may be intersted.... good luck!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> read the book he's just not into me.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> mayb she is mad at u ha ha
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> Are we not human too?Why do men love to abuse us?What do they get from that?Somebody PLEASE HELP.....
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> if you cant stand waiting, you should just try to stop liking him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Its all how you use it!
<NbChars_35> <LevSim_15> **tosses hands up in the air**
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> If you are a beutifull girl no and if you are ugly unfortunately yes
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> You will know when you are in love with someone!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Try , but don't overdo it, it might scare him off!..
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> All my friends had kids - IN HIGH SCHOOL - some got married, some got around.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> lol all the girlz at your school!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> Booty call= 2 people meet up JUST for sex.

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> My bet is most pick Angelina?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> No one likes to eat alone.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> if she loves you, she will look at your eyes,
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> im uncut and have no bad smell.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> if you are nat in love dont meek youre self a sleaf.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> I met a really great guy and I'm really happy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Ther are guys that like thick girls.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> if you visit down south again, try to notice what kind of smell it is.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> everything else is just so freaken confusing..............................
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> I'm a girl and I'm still not sure.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> then this girl in my class said that he LOVES her what shoul i do??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> It sounds weird I know but as a girl i do it too.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> But guess what.....you guys made us that way.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> rinse and repeat as needed.. hopefully every day.

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> we have to kids together and and i want to think about there feelings with what ever i do.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> Most rap, and hip hop sucks.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> most guys have strenuous jobs (a lot of ladies too) .
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> hope that you can get some that can see that nice guys are way better!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> He wants yo feed his ego.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> If your over 18 i say look at bars, church, restraunts, and chicks walkin down the street.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> maybe he is not serious about in your relationship he just flirting
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> He's right... u wasting ur time to a nonesense guy.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_15> IF YOU ARE IN A WAR LIKE THAT, GET OUT OF IT!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> just look him in the eyes for a minute.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> and dont listen to people who say this site isnt for dating, because they are just mean.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> But he wont tell me he loves me even after a year and a half!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> yea sweetie - way too young
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> Go out with the girl that likes you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> n ignore him a little bit n the next time he asks you too the movies dn't go!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> because i can't stop paying them to be
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Cuase ummm lets think.......... o ya caus wen they see sombodi prettier theyll like them instead.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> my girlfriend, did the same thing.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> There ARE more girls than guys in the world.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> if he DOESNT act like that toward other girls, then SWEET!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> 2. hey, u free fri (or whatever) night?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> tell your cusin i mean your stuck with him for life and you might drift away from your friends
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> involve in another activities!engage ur mind always!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> I mean, they probably would have no idea what to talk about 9not that they shouldn't!)
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> well first of all, you shouldn't try to break him and his girlfriend up.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> Sometimes women like when it's hard... What?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Just say, Hey, if I were bigger than you, would you still wanna be with me?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> just read ladder theory, really shouldn't have, i have more guy friends than gal friends, and now....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> If he says no, ask another guy.
<NbChars_40> <LevSim_30> He definitely is not COOL n'est-ce pas?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> depends on where the piercings are
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Me and my buddy did it a lot.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> lots of things which they don't have,love,friendship,hmmm and ****
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> if he's got an extra bulge in his pants
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Y do wives have to gain weight and quit having sex once you get married?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Yes you r 2 yug 2 b thinking about marraige with someone.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> we love watching our loved one .
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> by asking this question to thousands of people
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> take a hot shower wit alot of soap
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> but you need to move on.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> Because he is a jerk that is disrespecting you!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> Then from there anything can happen...if things arent so good at home.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> we realized that age doesn't matter if you really feel strongly for that person.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> eyes and smile *yummy* oh and the muscle factor!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> He says he loves you, but thats not enough?
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> Depends on how BIG Big Shawn is.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> Married guys see nothing they want in the bedroom and go to the fridge.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> But your not doing it as a couple.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> Being gay isn't bad, but distortioning the concept IS
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> Some guys are just jerks and they dont appreciate what women do.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> it just seems like i cant find true love anywhere
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Even if you say you forgive, you dont froget.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> i'm 18, my boyfriend is 21 and we're getting married.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> and those guys are usually jerks, by my experience.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_20> bald is sexy,like porn star sexy!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> do everything to reach at a stage where ur money starts earning for u.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> And then do what you know is the best for you .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> go to the doctor and see if maybe your depressed.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Beg him to come back 2.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> and strange fact is that u have doubt if u really bad person.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> So no it is NOT cool..
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> dont worry the tongue dont even hurt I peirced my own but go get ur done professionally
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> There really are better guys out there, but first you have to get yourself back.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> hey i too am searching for a gf could u be the one if u dont mind plz???????
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> if u are ready enough to cary responsibility for family you build with your love one.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> But I know he isn't happy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> your really too young.. you must be focusing on your studies.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> i was wondering if u wanted to come.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> i am 13 too, you should get a boyfriend if you meet a really nice guy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> But I know he isn't happy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> your really too young.. you must be focusing on your studies.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> i was wondering if u wanted to come.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> i have this problem i can't hold back my ejaculation or my orgasim.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> i think u should go for it, have fun.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> gay men in a relationship don't always have to use protection.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Because the other person HAS ALREADY moved on with their life WITHOUT YOU!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> BUT I HAD A TUBLELIGATION ALMOST 10 YRS.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> you can check out my question, under singles, and dating.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> u dont have to look for anybody, everything might came spontanly!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> No means no, weather it is a girl or guy who says it.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> see I like this guy and I would LOVE to go on a date with him...HOw?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> NO ITS NOT TO YOUNG BUT YOU NEED TO BE THINKING IF YOU ARE READY OR NOT.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Princess,  Yours seem to be a popular question, on Yahoo Answers anyways...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> It sounds like he's probably only great when he's getting his own way.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> If you can't trust me, then to hell with you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> The boss paid both bills :)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> i mean doing it from the anus
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> as long as you dont tell the guy you are having sex with.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> i understand what you are saying becuase iam there.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> jocks are big and stupid and pointless.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> There are some nice guys out there.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> they aren't really men if they have to beat up on a woman.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> and why don't guys like me?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> I acted like i didn't care about him anymore but he still call.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Promise him a surprize on valintines night then brake up with him!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> bug him and try kissing him too
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> why cant they just say it to their faces?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> N E wayz your frenz probably r jealous now cuz your still a Virgin.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> They are dumb untill they grow up.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> but only if they keep themselves fit...no beer bellies!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> hey, i went online, maybe you can too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> why cant they just say it to their faces?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> N E wayz your frenz probably r jealous now cuz your still a Virgin.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> They are dumb untill they grow up.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> but only if they keep themselves fit...no beer bellies!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> hey, i went online, maybe you can too.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> NO ONE KNOWS ,BECAUSE YOU DID NOT GIVE US ENOUGH INFO.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> if you're in love, you'll know!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Ask yourself what you really want?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> or just confront him about it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> and if there arent any nice guys around then just stay single
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> sure, you know actually, anything more than a mouthfull is a waste anyway.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> but later the relationship will breakdown because he couldn't please you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> duhhhhhhhhhh they like with therir i's
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> I don't know for sure - it was so long ago.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> To Pink Stealth: Could you please remove that brick from your a'ss
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Do you know what it is?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> If u don't have a million awkward silences then ur pretty good and have a shoot.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Why not skip dating all together....   Go out.. Bowl..
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> just have a talk before v-day so you can skip gifts if you can
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> this means that he did not like u from inside his heart
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> i am not sure that bisexual girls and girl on girl kissing becoming more common but it cool though
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> i usually try to avoid kissing on the first date.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> I asked her how she liked being teased and she said she loved it!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> MAybe she is mad at u for some reason and u just don't know what it is.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> sex after marriage is an old idea...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> one word sums it all up.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> my wife set me up with her.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> there is definently better ways talk to guys...
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> des hit it on the head.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> And don't worry about the guys who don't look past your size.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> Why should i feel pain , do i enjoy pain ?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> that is so sweet he probly got to know you more after a year in a half.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> If you feel like calling, DO IT!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> To see what else is out in the sea!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> its because of the defination of the word soulmate very difficult
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> I think your wrong and your man really really loves you just like you love him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> i had answered ur other ?
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> do you mean who do YOU love?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> why don't u try 2 find out his fetish fantasy
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> lots of different stds cause a nasty oder down there.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> and she definitely said it because she was jealous.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> and we think that is what guys like therefore we now appear even more sexier to guys
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> I have since re-married, and I still have MY life and I am njoying every second of it!!!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> She cut his throat before he could scream....
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> yeah thats why marriages lasted before sex was all that mattered.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I consider myself a pretty good looking woman but I get passed up for girls with obvious beauty!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> my name pancho i'll show you a picture later and my **** is 8 inches
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Just tell her you would not say no, if she asked you to be her boyfriend/lover...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> IF HE IS WILLING TO GO TO ALL YOUR SCHOLL DANCES GO FOR IT.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> But only get married if your fiance or both of you are finaniancially stable!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> getting them to move on is difficult.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> im right here come get me im horny
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> coz ur d only 1 left in dis group..!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> what do u think i should do about it?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> If so, then you should give it a shot.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> Probably nothing that wouldn't get censored by Yahoo!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> if not just wait for a guy that likes u. if ur really ugly, i hope ur patient.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> you want it to be something that you both enjoy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> but nice guys like that are extremely hard to find.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> They were in my mind peace makers, i wanted someone that wouldn't mind fighting.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> men are hard to understand but you can get around that.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> can a couple regain trust after cheating?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> that guy will come to you soon!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> when u get married u might accidentally cheat.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> Heads = you are fun and cool, tails = not...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> Uhh.... Well, there are some hygiene issues there.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> can a couple regain trust after cheating?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> that guy will come to you soon!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> when u get married u might accidentally cheat.
<NbChars_300> <LevSim_30> Heads = you are fun and cool, tails = not...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> Uhh.... Well, there are some hygiene issues there.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> I cna really explain why guys do this except maybe they are afraid to get close.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> never oppose or disagree with him ever ..
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> yea expecialy when you dared her to.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> I am friends w/ a lot of my ex's.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> how can u consider marriage before meeting the gal?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> FOR ME A RAP SONG BOUT ME!!!!!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> (Wasn't this on Seinfeld, pitchers and catchers?)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> platinum - it looks great and is tougher than gold.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> i think it would depend on the partners ability...
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> If you have to ask yourself if he is cheating he probably is.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_40> chocolates, shopping, ur best friend, become a lesbian..mayb.. get another boyfriend..
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> Guys like to talk about sex.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> He's hanging out with you, right?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> At least I don't do it in front of my man.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> am a girl & take my advice...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Sorry I put you right back where you where but is no lie
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I really need help guys and girls
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Well sweetie if you really are in love with him then forget about it and trust him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> It may take a good while, dude...best of luck nonetheless!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Just ask her, hey i was wondering, u wanna go see a movie friday  (or whichever) night?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_95> The worst thing you could do is to get hung up on any one guy.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> do u c him at school?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> 1) First thing, be honest .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Don't try to control them they will cheat to get back at you
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> PLEASE HELP ME SO WE A HAVE A CHILD!

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> What Katie said is SO true- (Great thoughts girl!)
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> well being gay your chances of finding someone do go  down somewhat.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> -K This is Turkish H.  Yes, walking her to her lock would be SO romantic.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> If he likes you he will be gratefull and unless you hate kids, that shouldn't be a problem.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> MOVE ON, BUT KEEP AN OPEN MIND-IF SHE DID PANIC; SHE MAY STILL COME AROUND.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> you just have to like pay for someone [or use the internet.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> if you really love the one that is furthest away from u then you wouldn`t do anything with anyone.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> Go on a first date again!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> depends on if its the first date or not
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if you don't who will (rock on with peace and love.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> I don't think Jesus would marry a muslim man, do you?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Tried X once- loved the closeness I felt during sex.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> the woman...actually we get a better deal on that because most men like just plain bands!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> honestly, this question makes you sound like a totally shallow jerk.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> i'll give it to you baby!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> I don't look my age and i am a good guy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> kinda like the prince charming thing mostly strong and handsome.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> wow, pretty much everybody gave you a I'm a jerk kinda answer..
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> that, most of the time, means he LIKES u, ok?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> In short.....Repect your self....What go around...Comes around......
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> you can get a divorce for any reason what so ever .
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> so honestly more than a mouthfull is a total waste
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> Say  Hey freek I don't want yor company!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> this isn't really happening to me I just want to know what you guys would do!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> we sat down and he sat right next to us.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> And if you get married do not have baby right away.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> Then tell a lot of fat jokes.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> a few diseases and/or a really bad aftertaste
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_25> u know i can't tell u that even if i tryed.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> SAN ANTONIO, MANY THINGS TO DO THERE, BUT NOT EXPENSIVE.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> hire a private investigator...they are not cheap so be prepared!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> Get out of the house and hang with friends.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> me, im in depresion, dont know abot you.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_50> Think about what your family would say if they knew!
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> How about trusting your heart and head?
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_40> and i think that u r cute u should im me 1 day or email me
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> SO DOES HE LIKE ME OR I JUST IN THE WAY OF WHATEVER HE'S LOOKING AT.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> good question....any details to go with that?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> PLEASE HELP ME IF U CAN!!!!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> I think mature guys do like quiet girls more so than loud obnoxious ones
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> make it sound nicer, like plump, for example.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> I am an Asian and i have a really fair skin but I do like dark guys
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> Ask her if she is interested !
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Stupid question ...man wants opposite sex ...and for ???
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> trying to take control, threatining, hitting, bad history...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> I have a good guy in my life that adores me.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> sry again and thanks for coming to my topic
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> guys think the a woman ont defend herself b/c they would b scared of him.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> fat people are the best ones...
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> slim, girl run for the hills!!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> Just wait until some guy ask you out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Nah--you should just leave it alone.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> do it while she is sleeping or go to another room
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> PROVE TO HER THAT YOU LOVE HER AND THAT YOU WANT TO BE WITH HER FOR A LONG TIME.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Yeah, I don't think that's the kind of question that should be asked here.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> 160,000 rs ( $ 3500.00) ... but thats back in india
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Even told her I would marry her to show her how much I love her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Its hard but you need to get over it!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Then you can mold them into a decent man!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> Every day I have to repeat the sequence.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> yikes...i'd take your time, especially if he;s only 18!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Or What would you get your DAD for his birthday?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> if you did something bad that he wont like, maybe... but if not, why worry?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> I hate you and I think that maybe you should just end your .............. life!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> tell her that her boyfriend is your friend.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> Ever watch the movie American Pie when one of guys actually did a pie?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> No, I think that's kinda mean.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> friends are friends til the end!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> Maybe you're not doing it right.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_10> GET HIM OUT OF YOUR LIFE NOW!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_15> SO I JUST THINK WHAT EVER FLOATS YOUR BOAT!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> friends are friends til the end!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Maybe you're not doing it right.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> GET HIM OUT OF YOUR LIFE NOW!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> i think that men are because they cant hurt you like a female friend can.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> SO I JUST THINK WHAT EVER FLOATS YOUR BOAT!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> And nice guys are sincere and not fun n entertainer as those jerks are.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Just depends on what you like.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> try bein friends wit her again
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> ( duhh) now i just wanna make sure if it's ok
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> depends on if you want him to break up with you or not.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> im very confussed and i would really like it if sum1 can give me sum gud advice...........                                         Thanxx                                             Trish
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_40> a g string and sumthn sexy!)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Ones that have me as a damsel in distress!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> geeks are nice, and overly self aware.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> relocation will not be a problem for little times.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> and saying thats it will not do it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> what would you and your girlfriends say or talk about if that or something like that happened?
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_10> AND IF YOU ARE READY USE PROTECTION!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> if u were my daughter he'd be in jail or get his *ss kick 4 touching my little girl.
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_25> ONLY if he is fine if he ain't u can do better
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> those are some ideas, hopefully they help!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> You are, so far, good job!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> i can tell she kinda like s me.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> I asked why and he said I don't know.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> i think that you are a little confused, you have it backwards
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_25> If ur pimpin..... she's probably cheatin
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> but when men like to do is please his woman.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> Especially if you truely love her and care about her!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> if a 14yo cant outrun a cabbie, you got problems.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> well most guys are interested in hott looking girls.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> but dont do that ok, cuz thats a total stalker right there.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> My dad died when I was 7 and I'm 34 now and it still hurts.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Take it easy, only time will tell.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> b/c when it some down to it women do have the upper hand on things.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> most guys like myself dont like to let our gaurds down for fear of bein looked at as week
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> love not sex is the making of a good marriage!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> So its upto you if you want him to.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Take it easy, only time will tell.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> most guys like myself dont like to let our gaurds down for fear of bein looked at as week
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> love not sex is the making of a good marriage!
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_35> So its upto you if you want him to.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> And I finally got over it!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> so if you want a beautiful life, then give it to God.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> I'm not going to lie men are great fun, but not worth losing a true friend over.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> Tell me, why u think that ur girl is cheating on you?
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_25> ni*ga u acten lyk a lil b*tch rite now quit n jus bang him
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> but it was gentle like it was apropreate for that night.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_50> many.but you are looking in the wrong place
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_10> UH OH  I CANT COUNT RIGHT NOW
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> If you have even the slightest doubt then don't do it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Just squeeze you butt cheeks its about the same.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> we love eachother so much and we can't live without eachother.what should i do!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> well, don't think having a different gender person as a friend is embarrassing, it's not!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> The best outcome  being that he'd like you for both :)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> take them, who knows, maybe u'll meet somebody
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> we are always hanging on each other and and he always says he loves me.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> No, you shouldn't have sex until your are married!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> if u r getting married...y r u worried?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> so yes, i would rather love and loose than never love at all.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> :-) You can use that if you like.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> If you know your guy then you should be able to tell if he's lieing or not.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> No, you shouldn't have sex until your are married!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> if u r getting married...y r u worried?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> :-) You can use that if you like.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> If you know your guy then you should be able to tell if he's lieing or not.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> Like if you were closing your eyes would you know the difference?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> yes and it is horrible to have everyone stare at u then comes the worst part the gilt
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> My bf hates girls kissing on each other.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Suck it up I say to her...use the support for what it is intended.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> i want to give him something creative
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> but im not sure you could go to jail because its a pretty high amount
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> but if u do decide to, dont have anymore kids than that, unless its because u got married
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> i like both wich 1 do u like???????
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Don't do a half-a$$ job at something.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> heres an idea...tell your boyfriend to tell her (infront of you) that hes not interested in her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> go to a bar or a famous rich theatre
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> Well.... My legs are nice & long, but my ass is pretty wide, so.....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Hes a jerk you dont just leave a person hanging like that.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> whenever i make a mistake they really dont harshly punish me.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> or a male friend of the family?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> if yo have any good edvice plaese let me know.thanks
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_35> Is he who he says he is?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> boys are not that haed to find but make sure you dont find the wrong type.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_15> WHEN YOU ASKED,AND IF IT WERE HIM, YES.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> unles it's a guy they are discussing.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> And yeha' I loved him and couldnt see myself with any one ealse.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> most any guy will jump at being with you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> boys are not that haed to find but make sure you dont find the wrong type.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> WHEN YOU ASKED,AND IF IT WERE HIM, YES.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> unles it's a guy they are discussing.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> And yeha' I loved him and couldnt see myself with any one ealse.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> most any guy will jump at being with you.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> you are pathetic to break up with a guy because he dosen't look good.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> First BE a FRIEND to HER/HIM.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Or just a relationship for the fun of it?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> I just want to see what happens when you find out THE HARD WAY!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Chances are, if he's the type never to call you, he's not waorth it anyway.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> Hell' yeaha' you get help of u tell him to go fu** hiself, beacuse your better than that.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> go to avatar.yahoo.com if you have'nt made a avatar yet.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_10> FIRST BECOME ARACNIA AND THEN JOIN LINKEDIN OR DOOSTANG...
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> Bill-Youre not supposed to tell any1 about that!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> And I wouldn't change a thing!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i have complete confidence in you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> ?..dnt try to portray urself as someone else n just be urself..AND YES NO LIES AT ALL!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> No....I got married on Valentines day, and it was a disaster.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> find a new one, his best friend.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> if he is a sincere then he is mostlikely not leading you on.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> so they tend to try to live them thru there children.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> you could try talking to a friend or family member and that may help
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> more than likely the guy your with is just dealing with sensation overload.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> if i had to guess, i would say it menat you danced so much it wore through the rug
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> ASK GOD TO BLESS YOU WITH ONE.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_35> That's just a rule of thumb...If you have to ask...then its not love.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> If you think she'd be angry then don't do it.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> Trust me, if he told u that he loved u, u wouldnt like him as much.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> small candels... wrap them yourself with little bags and tie pretty ribbon around them..
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> How much do you love your bf?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> I don't k now what he is expecting...and HOW.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> If you start doing something and it doesnt feel right..stop.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> that's the way to do it... turn it up another notch!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> sometimes it is  blessing in disguise
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> but hey, I guess if you want to, and you treat each other right, why not?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But don't get worried he just might want fellas night out with no ladies interruption.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Just ask him if he with any1 esle and what does feel for you?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> i do not think its rape if their both willing?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> take him to court if he does not respond.....
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> If they like it stay with them.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> OK I got married a few months before I turned 21 and then I got pregnant right after.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> Can't be that much if you cheated.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> I think you only love YOURSELF
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> just because....strangers in the night, aids in the morning ;)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> Then tell him you guys can just be friends.
<NbChars_40> <LevSim_25> otherwise, he's a really great guy, so if you're going to suggest dumping him, don't bother...it's not gonna happen!
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> Sounds like you are .....your owe worst yackety yak!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Then tell him you guys can just be friends.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> otherwise, he's a really great guy, so if you're going to suggest dumping him, don't bother...it's not gonna happen!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Maybe tell him sorry, you are a really great guy but I do not see you that way.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_25> it takes a lot of time.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_20> girls just love waiting...guys love collecting
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> probably wondering if there is love and kindness out there for you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Smile and feel amazing that someone finds you so special.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> Weird guys have a way of attaching and hanging on and stalking....etc.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> HOW DO U GET A GUY THAT U LIKE 2 ASK U OUT WITHOUT HAVING 2 ASK HIM OUT!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> YOU HAVE TO STOP IT IN THE BEGINNING!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> ...WAIT it's the best thing to do.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> BE RESPONSIBLE..RELAX...AND LET HIM PROVE TO YOU THAT HE IS THE REAL THING FOREVER...GL
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> Why not just go for a kiss and see what happens!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> If he's worth keeping, the next time she flirts with him he'll tell her that he's not interested.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Don't worry he is out there,not to far from you now.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_60> I married a man 3yrs younger.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> i do have some redneck tendencies but i am a thugish freak .
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> Probably, you have never made ANY mistake in your life!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> But I am begining to see another side, the one where he is married.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> It sounds like she needs to set some boundaries with her husband...and FAST!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Don't go out with someone like that.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> unless you are fat and hideous or he is.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> does she want a big chunk of ice?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> You want to go to Lubbock!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> U MEN MAKE US THAT WAY LOL
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> bluntley ask them keep your pride in that
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> You shouldn't look for a guy.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> old enough to bleed, old enough to breed
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> have them drop you off about five blocks away.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> greet him with a hug and a kiss .
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> but you, well, its ok for people to date younger dudes.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> maybe before he found you he used to flirt with every girl he saw.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> but u have 2 ask him !
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> AND JOCKS ARE WAY HOTTER ANYWAY!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> if the date was going well then yes
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> If he doesn't like you, thats ok.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> the right one will come along!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> since im a guy... yes kiss the girls make out with them... its normal....
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> then once uve thought about it make ur decision
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> SURE I WILL PICK ME LOL
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> love is not something you go looking for it is something that just happens.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> or something really special we can do.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> don't talk to him till he talks to u
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> from very far away, unless you want to get smacked...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> simple and sweet is how i like it, but most all my friends are into big rocks.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> let him rest for at least 30 minutes.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> here are 4 things to do while not in bed .
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> she's white and sort of a party girl.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_10> EXCUSE US BOSTON GIRLS ARE FINE!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> go to a friend to help you out
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> yeah really, ask him hey, do you want to go out?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> posture , self respect , great smile , height and stuff
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> last you need to ask yourself will looks become a problem
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> my priority used to be friends, family,...but rt now i had to change my prority to only money.....
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> It depends on the woman and you really need to see what yours wants.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> ummm...when you walk together, walk close to her.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_20> Nope, not by a long shot.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> he or she is using abusive language.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> I guess just try to say it as nice as you can.. Good Luck!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_10> IT WILL MAINLY HAPPEN WHEN I GET MARRIED TOO I AGREES ..... MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> SO HOW CAN I GET HIM 2????
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> yes, personally i like them small.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> You'll be happy when they are around, always!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> No, it could spice things up a bit.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> should mean that he likes you.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> I am really sweet and i don't look that bad...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> If you know her colors, then that would be a great option...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> i take a shower everyday (almost)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> I won't b thinking about that for another 2 yrs, unless u have permission from ur parrents.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> How would you like it if someone did that to you?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> But also be sure he CAN trust you!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> But the answer is - because boys are dumb.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Obviously you shouldn't tell him the real reason - but I think you aren't giving him a fair chance.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I just do not get it.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> hair in a bun and eye liner and mascar does work great.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Duh... Its possible for a guy to get horney if he's doing __________?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Be careful so you guys dont ruin the frienship youve got.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> What I mean to tell you is that I'm not good for you.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> internet bf's are simple and you  can express urself more.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> fulfill his fantacy..i am sure u will enjoy it too( even if you said /thot u wont)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> maybe, they for some reason dont want him going out with you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> the same goes with my cat...uh...sir feline.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> I myself would just tell her.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> o.k.- did that answer your question?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> Don't have one for your info.!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> then if there isnt, say fu.. you bi..., i thought we were friends!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Valentine's Day is just for stuff like this.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_5> EVERYONE ELSE IS GOOD TO GO.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> you really don't know what that is?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> I small breeze blowing the right way can make a guy aroused!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> jewlrey, but definetly a teddy bear...
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_40> but wait so you don't get hurt.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> TRY TO EXPLAIN HOE YOU FEEL
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> no but reassuring him won't cost you anything if it gives him peace of mind.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> Guys are pretty simple to please.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> well just tell him u like him if u have luck  u will recieve it!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> most people dont want a fat woman or man unles they are a fat man.

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> looking to get to know females.

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> you could allways try a pen friend if you dont wanna go thru old channles.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> Its when you steal tears & still care for Her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> If she can't stand not seeing you, then it would probably work
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> And theyd know it'd be a harder relationship than one with a guy who's NOT in wheelchair!
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_25> no it is the same it is all about you

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> yeah 2 very different things, in love, romance is always present but in romance, love is not always applicable
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> First off see if your boyfriend would be up for a 3-some.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> thats very interesting...... the better you feel about the person- the better the sex feels.

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> i had a friend for 25 years and last year i had sex with his wife.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> U can surely get the number but when  u call, apologize for intruding in her privacy...!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> the number between 68 and 70. just kidding
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> If you feel bad about this then I dont think you are a bad person :)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Men are a dime a dozen!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> be yourself and ask a lot of questions....pay attention...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> use rubber and prepared to get your anal analized.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> nanny cam, or the show cheaters or private detectives.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> Not sure, but i'm glad you're not a hoe,whore or a slut...  Where are you from?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> let him like making love to u then he will always be good to u, men like sex.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> And...listen to what your heart is telling you.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> Hey I'm 19 going on 20 and I'm getting married this summer also.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> its hard to let go, but sometimes guys just act like a child.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> If she penetrated you, then you're just kinky.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> yea right thats a lont time.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> walkin up to a girl in person is much more real.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> its OK to think about them, its called memories.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> If she penetrated you, then you're just kinky.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> R U the shy kind of girl?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> yea right thats a lont time.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> walkin up to a girl in person is much more real.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> its OK to think about them, its called memories.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> well first thing is probably not to try too hard.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> teddy gary, i dont apreciate that.that leads to addiction, depression, an even suicide.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> we are not nuts...there are times that we can seem it but most of us are perfectly sane
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> wanted know is he the right one!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> I am a little shy but i do open up after a while.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_25> Lots of good food, free booze.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> Most of them are losers now.

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> have you ever told him that you love him?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> Keep in mind though, that 77  is always better than 69.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> yes it happens all the time
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> But you better figure it out soon!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Well, I personally wont date younger guys.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> Sence it's so little, they get tire of waiting.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> no offense but tell them about.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> .don't know but I am going for the points!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> if they say that they're parents made them than they probally not lying about it....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> secondly, you friend DEFINITELY doesn't hate U.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> you shouldnt ever choose boys over a friend.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> the girls in my school wont accept me as equal because im a virgin.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> hey, you shouldn't be so hard on yourself.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> the kind where you learn to dance for your man , maybe even using a strip pole.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> why would he break up with you on valentines day?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> you shouldnt ever choose boys over a friend.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> the girls in my school wont accept me as equal because im a virgin.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> hey, you shouldn't be so hard on yourself.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> the kind where you learn to dance for your man , maybe even using a strip pole.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> why would he break up with you on valentines day?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> Then, if he still looks clueless, kiss him.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> some of us learn to appreciate a really nice guy!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> um...mcdonalds and then a walk i guess.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> but me, I dont really see a point in what I just wrote :P  I'm just a kid :)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> i think vixxenkitty hit it right on the mark with doing the math.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> can i change his thinkings style  habits
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> I ACTUALLY THOUGHT OF SOMEONE IN FLA.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Life is so beautiful; just look around you.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> DUDE LOOKS AT ME AT LEAST ONCE A DAY.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> Looks fade........but kind actions and words last forever!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> So yeah I guess it is possible.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> well I am the cutest !
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> if hed wanna talk it out tell him.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_50> get over him and you deserve better.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> but 4 realb what if you did that sh** then what.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> i think its just cuz it makes them feel good about themselves.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> im sure someone would be willing 2
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> Don't tell her,but don't go after her boyfriend either.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> or sex is the main ingredient?
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_35> However, people can change....but, like I said, I believe the chances are slim...  Good luck!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> my friend i know its hard 4 u!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Look for condoms...wrappers, boxes, coupons, etc.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Why did you once turn her down?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> think about what you will tell your kids  son did i ever tell you how i met your mother?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> And if you're not the one dying, then get busy livin'!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> and by then you wont have to worry about that becase he loves you any way.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> no there will be no problem if ur love is true.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> I have one and thingings are going great we have trust and we talk every chance I get.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> she might not brush her teeth
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> what about- you're a real friend!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> I hope you know what you are doing... cause it could get real ugly real fast.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> when a woman loves a man she'll do everything in her power to make that man happy!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> some guys are just flirty and friendly, though, and act like that toward all or most girls.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Everyone knows only guys do that kind of thing, right?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> some there whole body shakes some there toes tighten up or goose bumps.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> Go to them and say hey!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> When youre really finished with this guy youll be REALLY finished.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> what if he had followed us home or something?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> the same thing happened to me i dumped him cause he cheated on me!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> i had to reassure him that no matter what i wouldn't return to my ex.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> a lot of girls are experiencing because it is sexy!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> you should just say i can't do my homeboy like that but i had a good time with you
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> No, don't throw it all away just becuae your freinds think your wierd.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> Until he calls....  actually- dont wait at all.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Not to mention your strong right hand ;)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> because men hired investigators if they suspect .
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> (my kids are 14 months apart!)
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> Immeidietly when she got to iran, everyone there despised her untill she covered up!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> it's gonna come back to haunt you one day.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> why he is trying to punish your sister for your father?.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> she can give you away too you know.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Women love to be flirted with.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> it hasn't came out yet but you should start looking
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> Don't just sit around and think of him it'll just make it tougher.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I couldn't ask for nothing more.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> looks like you got the answer to your question.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Is your gut telling you HE IS A BIG CHEATER!!!!??
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> Obviously he is not ... move on and find the REAL love of your life.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> 2) When he comes home .
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> Uh, guys have 6-packs with the washboard abs thing.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> If it really is LOVE and not LUST then you will feel it deep within you!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> what kind of stupid question is that
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> the person closest 2 u that u believe is special enough 2 do it for your father.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> She doesn't want it to get into the wrong hands.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Why didn't you think about this before getting married.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> YOu know, a lock... what could you do without a lock.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> i really really agree with mona!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> but they can also keep their original name :)
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> i mean, they dont see me as their daughter.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Ask her eat much garlic, bet she won't smell like catfood.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Please take what I said and use it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> DEEP DOWN THEY REALIZE THINGS WE DONT ALWAYS LOOK AT.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> HE TOLD YOUR MOTHER HE WANTS TO BE WITH YOU???
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> no if u get 2 atracted(not sayin u will!)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Its not just girls that feel that way about guys.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> trust me, looks change, go for personality
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> be yourself and joke, smile, laugh.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> maybe that's why he hasn't said it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> Fight for it if you want it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> you shouldn't put yourself in situations like that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Yet still go home to her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Just hang out in the mall, and just talk to someone.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> 3. hey, a bunch of us are going out to see a movie/dinner/etc.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> It won't work for some though.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> Then a lil later bring some convo.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> AGO .HOW DO I GO ABOUT GETTING THAT REVERSED SO WE CAN HAVE A CHILD?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> honestle to me it depends on which angle i see her at?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> I want her to understand & realize that I want to help and love her.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> dont no woman want an aggressive man let her warm up to you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> Yea, I really hate when guys say they habe a gf but they don't!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> r u like sexist or something, cuz i don't think guys are stupid or freaks!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> just want to know if there's a way to get him to ease up a bit!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> place on table with a hersey kiss ontop.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> talk it over with your mom or another close family member
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Don't you know that on a first date you need to impress the girl not scare her off.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> and always plan a lot of things when you will finally see each other.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> when you lick a girls pussy while they suck your penis
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> soap AND water at the SAME time!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Someone wrote no one likes to eat alone... Having sex alone is even worse...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> BUT IF YOU LIKE HIM THAN YOU LIKE HIM!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> Make it seem like a casual fun date.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> the one where the hot guy kisses me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> or is it a sign of desperation on my part?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> would love to compete and to hang out with cute guys !
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> My favorite dreams are the one that I realize are dreams and I take control of it.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> r u involve with such a person?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> you have jus got 2 know what 2 do with wotever size u may have.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> Girls have to think LONG TERM.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> But you have to take your time, you are young and you have too much time.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> angelina joilie her lips are incredible
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> I have a friend who always thought that the guy should be the one to call.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> now the difference is it is coming out in public, reviously it was just in a ver closed circle.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> I am looking for hot girl picture real one not from any website any girl there ??
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> There is no way of going back.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> I hope the world caves in you, if you keep it up...you'll deserve it!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> But I really like him.. Should I ask?
<NbChars_265> <LevSim_20> If that doesn't work, move on.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> how about having him over for dinner ?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> He just doesnt know what the heck he wants in his life.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> I'm a female and I won't even let a guy walk behind me.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> You'll find out she's not as great as she seems.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> if you love him then you should feel devastated, but i guess not because youre asking this..
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Maybe it's that don't care attitude or maybe they just stand out.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> and if he wants it, he'll meet you halfway.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> Make it casual like asking him for the time or commenting on how nice his shirt looks.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> 3rd choice - your best male friend.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> maybe your not his girl yet or something!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> why u dont have it to measure .thats why u r asking others.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> now a days it doesnt really matter.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> no matter how hot you physically look .
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> I know thats not the answer you'd expect from a guy but hey life is confusing
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> I really don't believe in generalization.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> most of them doesn't have photos at all.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> On one hand your boys want to hang out, play bocce, and watch the Braves.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> I don't think so, unless you are a guy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> What ever you do, don't fall for that whole if I put out then he will like me line.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Maybe you should try asking what to do so that he wont break up with you!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> like a cd of his fav band.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Is it really my fault that i get urges and there are guys all around me?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_15> COME ON GIRL YOUR NOT A LOSER.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> you probably shouldn't ask her to eat with you at lunch.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> no sense of fighting over a guy unless you love him deeply.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_35> I know how hard it is!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> AND I DANCED WITH HIM ONCE (KINDA) AT A PARTY.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> I'm not a fat single momma either!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> Apparently girls like guys with skills...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> usually after your dr. says so... after your six week visit
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> I can't speak for all women, but I myself think alot like the ladies in the movie!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> maybe wait until  you are both in your twenties, so maybe when he's 22 or so?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I hereby present you with my  DUMB QUESTION OF THE DAY AWARD
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> he probably watched to much porn.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> then you will see how lame he really is!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> i dont no what to do i am so torn   please help
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> i dont, i think that is too kinky for me
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> and yes importent thing is ur career which should be given a priority.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> you dont have to just go out with me.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> when he stops, run like hell and then hide.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> just do what your heart tells you to do.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> i think it would be lonely, especially when you want to cuddle.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> My ex was so stupid, he answered without thinking!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> If he isn't good enough for her, don't kid yourself, he isn't good enough for you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> spend a day or weekend taking care of just her.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> best advice—tell him you're taking a break.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> it also depends on how long they are in there.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> but ... you will have to find the best way to get an Invite from Him !!!!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> so dut so horible, not to accept in my opinion!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> he dosent like you and doesnt wana hurt ur feelings
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> ofcourse guys get horny when they see us ;)
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> don't try to be one of them you have xxx when you are ready
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Give your head a shake, girl!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> but then, keep the mace handy.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> i cant say its too young  but you dont want to just give yourself out.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_45> Brother, uncle, grandfather, good male friend...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> But trust me it probably won't happen that often.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> she'll move away a bit when you're too close for too long.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_25> we are talking ideal here... ok?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> no matter what you decide to do, good luck p.s.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> !in which is not a good time to ask me any important Q's cause i cant talk!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> Get help before you screw this all the way up.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> any way try not remember it!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> any where from 9 to 75,
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> doesn't matter as long as they dig me then i'm down
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> i just think that maybe a country boy for me might be easier.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> you're either pregnant or your not pregnant.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> Well..It sounds like the same thing Im going thru.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> See what I did there, I made a joke.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> i really dont think theres any thing wong with liking girls feet but you just plain freekin weird
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> I dunno...i think it's probably because they're...scared or feel awkward around guys in wheelchairs.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> i haven't but i'm not anti-sex
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> I'll tell you what...your wife married you because she loved you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> well my guy did.. =/  third of all, you should try waiting things out.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> If you like him then you shouldn't try to convince yourself that you don't.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> ull find the right one just dont try to force it!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Some women say it helped them alot.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_25> put my words to the test.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> his friends might just be messin with you.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> i dont know theres something so fake and lame about it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> it that a pic of your girlfriend?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> You do have friends., you just don't know it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> cruel to the guy you were in bed with.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> IT'S REALLY GREAT TO TALK ABOUT COMMITMENT ON THE NET-IT'S LIKE VIRTUAL DATING.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> IF U RFREE TYPE N OPEN WITH UR IDEAS ALL KIND OF WOMEN WOULD LIKE TO TALK TO U
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> I also know a lot of guys who  cheated.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> im in the same position get creative whacking off
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Just because you filed doesn't mean you don't care.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> if they are going to be in there for a few years then i would say no.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> THE PLESSURE FEELS GOOD BUT ITS WORTH THE WAIT.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Hey John, don't worry about getting us a wedding gift.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> well im pretty country and i suppose  like country boys but sometimes i fall for them thugs
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> I always show him that i am strong but its hurt so bad inside.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> youre in bed with this guy, and youre on a totally different subject.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> typical guy answer: you stop being so insecure about yourself, that's how.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> Also maybe he has a problem with just that one friend and maybe he really doesnt like her.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> If your really interested, why wait?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> well he doesent talk to me as much any more and i dont know any more help me
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> But hey, at least if their not then you can rid of them ;).
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> How much did her hurt you?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> i love to torture guyz lolz
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> Even if the sex is concentual (i think i spelled that right) then its still rape.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_20> If you go on places  that have like NORMAL PEOPLES...OF COURSE YES
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> But hey, at least if their not then you can rid of them ;).
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> How much did her hurt you?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> i love to torture guyz lolz
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> Even if the sex is concentual (i think i spelled that right) then its still rape.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> If you go on places  that have like NORMAL PEOPLES...OF COURSE YES
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Ughh, it's so annoying and stressing.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> You should really think about what your doing!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> A lot of guys like quiet girls-- more so as they get older.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> with the love of my life!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> so i would pick the geeks, hell, i have always picked the geeks.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> And you say you always get it?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> ($10)  one time we just went for a walk along the beach (FREE)
<NbChars_255> <LevSim_25> If it is only liking DON'T!!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> enjoy your youth, you don't need to rush life.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> Will he think I did not care at all?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> i think the city is ok .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Maybe you should just keep being friends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> just be yourself and dont try to be somebody.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Hope next time you'll find your Mr Right...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> How old are you by the way?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> you could learn how to spell impress
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> if you really want true answers.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> Even after that, don't bring it up yourself.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> any ideas why hes so distant like that?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> at least he does not want you for one thing.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> Fate didn't drop this guy in your life.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> Say, Listen, I do not mean any disrespect, but you kind of smell.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> But no thanks 2 many sharks!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> walking with her down the hall to her locker is a good idea.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> use different oils, hot wax, maybe some icy hot( not in sensitive areas!)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> if you really like her just go for it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> Many brides will say I don't want a big wedding.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> They tend to not want to be with one girl for too long.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> it matters how he is in general.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_10> ONLY IF YOU REALLY LOVE HIM......PLUS WHAT THEY DONT SEE WONT HURT THEM...........THATS ONLY IF IT GETS THAT BAD
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> that why in malaysia we not recommend married under recommended age.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> those girls should f**k off, they are a bunch of sluts with nothing else to do.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> my guy friend who really likes me is goin to be at my place in less than 20 minuets
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Please dont let a bunch of girls influence you just so that you are accepted: Good Luck: Blueladybug
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_30> so you are like a girl on the side?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> cook and clean - but there is more to it than that .
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_55> was it with the right person?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> I'm glad you asked that question, i have the same problem
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> i hope we don't get hurt, and caught.well good luck and be careful just like i have too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> this depends on your relationship previous to now (old friends, new friends, classmates, etc.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> I think its realy important for a guy to ask this.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> then u'll see if she's really a nice person or just hot.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Hey tracy i don't think you're too young.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> Sorry babe, but guys are mean
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Meanwhile, he goes back to his Wife - who shares his house, money, etc.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> And i can't see myself with anybody else.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> no, love does not have eyes.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> apparently theyre not THAT stupid, it just seems that way because our intelligence surpasses theirs so much...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> like sisters....if i burned 400 calories in 10 minutes, i'd fall asleep too.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> The World is Round & the Net is  HOT!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i also don't have any girlfriend.i think we can be friends.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> it should b when ever u feel like it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> ppl who meet but jus 2 do tha grownup..strickly..but sometimes it leads to serious mess.so be careful
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> But dont do it just because the sex is good.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> yucky diseases that EAT YOUR ASS OUT!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> Why would you even think he is going to?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_20> so, you can't be just kinda smart.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> give her something really nice for her birthday/special day.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> i would said somethin to someone
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> Men need time alone or hanging out with their buddies.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Why would you even think he is going to?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> so, you can't be just kinda smart.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> give her something really nice for her birthday/special day.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> i would said somethin to someone
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Men need time alone or hanging out with their buddies.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Boys come & go but friends are forever....(or should be!)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> which came first the egg or the hen?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> are you that much of a glutton for punishment?

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Should i give him a chance?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Good luck girl, 'cause this stuff is tough to deal with.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Some men learn differently later in life, but many do not.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> if you were his girlfriend and a girl tried to break you guys up, would you want that happening?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> PUT A BAG OVER YOUR FACE
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> but if it were the stuff in dreams, he wouldn't cheat!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> what would we have done then?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I bet you say that to all the boys.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> good question, never thought of that...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> It doenst mean that he doesnt love you, they just need their space like we do.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> yo boo, its hell of fish in the sea.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> dont!that would crush her im sure u can find another reason.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_10> THEY WOULD PROBABLY TALLK  ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE MATH.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> you just have to take it day by day.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> if you have to ask then you are......
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> but what matters is the guys attitude & performance during the deed..lol

<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> Yes there is that word that women throw at men all the time.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> the one catch is that you have to get up and do something!!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> it is okay to talk .
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> to much make up looks bad.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> u will know if u cant go without talking or seeing or thnking bout her for a secound.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> Just do what you think is best.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> she is gonna do what she wants no matter what you say unless you threaten her.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> you sound like you like him a lot.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_20> im single, but i'm a girl sry lol
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> But, that does not mean he is in love, or loves you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Hope you get it worked out.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> explain it to her that u were out of your world when that happened.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> abusive dose not just mean hitting, it also means verbally, emotionaly, or/and pschologley (spelling is bad, sorry).
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> Enjoy highschool while your in there.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> sorry but there aren't lot of girls with their photos.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> I also work with her every day & she reminds me of it each day...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> don't ignore her and just pass by.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> good luck and do not do this.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> you gonna have to play cat and mouse on this situation.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> i had one deleted for adult content i said SE*...like six
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> IF I FEEL SOMETHING SPECIAL FOR HER, I WOULD!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> if your thinking of other women then who is thinking of your wife?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> If your marriage is so bad that you are cheating.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> I think he was though, mainly cause most girls suck at picking guys.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> And then theres me which i'm not racist, but i just like black or dark skinned guys better.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> How could you cheat on your wife and then How could you ruin your girlfriends life
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> email me if you can christine_chicago@yahoo.com
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> He always says: Life is long..... and I see it the completely opposite way.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> i wish i had a swing like that in MY backyard...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> I don't know I have to meet you first!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> you dudes on here might wanna rethink your answers and questions!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> But I consider myself the most mature out of my friends who are 21 also.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Do people have to be married to have sex?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> GIVE HER A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN IF SHE DOES.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> sex after marriage is an old idea ???
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> But I consider myself the most mature out of my friends who are 21 also.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> Do people have to be married to have sex?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> GIVE HER A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN IF SHE DOES.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> sex after marriage is an old idea ???
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> wih romance sometimes comes love, but with love there should always be great romance
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I am in general doing pretty well, it is just I feel weird about telling people.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> Your best bet is to ask him whats up!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> as close as she feels comfortable with.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Don't come out and say i'm in love w/ u and i'm dying to jump on u!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> Just know you're really in love!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> I just want to know is it okay to date younger guys?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> There's a big age difference, uhm... very big.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> But there might be someone there that u might not know about.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> Like you said your ex-gf married a 65 year old for MONEY.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_50> walk her to her lock or something.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> 1. it's hard to find true friends these days.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> guys like a girl who makes the first move.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> NO GEEKS WOULD SO BORE ME.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> just tell yourself, i know he loves me and i know i love him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If you ask him out & he says no, don't let it bother you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Thats all you need to do!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> What is she using the money for...her own self!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> and is there any way on changing their minds?
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_25> You wanna call him or her?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> i been in a relationship for 6yrs.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> Guys...u know when ur girl is on her period and she really doesn't wanna do anything, right?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> wow sister you are in a tough spot!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Maybe u and miss who wants to be my friend should get together.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> iam male of age 23 .Pl help me !!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> The both of you would probably be better off if you forgot about him!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> hey what's wrong with being thick?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> too long and you can get hurt with that thing, too short and you can't feel anything.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> Or' you can beat him with a frying pan to teach him not to fu** with you again:)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> ...because, for a lot of them, it is very trendy and en vogue right now....ask any psychologist!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> leave him now or, find out the hard way.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> she says she doesn't like him, but i know for sure that she does.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> not physically but mentally .... yup!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Your Cheating your Wife.. and ruining your girl friends life as well.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> well what address did it come from?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> pretty much whenever you really like someone, 12 or above
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> a vacation for just the two of you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> the majority of woman beaters won't fight a man.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Dont worry tho the right guy will come along and like u for u not ur looks.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> fourth of all, it may be best to go after another guy.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> that all depends on the girl who's getting the ring.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> don't call him, wait for his call.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> I sometimes think of kissing a girl but I think I just can't do it in real life.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> People are just different, especially men and women.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> BUT....skip all of that if you don't know what i mean.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> God made them that way so us men would have something to post on yahoo answers
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> An example: my friend had a big argument with someone my BF knows...well over 3 years ago!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> I also wonder about the same thing sis!
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_30> Then do so, even if you only drive around the block!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_50> it is something that just is wrong.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> it might turn out to be the best relationship u've had.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> Does this mean what im thinking it means?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> BUT CALL HIM USING YOUR CALLING CARD.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> You go girl and forget about that jerk.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> wait untill somebody else tells you
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Does a guy that do that really love you?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> dont worry if he was interested he will call.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> But if she says shes going to kill herself, DON'T BELIEVE HER!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> Oh, but wait, you already gave it up to that guy....what was his name...back in high school?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> Baby, some times that works great.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> keep in mind that u two are siblings once in ur life and that can never change!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> BUY HIM SOMETHING FROM VICTORIAS SECRET, THAT YOU WEAR.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> being too sensitive then that is pretty messed up.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> First of all, if you love somone you want them to be happy right?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> Get out while you can girl.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> still wud advice u to be cautious .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> It is THE worst thing you could ever do.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> it's all about conversation, really .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> keep looking he is probably  a cheater.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Go hang out, hear some nice free music/poetry, get yourself a cup of joe and introduce yourself.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> The sad thing is that us guys are doggs, and were pretty much after some easy p*ssy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> what do you do when you have a friend thats a girl but you want to make it more
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> FIRST OF ALL, YOU NEED TO SERIOUSLY TALK TO YOUR HUSBAND.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> march of last year, he lived in a 3 bedroom apt.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> when you cant stop thinkig bout this person he/she is always on yor mind
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> have have a question about him its does chris woody really like me.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> people have fetishes and they deserve 2 have them fillfiled.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_50> the answer is not A or B it is E and Z
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> Then you have a choice to make, don't you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> I have a strange feeling that baby daddy don't like to be with one lady.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> because they get a lot of attantion that you see and you wish you could get that attation
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> keep shoppin till you find the pair that fit right in all aspects.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> But if she doesn't the you'll know.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> are 23 year old men immature?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> yea wat r u waiting for go for it GIRL!!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> ALL ANSWERS TO LIFE'S WHY'S AND HOW'S CAN BE FOUND IN TIME.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Love and lust do not go hand in hand.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> GET UR BUTT OFF THE COMPUTER AND FIND ONE!!!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> there goinna be a lot of ugly girls in there seventies with all these silicon crap lol!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> i love him and want to be with him and he is supportive and cares about my children.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> I need God more, though... without him...
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_25> it would kill u if u dont.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> love is when you really care, protect, listen, get along with, and like a person.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> chat online if you are lonesome!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Also depends on you cuz Im jealous and i wouldnt want her to say been there done that.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> if you like him well do it!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> I'm looking for a word I don't see there 'monogomous'.
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_25> new boy friend will do it for you
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_15> IF YOU LOVE HIM, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO OVERLOOK THIS AND TAKE HIM FOR WHO HE IS.
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_35> no dont do it unless shes a total bitch!
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_10> I PERSONALLY ENJOY BEING COMMITTED, SINGLE IS OK BUT ONLY SO MUCH YOU CAN DO BY YOURSELF.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> I FELT LIKE A LOST PUPPY ROAMING AROUND NOT KNOWING IF I WAS IN THE RIGHT SPOT.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> STOP TALKING ABOUT IT AND TELL HIM!!!!!
<NbChars_285> <LevSim_25> nm i don't want to know.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> if you really loved your boyfriend you wouldnt need anyone else.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> Think about and then be honest with yourself...
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> then do as some unwise person said, give it up when he asks you.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> try and surround yourself with people who truly love you and care about you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> She /he will always be there for you no matter what.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> I like it too and i thought i was the only one!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Some enjoy it a lot but some don't.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Tell ur husband if she like her frankly Good luck......
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> ashly dont go out lookin 4 tru love, it shood really come 2 u .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Your way too good for him.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> well i need answers from someone with experience
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> u can't wait for a formal invite forever ;)
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> i know, it's a cruel, cruel world.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> You should only have sex with someone you love!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> if yes then she is a sl*t!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> they are locked in her car.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> this boy we are clos but just friends everything alike
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Oh my goodness...You truly want to wait.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> YOU NEED TO KNOW YOU CAN MAKE IT.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> It even rained on my wedding day and I wouldn't change that either.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> find a nice pet and some friends.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> strip off all your clotes throw him on the bed and fuck him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> share a secret and see how far it goes
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> You dont want to spend your life asking  What If
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> mmmm why don't you tell him you had a date and he's not invited!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> act cool but not dorky cool.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Guys today like girls who are assertive.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> If there is doubt, get the heck out!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> I personolly think your in love.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> and i knew that he was the guy that i had drempt about, about 1 year before.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> My husband always keeps himself well groomed; he smells sooo good, NO nose hairs, hair trimmed; washed; and combed.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> If both are fine with it, then it is OK  living la vida loca  :)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> MAIL ORDER BRIDE  Then let them do the whole wedding thing
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> if there wasn't then why did Christ die on the cross for us?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> HE SAYS HE LOVES ME AND WANTS TO BE WITH ME BUT HE DOESN'T ACT LIKE HE LOVES ME.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> I should know, being a man and so...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> Throw tradition out of the window... girls ask guys out more and more every day.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> MY HUSBAND HAS OCD AND HE DOES THINGS LIKE CHECK THE LOCKS,HE DOES THINGS MULTIPLE TIMES.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> The next time it could mean prison time for him.....AND YOU.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> yeah from what i've heard they do
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I do prefer bigger girls and I do prefer brunettes.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> I told the guy I liked, that my friend liked him, but she really doesn't!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> look in yahoo people finder or names data / google
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> no matter how bad you want to advance.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> You're just looking for someone to tell you it was OK.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> hmm nope haven't had any dreams like that before
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> And usually from then on, they're thinking about the first person that they ever had sex with.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> what the hell game are you playing?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> i've heard they have bigger packages than asian men.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> you probably have some good resaons
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> Find yourself the first hot looking ho and bang her like a salvation army drum!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> a guy needs to be a lil taller than me but i usually fall fo short ones lol
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> One friend of mine, even got married.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> I cannot believe that you live with him already!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> What is not adultery,  sex between man and wife.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> Start hanging out and it should go pretty good from there!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> Then it felt dirty and made me sick.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_20> (this was something I did right)  For every choice (dress, banquet hall, etc.)
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> all over dont be afraid to talk
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> or their love can go deeper then that?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> dont ruin something that u fought for so hard.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> becoz as u said he moved on immediately.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> you can tell him I think you blew it,SEE YA
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> I bet with a little smile you are a dream.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> or try to get him back.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> And do not tell where you are moving to.LoL!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> I try to stick with that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> right now iam living with my parents.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> No she is not a friend unless you had already told her that it was okay.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> stay, because if they're your soul mate love would be all that matters.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Treasure your family and all you hv now!~ argument is just a dust compare to the whole universe!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> yes, respect her as a sister and set aside that fight for your sister to be happy,
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> I guess because all girls are cheaters too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> go to the lewis store and buy him a fascinating jeans..
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> You could always ask him :-)
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> never had one yet(well kinda wen i was 11 but not really)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> WOMEN JUST NEED TO TELL A MAN WHAT SHE LIKES AND THE MEN ALL WANT TO KNOW, TRUST ME.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> if flirting doesnt work, move on to somebody who will be interested in you.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> while most women say things much nastier; like we are dating their little brother or something.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Blonde, light complxion, blue eyes, skinny B.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> If u makin friends here around or just gaining some knowledge frm chatroom then it is intentionally good.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> you don't want to get hurt if he says no.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> of course you should hang with a guy you like.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> try imagine that person stuck with you every single minutes of the day until the day you die...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> Let me tell you-my wife is a larger lady, and not at all easy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> money is tight and there are children involved.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Then try to pick up the pieces afterward so sad!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> and 350 is alot to spend on a bf of less than a year.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> i've heard different opinions from different people.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> some just want to rush things to put a baby on you thats not yours.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> good personallity... n sence of humer
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> of course it happens to me all the time
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> he does, he's just waiting 1 more year to avoid jailtime...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> some just dont want to be alone.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> you buy dinner one time and they will the next.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> maybe you should try and meet someone that doesnt go to the bar.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> if you don't then that just has problems written all over it.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_30> Why do you fart up juice?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> how old r u thats such an immature question
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> ya definiteli...this is da wae to show that he enjoy da sex that he had....
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> i personnally think that you should lay off the asphyxiation practices...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> I have alot of girl and boy friends.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> I don't like you try your luck to other girl...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> i was kinda loking for someone to.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Most guys only tell you they love you for one reason.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> i mean its just people loving each other :'[
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Explain exactly how u feel to ur wife and how important sex is to u.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> remember this,once you cheat, your more likely to do it agian.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> the features i look for in a guy are: sincerity, honesty, compassionand comprehension.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> I want to run to a friend and tell her about this great guy I've met.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> me:Well that's a dumb question to ask, no why would you want to anyway?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> it depends what kind of love your talking about?
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_25> sex is bad - don't have sex!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> was she related to josh penland?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> u should first know what it is...best of luck.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> After I came out so did about 3 or 4 of my other friends, so it could benifit.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> Nah, dump him, or he'll keep on oing it...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> well to bad your in chicago
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> you may even have to settle for mr right now
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> no cause it will make u weak
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> Don't let your head with ears get too swollen!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> She may be nice but she is way too nosy.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> The answear can only be found with in you....  Good Luck....
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> it would never work , We'd fight and I win
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> Listen, Im gonna keep it real with you aight.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> yep  but it doesn't mean i reject daily requests :p
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> A 21 year guy should not have started dateing a 15 year old Jail Bait girl.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> I guess I'm in the wrong place!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> NEVER GIVE OUT YOUR NUMBER, ANYONE CAN GET YOUR ADDRESS VIA YOUR PHONE NUMBER!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> Think about anything but what you are doing!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> She's got you on the backburner!!!!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_15> IF HES GOOD IN BED GO FOR IT!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> But alas I do not know where to start looking.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> dun scare she ur type of cup !
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> wait, and for sure dont call him, the whole thing is a game!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> keep him and just watch the fooball games with him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Well the good thing is that ya'll kids get along.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> If you keep moving the boundaries - how should she know what you really mean?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> he doesnt grin or show any emotion at all.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Not having any hair, makes her look...pre-pubescent, and that just seems wrong.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Guys today are wimps and wishy washy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> NOW THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE IT HAPPENS LIKE THAT WITH EVERYONE I KNOW.WHY?
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> For a girl, try late twenties.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> He says that im the right girl but hes to young.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> if she leaves, it means she doesn't want to go out with you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> ... because their partners don't know what to do to please the gal.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Actually I believe most women don't com.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_15> WELL GUYZ LOOK 4 BREAST AND BUTT IT TRU SORRY IF I OFFENDIDE U
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> go up to him and comfront him about ur feelings.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> on basis of which i can tell you u r doin bad or rite.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> U won't be able to get over it,u could only forigive him;If u want to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> If you are just trying to hurt them, no.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> you could always go on the show the bachelorette!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> and know whether s/he is really what u thought s/he is.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> I know I don't want to tell my mate everything I did in my past.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> been  there  done  that  seperated  now
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> :)   Anyways, you ask what Love is Blind really means.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> if they are afraid to let you know...they are too insecure for you to deal with.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> nothing is wrong with dating someone that is chubby
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> And short phone calls just to say I love you!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> If he doesn't like you, it would not be very much fun.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> If you're a kid, romance should not be an issue...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> did something bad happen on the trip?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Try out her idea of a little relationship & make it grow
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> put urself first just this once and maybe u and i will know what 2 do... good luck
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Guys have yall ever considered that as an option??
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> IF YOU ARE OUT OF LOVE THEN IT IS GOING TO TAKE A LOT TO BRING SOMEONE BACK...GOOD LUCK
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> All you do is stereotype about guys, trying to make girls looks like ANGELS, FYI, girls cheat too.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> I could not have said it any better!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> If no matter what the sex if someone says they would rather shack up and its better than marriage.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> Should I leave her and look for someone better??
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Chasey Lane... and do you really need a reason??
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> plain and simple a true friend wouldnt do that
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> and lick places you might not think he'll like(but he will)!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> Probably not I dont think i do.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> I feel like i'm ready for love.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> I guess that I am still old fashioned that way.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> and also rent meet the parents its just funny!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Be a big girl and do likewise.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> best bet is make a date of it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> certain std's can lay dormat for up too 7 yrs.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I see him at a bar I go to.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> introspect urself when u were his GF...did u burden him?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> He and his son do no wrong.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> I always feel so bad and I do apologize but I know the sting is still there.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Quit obsessing about it for starters.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> my boyfriend is 5 years older than me!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> MARRIAGE IS ABOUT FINDING YOUR PATH AND UNITING IT WITH ANOTHER TO MAKE ONE.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> well love makes u do crazy things...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> And there are so many flowers to choose from!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> your guy will surely be hurt if he finds out that you've been going out with this extra guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> If your friend is gay, you don't have a chance.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> And no, he won't notice you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> barbie.com but first ask dad or mom!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> you married your husband because you loveed him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If he gets a girlfriend she always gets mad cause she thinks we're too close.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> NO MA'AM YOUR ON YOUR OWN WITH THIS ONE
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> where do the average jane work?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> you also know that laying with same sex is a sin.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> then u must use ur talent.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> for others, it's like climbing Mt.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> yes well what my freind said lol
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> He sounds like he would be a lucky guy to have you!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> only guys that have the courage..if u dont make a move first, some1 else might!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> because its natural and you know your body best and knows what it likes!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> It's ok to miss your love and I hope he misses you to.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Dont get involved until u r absoluteley sure.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Don;t be like me and my boyfriend.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> do u want to deal with this the rest of ur life?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> how can i find him for a divorce?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> nevada city is where i sit
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> are u saying there unarractive because the guy isn't with u.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> just curious as to your thoughts!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> What ever you are doing, always do your best.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> LIFE IS WHAT YOU MAKE IT GOOD OR BAD AND SO IS A RELATIONSHIP ONLY THIS TAKES TWO.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> You have to be strong and tell him NO!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> (BYW, i work in the ER) there are diseases that this can also spread.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> I wouldn't exist, and neither would music!!!!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> buy that ring get down on your knee  and ask her to marry you do it this week
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> I think tattoos express how a person sees their life...and actually some tattoos are very sexy!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> but for now she is with you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> WHEN YOU ARE IN LOVE BELIEVE ME YOU WILL KNOW IT.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> I met a guy on net.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> But be prepared, if she just wants to be friends, she will not what to become more than that.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> frankie beverly 101....Joy and Pain are like sunshine and rain.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> fake ones are obvious and obnoxious looking.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> OK, girle - first, breathe !
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> If you really like this boy, I suggest you ask him if he likes you.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> im not the smartest person so dont anyone say report cards.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Hope you have fun with the wedding and with scrapbooking!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Once cheated, stupid me, twice cheated, stupid you I would think long and hard if he cheated on you.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> one who can keep a secret forever
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> and you'll get many girls with your moves.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> or am i just kidding myself?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> nowhere, all men are jerks one way or another.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> just do what you feel makes sense and don't second guess yourself.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> It's not cool to write like this, it just makes you look lazy.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> I think it makes them look more dangourous..lol..
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> no theres nothing wrong in pleasuring yourself
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> And I just can't see myself having the heart to hit her like I mean it.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> (if the guy has a clue at what he is doing)  they are all good for something.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> searching for boobs is not that much of a big deal.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> What u never had u can never miss, man, just let it go!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> I got three words for ya, Peeping Tom
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> No matter how much you love each other, 4 months it's still way too soon.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> you may wind up with no one
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> then i went home and never heard from her again.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> there are other fish in the sea!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> He always calls eventually, so maybe I should just wait it out...?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> * Everybody gets what they deserve!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> Thats not on my mind all day every day
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> think about it for a second, isn't self love so much better, it always gives back right?
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_40> your 14-15 N thinking about having sex?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> They kept whispering, Isn't that that odd customer?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> i m sure u will find one for u to marry.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> umm...you should just tell him, and/or give hints (meaning show that you care for him).
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> and who knows you might find someone your age and fall in love with him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> if u love something let him go,will come back?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> he never noticed how i felt about him, so go ahead and hang out!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> I think it's really cute :)!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> (He'll probly piss u off 2, every once in a while)
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> No its NOT OK to have relationship with old bed mates if you are married.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> ever since i been a little girl i've been attracted to girls.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> I, for one, think about whom I am having sex with.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> and don't play with her boobs all the time, makes of feel like u only want one thing.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> lots of gstraight guys like butt sex.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Try asking him to do this for you....
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> i cant even think of that.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo!
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> you can do anything you want
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> if ya think he is gonna-wait!!!!

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Not at all, unless she doesnt like it, or is not in the mood.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> BUT SOME WOMEN ARE TO SCARED TO TELL THE MAN SO THEY NEVER HIT THE RIGHT SPOT.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> Wear one of my t-shirts with nothing else.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> He swears its over now(mostly because i always found out)and swears he loves me.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Only if I thought it would lead to great make up sex!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> That would be a nice start.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> medium because its not to big or too small
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_40> maybe you sould make the first move guys love it
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> y do men love to have sexs???
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> GET YOURSELF A PRE-PAID CALLING CARDS FROM YOUR LOCAL WALMART / TARGET STORE.
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_30> Like them for who they are.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> first kiss - 9.  first date - 14
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> if they forgive you, then they are a friend true- blue!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> i dont have this problem im only in highschool.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> you should keep them above your head actually
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> there is a lady who i know who i love to meet but i am afraid she might laugh
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> Should I say goodbye, or try and get over the fact that I hurt him so bad?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> Girl show him u got balls just like him, KICK HIS ASS TO THE CURB AND FIND SOMEONE BETTER!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Or buy him a nice shirt.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> do a people search..sometimes it costs about 10-20, but it works
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> I could go on and on.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> well if its your house to i wouldn't put up with it.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> Go to the Church... before it's too late
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Well, u see most guys get serious about relationships when they get 23.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> what do you get the perfit guy
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> Eat it if you do, throw away if you don't.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> you will know it in your heart, you can tell alot by looking someone in the eyes
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> i'm doing great, how are you?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> you are at a good age,19 and 24, that is sexy.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> because boys drive us crazy and they get on our nerves.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> that might be a turn-off to women.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> I even caught my ex at it!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> well it deppends how old you r
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> I would prefer that you find the perfect guy to spend the rest of your life with.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> why did you break up in the first place?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> Depending if the guy is really who he says he is.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> it is good to have advice in this topic coze i was about to ask similar q any way.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> if that's not the case then i dunno.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> IF HE REALLY MISSES YOU HE WILL CALL YOU.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> !it is how you use it!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> and we hated keeping that secret.we both ended up getting hurt in the end.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Is it ok to have guy friends even though your man doesn't approve.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> you should sit both of them down and about it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> But if she gives up on you she dont care for u that much.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> AND FROM THAT POINT ON YOU WILL KNOW WAHT LIFE IS ALL ABOUT.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> u might b ugly and not all woman like other woman
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> I say this from a personal experience so either take it or just throw it to the ocean... ;-p
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> How can I tell if she still does?
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_20> or find sum other hott person to have a drunken one-night stand with?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> i do,my cousin is the hotest guy on earth.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> - She's in love with someone else.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> But why are you asking him!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> get her a ring, get down on one knee, and ask, will you marry me?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> This guy seems like a jerk.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> get a NEW some one fast
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> sssshhhhhh dont tell him he will think i'm weard
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> things happen and you were just afraid.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Books like SMART LOVA CAN HELP!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> why would anyone want to get married.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Also i have this in my office P.C.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> I think it really depends on the guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i have no problems with sensitivity.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> i have the same problem with this one boy named chris woody.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> More proof that women collectively DON'T REALLY GIVE A RAT'S @SS about men.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> probably for the same reason white women crave black guys?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> i have the same problem with this one boy named chris woody.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> AS a guy I must admit that the quiet inocent type don't typicaly stand out.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> if yes, answer this, did u tell your friend before they started dating or whatever they are doing?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> More proof that women collectively DON'T REALLY GIVE A RAT'S @SS about men.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> probably for the same reason white women crave black guys?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> does he do nice things for you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> All guys are not cheaters, many women cheat also.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS, HAPPENS FOR A REASON, now she has someone shes happy with, and i'm very much happy.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> btw, havent u been cheating ......
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> so i say, if it's ment to be you will know...and time has no bearing.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> She undecided so you choose no:)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> In other words she probably goes down on him when your not watching
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> Damnit, what's wrong with you people ???
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> thats like my bf and me.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> she'll begin to treat you like shit.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> because the majority of men want  or have more than one girl
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> if you call him then youll seem desparate, and he'll feel like hes a player!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> but dont sound obvious about it.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_50> If he want to call he will.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> i kno ita a 50/50 between guys cheating!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> converation might just dwell on the latest botique, hair salon....men wont relate.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> (for example......is she holding a soccer ball, tennis racket, ATV keys, dog leashes, baby stroller, grocery cart??)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> I dunno if there is something wrong with me or what but I need advice...Please give me ur words
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> I have a big family and I love it!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> i wonder if men realize the effects that heartbreak can leave.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> But if they are truely, acting a fool then don't worry, everyone else will notice.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> well does ur crush know that u have a crush??
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> Maybe I'm wrong but seems about right to me!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> (I wouldn't put it past her) If she lied to about that, then what else is she lying about?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> My Ex is an a** and I am just kind of wondering why??
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> for under 18 years its so bad,but for anyone as you i guess its so good,for kissing it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> trustful always incourage me in doing good things
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Alot of people have the time off!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> this much <___________________________>  no more, no less.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> definetly not you definetly need to look for someone up your alley of age
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> If he broke up with you, that sux.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Not to mention fake a_ _ profiles.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Did you forget they are male ???
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> So you can hurt people you love.....
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> so it realyy depends on your feelings for her,
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> Someone that wont smother them and some one that is good looking
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> using 2 instread of to, u instead of you, ur instead of your only means a couple of things.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> in extreme cases (the person has a problem w/ drugs or alcohol) the silent treatment will not work.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> id be careful about who u give your number 2. id meet him before id give it 2 him.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_10> (SORRY FOR THE CAPS MY KEYBOARD IS NOT WORKING LOWER CASE)
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> tell her what you just typed.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> and im not gay im a straight female:)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Must be something really big if you even think about not going to her wedding.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> we leave for lunch, and she can't find her keys.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> But guys, i want to know what u think?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> well it simple to prove it
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> am i abnormal?and what do u think about him?
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> for the two of you to become lover or just friends.
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_25> odds are you are just her meal ticket.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Because she likes him and has done it with him...I'm telling you she's hidding something!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> i liike a girl but she thinks that i'm crazy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> it doesn't matter if you love him .
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> I think about 3 times a week
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> Hi Annyian, nice to meet you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> My wife so busted me once way back when we were dating.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> First, I want a woman, not a girl.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> you don't have to find it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> And of course you have a right to do this!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> alright the first answer was obviously from a girl, and i feel your pain man.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> you gotta look inside yourself and see if you really do still love him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Then she said- I had the best time, thanks!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> you don't have to find it.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_25> you gotta look inside yourself and see if you really do still love him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> u were not in love to begin with.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> you need to go uncheck that area where it ask for adult content allowed or not
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> Now that I know this, it is killing me inside.
<NbChars_265> <LevSim_10> THE PERSON YOU LEAST EXPECT MAY BE THE ONE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> My guy and I are still together :)
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> at my school there are like 5 or 6 asians and I actually get along with all races.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Find a guy that wants you for you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> the person i was cheating with told him.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> I think girls: butt and Abs Guy want abs and chest
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Hire cheaters tv show, ne way there is no way b/c your own insecurities come into play.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> just tell them u love them sometimes words can mean more
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> none fo ur bees wax so give up on meeting the ladies idiot
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> I think flirting is nature and I don't care what anyone says, everyone does it from time to time.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> REMEMBER BE NICE TO HIM .
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> Irritated or not, I'm getting mine!LOL
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> Probably not, but you know stranger things have happened.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> I think it is all an excuse that they are tired.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> plan for any snafus and traffic.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> if i have had s*x with an employee before?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> tell him how u really feel n make sure he understands where ur coming from
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> Love going come when u really need it;cause i know.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> I think your man is just jealous and insecure.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> It's not like girls are gonna kill them or something.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> Sick mided.......... my friend:no, and i never would.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> well who hasn't done it before.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> take no for an answer if she gives it to you.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Get on with your life sweetie, before it is gone.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> Males are ugly, pigs everywhere you go!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Thickness.......a long pencil isn't that great!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> lol yes i think so... does that make me weird?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Just wondering if there are other men who prefer the couch?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> if yes, forget your friend, but sorry, there is nothing u can do about it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> There are two guys that  like me.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> Thats what I had to do, and I don't feel a bit bad about it!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> tell her its time to help or leave
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> feed your couriosity, but be careful.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> hot pink does it for me...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I can't imagine that he wouldn't be.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> u jst come 2 the right place
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Some are mature at 20, others just never grow up.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> That girl is getting married now.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> which begs the question, is it wrong when a woman gives it up on the first date?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> Go ahead and move on yourself and don't you dare look back.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> HAVE HIM GIVE YOU HIS PHONE#!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> So many men, so little time!

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> get therpy or a lovely linda doll!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> Then dress up if you feel that way!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> Sex is fantastic with the one you love.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> doubt it, it should be the person not the hair color.....

<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> we learned it from our mothers

<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> 1nce u do it a few times u wont b so nervouse.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> *SIGH* I think he needs to come on here and get some better excuses!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> you just have a different love interest.
<NbChars_280> <LevSim_30> sometimes the waiting can change you
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Give yourself time to get over it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> if you are not a nigerian and not in nigeria then let me know your location
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> I hope it works for you!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> is that showing him that i do love him if i put up with it?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Be yourself but if that doesn't work nakedness is always an option.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> IF U THINK IT IS THEN YES
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> Well I'm sure you want to be in shape too don't you?

<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> he should b committed to her or not be with her.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> yes......this was my date from hell!!
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> try it and u tell us
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Pick up the phone and give him a call, it will make you both feel better  :)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Us women are a lot like men, in the sense that we get a hard on too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> you should be looking for a manfriend.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> BTW thanx for your response to my question
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> to heck with that /&#92; !
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> i would still love you because youre the same person.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> You just seem to be going after stupid men.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> If your a Guy, as soon as she askes for it!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> So shy, goofy guy meets Miss Saigon and, Bang!, happy ending all around.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> hmm the problem seems to be u dint tell him about us.......
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> if someone hurt their love then it all about loving itself more than the other.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Hey I might sound cruel, but I am not.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> your acting stupid,   maybe you shuld marry him.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> it's best to use a condom no matter what.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Nope but I do have a sexy birthmark.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> Do fun stuff like ice-skating or something that might not sound exactly like exercise.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> Do you NOT want sex all the time?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> because our parents gave us names n other parents did the same so that is our parent's fault
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> that is bad news...well r u still friends?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> what different do it may?what's it to u?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> Obviously you flirt back, or he still wouldn't be flirting!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> one coupon for kisses and hugs...you get the picture.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> well i think that my guy cousins are cute but i never liked any of them
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> But she didn't notice me like that, and I knew it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> one you have to convince that you love them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> me - 22, her - 18... We're friends...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> longer, should have left long time back, but if u love him, stick it out & c...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> so theres this girl who said she only wants to have a little relation ship with me.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_35> If not then think of a comprimise...like maybe not watch but join.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> its not everyday you get a feeling like this...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> MOST of my friends are men.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> they have to make the marriage work.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> and yes im still a virgin.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> trust me u aint missing nothing from a man.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If he's interested in you, he will do some flirting back.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> do you think if he really loved me he would do that?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> i also wanna know how 2 change that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> i can under stand ur feeling, love is so sensitive,handle b4 it hurts us...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> sounds like puppy love to me!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> give him flowers  ask him out to eat
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> there should be always some rules.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_40> Get a life because it doesn't...Nicky
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Mmm... That sounds like it could be fun!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> After reading others repsonses, ARE YOU GUYS CRAZY?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> If a bunch a guys are hanging around you then you're probley are a pretty cool chick.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Do things to keep you busy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> IF YOUR SECOND GUESSING YOURSELF THEN DEFINITLY NOT.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> not hating them helps if its a loner
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> The guy friend that I am looking for I have been friends with for about 6-7 years now...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> If you love him you should trust that he would not do anything to hurt you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> ive known a few quiet and innocent girls who got the best pick  keep it innocent boys like that!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> you get a feeling YOU'LL KNOW if he is the special one or not
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> You if you don't say it, either your or her if you do.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i've been there more than once!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> if i spent my life with people exactly like me, i never would have learned anything.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> no, its not men or women being dishonest.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> first don't buy a cell phone unless you have a ring on your finger.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> if it hurts than you still love him
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> o and give him hell about it for the next year.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Death:-  Years passed, I looked down at the coffin of a girl who used to be my 'best friend'.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> maybe cut back on the time you spend with him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> most boys i know are really shy so they don't come up to other girls often.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> well there is a difference between looking for boobs or  another girlfriend.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> will i ever forget him ?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> Girl you are posing the same question I did not too long ago!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> Finally my boyfriend came to me and I'm happy 4 once.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> But if I had to pick, girls generally seem to like eyes and butts.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> make him realize ur serious about being friends.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_10> SO MOSTLY JUST LOOKING FOR GUY FRIEND TO TALK ONLINE HERE AND TO CHAT ONCE IN WHILE HERE?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> then that kinda person should be avoided.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> If youre serious about bein in love with her she probably, wont laugh.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> since then i have vowed never to cheat on another woman.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> I dont think there is anything wrong with it
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> he says this is what is keeping us apart.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> yes for some... i love it
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> the time will show u the answer of ur question
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> because it used to happen to me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> as for the cheating on with uglier parteners.. that is 100% not true.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> look at them.you'll get major butterflies if u love them.If u don't love them break up
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Wish you the best in life-may God bless you for ever ............
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> It's not that he wants to have sex with YOU, he just wants to have sex.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Yes girl find out all you can, after all its your world that man is entering.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Think about what if YOU were the one with the missing legaments..etc.?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> big ones or small ones doesn't matter.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> They are full of nutcases, freaks and wierdos!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> but it's worth it, even when it fails.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> try to drop the bomb casualy and just start talking (or writing notes in class) and just say hey!?!?!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Hi, darlin', my name is Cowboy... remember that name  because you're gonna be screaming it alllll night...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Well, girlie, there is no good reason to cheat, so forget it!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> would it be selfish of me to tell him to get out?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> he would tell me about wild partys he had attended and had wild sex.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Wouldn't you want to have sex with someone who really cares about you?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_95> wish you the best of luck.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> but if i leave i get everything back but no lace to stay what should i do
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> IF SOMEONE HAS BAD OPINIONS ABOUT YOU, THEY DONT MATTER ANYHOW.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> Let me know how it goes!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> and he bought me drinks and snacks during the game.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> shes asian but thinks asian guys are too short and look like aliens.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> brake up shes not worth your time
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> don't do anything drastic- just pretend that you lost something of theirs.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> or  *Are u indifferent (don't care)?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> her dog just wanted to pick a fight with mine.
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_30> don't get it be more specfic and i'll try again!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But don't let it be your cardinal rule...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> TELL HIM WHAT U LIKE AND WHAT U DON'T.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> In the back of my mind I expected him to walk out on me again.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> They do, you just have to wait for the boys to grow up ;)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> just start makeing out with him and say lets have sex
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> but i do know from expierience.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> yes  but you did not say who  I love 4 children all at once
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> he may think your weird, but if he duznt kno u it cant be that bad.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> If anybody ever tells you that size doesn't matter they are lying.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> NO MATTER WHAT YOU THINK OR FEEL, IT WON'T WORK, IT WON'T WORK, IT WONT WORK.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_15> I HOPE I HELPED YOU ALITTLE AND GOOD LUCK!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> FOLLOW YOUR HEART AND NOT YOUR MIND YOU HEART WILL NEVER LEAD YOU WRONG.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> I live here....And most of them have money and are really good looking.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> right, i like the answer above, she covered it all
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> having faith two poeple who are willing to work together
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> some just want to find em f@#$k em then flee em.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> The girl I had wrongly fell in love with in H.S.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> once a week and i have to frucking beg for it its why ive had two affairs, wanted affection
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> Not at all, unless YOUR religion prohibits it.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> Just my .02 cents...actually worth far less!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> I'm 30 and kinda wont to date a younger guy, maybe 23 to 25.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> He might be a total nutcase!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Unless of course you are both single and there is a chance both of you are reinterested.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> Girls tell guys that she doesnt like him when the guys proposes to the girl...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> try joining a book club or somthing like that
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> My boyfriend said he loved me and I believed him.
<NbChars_250> <LevSim_30> if u want him and he's free whats stoping u?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_15> WHY DO YOU GET MARRIED IF IT IS NOT GOING TO LAST AT ALL THERE  HMMMMMMMMMM?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> take a wild shot in the dark on why we have names.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> so be awear of guys in high school.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> hope i helped and good luck!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Her mom and dads full-size sit-down shower.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> and do what your heart tells you 2 do.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> If he starts acting like you have full blown HIV, you know what I mean?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> (If he did, he would definaely wait too.)
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> has your friend ever been jealous, this could just be her way to break you up.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> i know your thinking what do you know?
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_40> I would never steer your wrong..Goodluck
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> ask the guy what kind of relationship does he want because you are getting mix signals.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> that's a once in a lifetime oppurtunity.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> I don't know what you mean by mistreat.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> THERE HAS TO BE GOOD COMMUNICATION ALWAYS.NEVER STOP TALKING TO EACH OTHER EVEN IF YOU ARE UPSET.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> You should be gettin signals if shes in to you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> communicaton is one of the things that got u 2gether so use it 2 keep u 2gether.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> First u need to check his/her identity.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> Wish you the best of luck
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> no, being sensitive is just expressing the way you feel.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Is that what's best for your kids?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> !but im not generalizing here, some guys still have enough decency in their bones
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Split her chest cavity open and there it is!
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_25> Forget all that stuff what happeneds happends just think about the moment and her.. Good Luck!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> WHEN U FIND OUT PLESAE LET ME KNOW(LOL)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> yes... always be honest, no matter what.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> no there is nothing wrong its in out Blood!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> Geesh there are an awful lot of good looking guys here!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> I went with my gut feeling and i was right.It will all come out!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> I think Rose16 is right, but it is good to love everyone;)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> my girlfriend said she would trust me, and i never cheated again.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> i think( not sure) that u should wait atleast some weeks!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> I never bring anyone around my daughter.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> It depends...are you still friends...then talk about it...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> I think its 16/17 for girls, 18/19 for boys.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> If you are a guy ask yourself an honest question:  What was your first real toy?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> If she hestitate, just leave her and forget about the guy you like.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Koffee,  I've always said that I trust my gut before I trust anything I hear, see or read.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> if you want too...  but you have to face the consequence....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> buti want more than a little crush so what do i do
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> but b prepaired 4 him 2 go else where.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> Hey, thanks for the great stereotyping, ladies.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> Sometimes guys seem more fun to hang out with because they arent as girly as some girls can be.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> or he's always trying to get closer to you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> if a guy has a problem with his gf, wife, ect.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> i have the same question,some men are just plan senseless to feamle feeling
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> BUT BUT BUT Why is it a big deal when the guys tell it to a girl??
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_35> im sure hed do it 4 u.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_50> yea let him get to know you
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> giving a simple gift often, but unexpected.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> Guys don't care about the new fancy resturant that opened up at $150 per plate .
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> The website might help, it's not religous or creepy at all!
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_25> english & grammar...you can do it!
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_30> yes, if the guy is not...
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> this is ez..... wait until he/she  ask you for it....After Hi is too soon.......after bye is too long..
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> it sounds a really nice but shy guy has a crush on you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> If she hit it off with this guy, maybe you should get over it and be happy for her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I see it at work, in the streets, why is that?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> But if she will start justifying then?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> yes i am if you need to write me you could e-mail me is nerlande14@yahoo.com
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> i would talk to him and tell him what you do like and what you don't like.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> I wanted her to be mine, but she didn't see me like that, and I knew it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> If you are with a woman who also likes it, then go ahead!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> ef u dont then u will never kno.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> well kiss like you are really in love with that peorson
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> If you are a man and married then it is ok BUT,  2.)
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_20> 6 1/2 or so I read
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Don't let it drag on though.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> yes i did that once and now i wish i would have said yes to him
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> you approach her by walking up to her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> When in love you want to give and give and give and give......and to heck with ever taking!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> That being sadi...I have dated the quiet girl that was AWSOME to be with.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> This is going to ruin her(your wife's) life.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> already i succeeded a little bit.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> I certainly don't think it's OK for her to secretly have those type friends behind your back.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> I agree with MOST* of comments here...there has to be more too it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> and u know u dont want that.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> but if ya wanna & that guy happens 2 b him, well then idk .
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> I like any girl who's pretty.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> oh hell yeah, i'm sure she'd understand.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> Because guys like it...my mind's in the gutter...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> if you love each other and you all have your feet on the ground, youll make it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> 7yrs ago i had a male friend who was very loose with sex.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_40> Sit him down, don't even mention his X.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> but it is all up to u if u want to change for life.
<NbChars_270> <LevSim_35> but don't expect me to pay .
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> give him a black eye and tell him to stay away from her
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Is this the same with guys??
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> that is what u like go for it.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> it doesnt hurt to try it out, if it doesnt work u can always move on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> i like those kind of dreams.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> It's gotta be-  Baby you're so fine, I'd drink a TUB of your bathwater
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> she closed her eyes and want to closed with you
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> for them until it's to late.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> if we didn't it would be very confusing
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> i am sooo glad i'm not in your situation.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> it depends on the guy...and just how shy the girl is.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If you loved him you wouldn't think that he was ugly.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> LOL Georgio you da luv stud hehehe
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> im single and the only guys in my school that like me are all real jerks.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> The best man I'll ever have in this life!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Unless you have a reason, if there is any way for you to get out, you should!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> Tough guys get promoted a lot (e.g.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> she asks if i am faithful?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> its important 2 b able 2 relax cuz that really isnt the best time 2 clinch up.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> KNOWING YOUR PARTNER IS ALSO A MUST,WHAT MAKES THEM TICK, HOW DO THEY SPEND THERE TIME, E.T.C.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> You should marry him if he is in Mil.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> if u love him ull try.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> yup, and this moment don't will be i forget in my life
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> but thats got nothing to do with the question.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> yuck....please be a pseudo-nymn and not a real preacher??!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> And what's nicer, a real or fake boobs?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Wrong because this will definitely gonna cause trouble in your relationship.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> american men are seen as more powerful.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> And what's nicer, a real or fake boobs?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> Wrong because this will definitely gonna cause trouble in your relationship.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> american men are seen as more powerful.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> If you need to use some lube (like ky) or something.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> how about shy guys n shy gals dating!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> MEN LIKE BEING TOLD WHAT TO DO TO A WOMAN TO MAKE HER COM.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_10> DONT DO OR SAY ANYTHING THAT WILL PUSH HIM AWAY
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> Just trust her and love her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> even when its in your mouth, swirl that tongue!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> If she says she likes someone else that means she is shop'n.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> NOT IN MY OPINION BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE LOOK REALY GOOD WITH THERE WEIGHT.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> 28-34 is the age range I want but they are either waaaay too young, or waay too old.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> then go up to him and say hi!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Though I have to admit I have a lot of friends that have.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> I see you do not PLAN to have sex, but things DO happen.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> if you are really a preacher aren't you NOT supposed to be partaking in fellatio and stuff like that??
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> right now i have to tell someone i still love them so i dont hurt THEM.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Of course it's ok to have guy friends.

<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> She is just so hot and she knows exactly what she is doing.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> i am a cheerleader and i am original on different levels.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Also remember that sleeping around rouins reputations  What ever you do have fun and enjoy life!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> But I say that love, if you truly do love him, always deserves a fighting second chance.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> i am looking for a true lover  but i don't live any where near you
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> Because guys like you makes us kick yall's asses which make you say, Oh wow, girls suck.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> have u ever told ur friend u like him?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> where can i get printable free marriage contract online?

<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> thats what i was explaining to someone today.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> if u did not leave him 5 yrs ago then let it go.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> ITS DUE TO HIGH CONTENT OF FAT AND CHOLESTROL,
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I think it is just their way of saying, I have travelled, so I KNOW!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> would you like to join us?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> :) What do YOU think Love is Blind means??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> and then wrap up some chocolate syrup, whip cream and a blind fold.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> he probably likes you but is just too scared to come up and talk to you though.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> I because i dont know you
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> But if you truly feel for the guy DO NOT risk it .
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> Because what qualities he/she is having u are not having & what you are having he/she is  not having.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> at home  p.s: woh the cemetary, that's innapropriate
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> what kind of question is that it will get deleted
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> MARRIAGE..... A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THAT MARRIAGE IS TO GET SOMEONE CAUGHT UP INTO THE WORLD OF RESPONSIBILITIES!.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> love is not just a word you said but its the air that you breath,
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> if he's fine yes, but its rape.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> if u and him both understand what the relationship is about & ur boyh ok w/it, yes.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> You need to tell her that this ain't working out with you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> The next day I got a phone call.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> Yes... it gives you a longer time to get to know how much you really like a person...
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> Make it really clear to him that you guys are together, and you don't share.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> dont interfeer if he is still interested hell let you know in some way!good luck
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Then you will really be asking quastions here  lol
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> Tell her how you fell dog!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> and being drunk is a poor excuse for anything.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> If you are under 4-feet tall don't bother answering!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> ask him out or wait until he grows balls and asks u out
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> :)   Take care and God Bless!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> And then – can you trust him?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> have a friend ake him if he likes you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> You recpect someone coz u love him/her or you love someone coz respect him/her..?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> this guy i like stares at me alot.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> it doesn't matter how much a wedding gift cost, as long as you think it's right
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> guys can't be alone for a month and a girl can!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> chat with her 4 a few days n later give her ur phone no.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> would you ever date thee opposition or thee enemy
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> throw it away didnt your parents teach you not to take candy from strangers
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> honesty humour and freedom ( space betwen us)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> I think if you ever had that right, you certainly gave it up when you got divorced.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> (i can't guarantee that these are all correct.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> that had sex on the first date?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> if you want to ask me out .
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> But that is just what happened with me.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> We are in our mid 50's and it just gets better with age...
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> when you would give up your life for someone if asked

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> u also have to reasure him hes being like that casue he doesnt want to lose u
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> but go with your gut feeling because its usually right.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> men who don't show any emotions just seem to hard and women love gentle kind sensative and emotions
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> It isn't weird or sexy, its just you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> if think they get shy around them.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> From what I read here: You love him and he loves you back, you want to get married.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> i think white guys and asian girls just go together pretty good.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> and has changed the way he is, cuz u urself has seen the changes.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> but she puts dat boi before me.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_10> ALSO SOME WOMEN ARE HIGHLY STRESSED WHICH MAKES  IT MORE DIFFUCULT TO COM.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> i like the big bangs OO.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> it's a total different thing to live it day in and day out.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> i cheated on my husband (now) for the first 3 months of uor relationship.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> i have been waiting and still the same excuse.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> asking what she likes rememberring her answers.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> just let go of the past.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> it's a total different thing to live it day in and day out.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> i cheated on my husband (now) for the first 3 months of uor relationship.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> i have been waiting and still the same excuse.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> asking what she likes rememberring her answers.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> just let go of the past.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Remember this too...men don't grow up till at least 35.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> if he asked you and you said no, then grow up, and think about why you said no.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> So you are bisexual, what does that mean, that you suck d)ck?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> dude, there's no day without night, no wrong without right.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Hang out with some girlfriends and talk to thim about this.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> will you have to go smoth
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> dont go finding a bf on the internet.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> If you really like her that much you have to persue her further.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> I did, so did allot of my friends.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> because their boyfriends ask them to(sorry)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Well i dont think thats most guy are scared of girls.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> ok...the best advice i can give you is breathe, and dont think about it that much.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Try to go out with ur mate's friends and bring ur friends along too.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> you can't just decide what features they come with.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> I cannot find any thing but black sleeevless dresses is this ok?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> wait to see what he thinks.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> ...so go out and find one!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Start acting like you could care less...drives women crazy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> If you are a man  and not mariied to the woman then it is bad
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> i have never cheated on him since.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> he'll have a link you can check out.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> i would be more concerned about tyler.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> you tell him that is yucky and ignor him forever
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> ok, well this makes me wonder if maybe he's like too big.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> On a girl, her legs, butt and waist.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> You beat the guy up she is cheating on you with, then you spit in your now ex-girlfriends face.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> Anyways... my advice is to ask him.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> You just have to be careful.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> You beat the guy up she is cheating on you with, then you spit in your now ex-girlfriends face.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> And you don't have to worry about getting cold!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Anyways... my advice is to ask him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> We don't suck U do.HA,HA,HA.Just kiddin U should stop watching soooooooo much tv.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> cause u love someone too much!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> make sure u use LOTS of lube.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> the colour can change on a daily basis what the heck does it proove
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_10> AND THAT ONE PATH WILL LEAD YOU ONTO BRINGING LIFE ONTO YOUR OWN.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> cause u love someone too much!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> make sure u use LOTS of lube.

<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> up on stage to get her diploma.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> talk to the prison priest if you can...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> But the ones that do do it for 3 reasons: 1.  because they think white men have money, 2.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Don't do nothing,  It might make it worst.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Being a virgin makes NO ONE sexy or weird.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> IT TIME IT SHOULD GET EASIER FOR YOU TO LOOK PAST(OR AT LEAST DEAL WELL WITH) HIS OBSESSIVNESS.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_25> I don't know what to do.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> or is he one of those flightly players?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> Go out with friends hang out with family jus have fun in other ways
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> it depends on how old your.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> Now he's always hanging around me, but not like just a friend.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> There all sorts of girls, some are right for you, others are not.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> That's the kindof guy that you would want.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> does he show u that he loves you?
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_50> what do u consider teen age.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> But try convincing a woman of that...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Sure i believe in love...i believe in cancer, too...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Shauna Grant... She was so beautiful, yet what a terrible tragedy!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> It's more like lust than anything.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> What a stupid question - is that honest enough for you?

<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> next time you catch him staring, ask him if you have a booger in your nose or something :)
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> To me I do not feel that you love him at all.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> hell nooooo!i,m brunette and i have lots of fun
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_50> Say HI then smile at her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> girls hold back better than guys do
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> I mean some guys really look good in red, some in black.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> say it in clear straight words:  I AM DUMPING YOU.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> may b coz he is attractive
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> DO NOT BE WITH HER WHAT IF SHE KISSES ONOTHER GIRL WHEN SHE IS WITH YOU.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> I hope I heped a little bit.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> your guy has to accept the fact that u got guy friends... doesnt he has female frinds?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> Keep this person out of ur head.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Heck yea, only girls grow up.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> 5 to 7 inches from what i have read.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> by themselves or by 'cool' friends).
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Why is it that women get so attatched and men don't give a rat's ass?
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> Alot of guys think the quiet innocent girls are just stuck up.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> always standing there when i see back.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> 5 to 7 inches from what i have read.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> by themselves or by 'cool' friends).
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Why is it that women get so attatched and men don't give a rat's ass?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Alot of guys think the quiet innocent girls are just stuck up.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> always standing there when i see back.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> But that's not WHY I love them.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> it depends... do you like your crushes crew?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> dont know im not corey ask him
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> after you have arrived you are not done, much more foreplay for her!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Why should I be the best man she ever met??
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> If it was about what he wanted you wouldn't be dumping him, you'd be his slave...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> HE'S EVERYTHING I'VE EVER WANTED IN A MAN.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> they know this probably and it's why they are so shy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Otherwise it would be okay to lie, steal and cheat, and murder and... well, you get it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> if you really like her you will tell her without worrying, if you don't how will you know otherwise?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> one who love me long time
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> That is a load of CRAP!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> you will find the right one.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> I just don't understand why they do that.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_25> im 26 and thinking of dating a 23 year guy.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> you just need more stronger feelings..and then you know when it's time
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Yes he will constalle bug u hit and smile or make face at u..
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> hire an assasin to kill her   (jus jokin)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> well, i hadn't believed that till i fell in love with a guy i'd never even seen.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> try a retirement home..maybe u can get a job there u lazy shit
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Think of her sense of humor, want it to be fun?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> is there someone else in bed with you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> first of all....did she knew you liked him??
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_45> after I got a new P.C.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> .........'I wish I did too...'  I thought to my self, and I cried.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> I'm not sure if it's gonna work.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> hope this helps, but you probably need practice.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> If a romance dosent work out then you lose a girlfriend and a friend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> and then there is the christian bunch that get married to have sex.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_20> Masturbate less... you'll become a Talking pro!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> But let me say this...they are NOT all like that.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> If you like sex, don't get married!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> not all guys are cheaters there are some that r honest out there you just have to keep looking
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> Forget him ave, im here for you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> this is just the quote of it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> if it is your wife, its okay.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> then he still kept calling her and lying.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> ok i live with my x i still have feeling for him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_10> HONESTY COMPASSION A GOOD EAR AND A STRONG SHOULDER TO LEAN ON
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> good luck and hope ur relationship works out!
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_20> rule of thumb - boys are stupid.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> (yes, this is a trick question).
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> now and been married for 3 yrs.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> guys love it when u make the 1st move
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_50> the first group works hard on the inner self
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> look bit--ches not all men arent honest like ho es are so i dunno y yall automatically think that
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> (Even if she's not dating/married, if she's with someone attached, that makes her a cheat too!)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> stupid, trying to buy there love, foolish, easy, don't try it
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> I guess its the law of nature.. whoever you like the most never cares about you.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> I met this guy on the internet and like him very much.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> I have never asked out a guy but thats what I hear alot
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> If a girl gets too possessive, the guy will not like it.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> Find someone else (who isnt a jerk)
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> Find a different guy you like that likes you too.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> Man this i a tough one!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> one question, did u tell your friend that u like that guy?if no, sorry, you're too late.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> He just didnt want children and I have 2.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> You just need to see them.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> If others have a problem with it too bad.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> i don't think that he have the same feeling!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Ok, I some profiles up on dating sites.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> it would probably makes u feel real good.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> I cant help but wonder...who did he kiss at midnight?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> :)       and one more thing.... if you run into him regularly...always look your best just for a cheap thrill!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_20> Quizilla.com is a pretty good place to go for fun surveys!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Wish you a very happy married life in advance
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> after all he thinks your really special so he can't be too stupid.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_25> and I u r sick of her then get back at me!!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> Hey boys just wondering what you like so i can show my boyfriend *hehehe*
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> ah, i dont know give me some advice guys.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> Nice guys talk about feelings when she doesn't want to.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> But I would not advice going down that same hard road.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> IF YOU REALLY LIKE THIS ONE THAN GO FOR IT .
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> My favorite...  Can I buy you a drink or do you just want the money?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> when you start seriosuly looking for one
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> try to become friends and speak up.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> seeing as you say youre in prison, im not gonna give you my return address.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> think positively... he might want to buy you a new swimsuit
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> apparently, he's perfect but he likes football.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> There is nothing I would change about my wedding day!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> does your crush and his crew mind you hanging out with them?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> its about $350, is that too much to spend on a man?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> If a guy ends up going out with me, he better be prepared to share the d*mn bill!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> just make sure things dont get to serious because you have plenty of time for guys.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> i brought my dog there, and she had hers.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> If you wanna stay and fix what every problems, then do.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> u no  u gotta hav it in da summa its warm great and flowers r in business!

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> I hardly even notice hair colour...

<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> get a book on marriage and how to make it work and leave it somewhere obvious.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Ok, so he is calling her every day right?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> DO U KNOW WHERE SHE GOT MARRIED.ITS A LEAGAL DOCUMENT AND IS OPEN 2 PUBLIC.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> After the family reunion......I asked him if he could take me home.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> so you should just ask him what he thinks about relationships in general.

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> CLUB Most Popular in your city/area ;))
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> I'd forgive that person(if I really LOVE her/him)
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> and now dont have the urge.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> YES YES YES YES IT IS SIN UNLESS YOU MARRIED!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> My youngest doesn't want me to even think about dating someone unless it is her.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> I thought it was one kid but I asked him and it wasn't him.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> i feel it is not bad.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> does he be with you a lot especially when you need him?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> BUT.... do NOT stay out of pity!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> Better yet - why don't you sleep with her future husband!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> but like i said it all depends on the couple.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> it depends on the vibe of the date, i think
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I don't see where you would have time for more than one.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Alot of guys start rumors to build up their ego's.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> if you have a good man or woman in your life you should be happy.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> I HAVE BEEN WANTING TO TELL YOU........
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_15> DON'T LET HIM FOOL YOU OR LIE TO YOU.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Just be happy for her..  :)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> He said........I have a great surprise for you!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> Men react as if, You GO girl!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> It's just coming out that way.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> When you'd really do anything for them not just have feelings (because feeling don't always last)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> -how do i get somebody that will marry me: find them and propose, duh!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> lol, it would be kinda silly to be looking at them and kissing them...think about it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> or if that doesn't work, you need an outsider help, like viagra...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> am i not supposed to breathe?i'm neither single nor dating.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_15> NOT ALL OF THEM BUT SOME OF THEM.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> if you smile him, he smiles back to you.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> It might mean that your probably gonna have to make the first move.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> i have a very nice gf!
<NbChars_490> <LevSim_15> Same reason Nice Guys finish last.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> So, I don't think generalization like that is good...
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_25> We are sooooooo glad to finally meet you!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> if you are good friends than you can hadnle it.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> I'm so confussed becuz I'm still in luv with him.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> ALL ITS SAYING IS THERE SOMEONE IN YOUR LIFE THAT IS TRYING TO FORCE THERE WILL ONTO YOU.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> TO ENJOY EVERY DAY WITH A PERSON YOU CAN TRUST AND CONFIDE IN THEM YOUR MOST INNER FEELINGS.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> If ur not ready, dont plunge in.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> she still got him before u you know.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> Well realistically...I know I am though :)
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> She likes somebody else right now, but it's not really serious.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> not unless your doing something inappropriate
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> *  My advice is to stop.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> no, and i would never do that, unless he was like 2 or 1 year older.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> think about how your heart feels then you'll know what to do.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> It depends on the guy, and the girl, and what each of them is looking for (one night?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> you only like to have sex from both, believe me !!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it is after all a million bucks.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> sence Christians already gave thier life to Jesus its no long your choice to act on now is it??
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> It depends on the guy, and the girl, and what each of them is looking for (one night?

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> Sexually, you probably can't beat it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> If she is 18 all bet s are off and she can have who ever she wants
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> I don't want to loose or screw up the friendship we have.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> IT IS TO ENJOY LIFE WITH THE ONE YOU MOST LOVE.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> don't be a creepy stalker either.

<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> and then you see them still looking and flirting and talking to other women.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> you only get to be a weirdo when you feel like one.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> do what all the women have done to me.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> well, if there's a connection and i'm really into him, 1 date.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Remember where you heard it first!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> What a moron, how desperate can you be?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> Uh....well....I have not had sex as a married man.

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> I don't know and i don't get it either.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Go beat your head on a wall until you forget that crap.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> and most of us fake it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> I take a Tylenol before sex and it helps me alot!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Hello .. ( I am told only ) Levitra is better then viagra !!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> i look over at him and he turns to loose eye contact.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> BELIVE ME HE DOES NOT CHOOSE TO BE THIS WAY.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> i understand(ps.don't tell ur age online!)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> I'll slap her and give her half the money!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> No, it wont make it stronger, but you wont be best friends forever either, so go ahead
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> But they should notice you anyway I guess
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> do not let that stop you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> So go do the right thing!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> i have to ask u this, does he really loved u?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> what kind of guy you looking for?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> NOW, Why is she the best woman I ever met??
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> WHEN YOU CAN' STAND TO BE AWAY FROM THEM FOR ONE MINUTE.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> (maybe not that extreme,but...) You have to tell her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> think about that, just in case.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> yes, you should be able to
<NbChars_300> <LevSim_25> It's funny now, but it wasn't then!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> he cheats and he's still happily married.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> if you love each other, then you can still save your relationship.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> should i go 4 it, or walk away
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> because good guys get stuck in the LJBF zone...and now they are the shoulder to cry on
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> In other words......when In love...I share.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> dude if you dont know what a G-SPOT is than you got a problem.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no, i wont hurt my mom juz bcos of damn money
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> if u mean 'it' as 'sex' then no i have not.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> The whole thing is complicated, but worth it if he IS everything
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Tell him just what kind of a hoe she really is.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> And then we had a coke and ate pizza.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> or have you tried a wingman?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> It sounds so much like me...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> well i wouldn't put up with that.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> Dont need to talk but if hes watchin TV go watch tv with him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Actually yeah I do kind a&#92;have advice.. Is it possibly your kind of shy?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Guys do not touch things that they don't like.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> If he were in love with you he would have spent New Years eve with you...and only you.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> i would have to say no.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> coz every boy gets tempt by different things.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> the question u ask depend on ur answer guys be straight forward ok
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> I just totally like asked him and he was like.. no way she is gross.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_50> no im 21 and engaged to a 22 year old.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> If she shows up at your house, tell her, Sorry, but we were just leaving.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> imagine the boobs when the woman is in her seventies.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> go party and like show him that you r having fun without him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> is it OK with you if you don't know whom is your father?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> MAYBE HE THINKS HE'S DOING GREAT IN BED WHILE U R SAYING HE'S NOT.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> *Maybe you should look for characteristics other than a persons appearance!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> if not then talk it up
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Probably never kissed a girl before.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Third, maybe she is giving you a straight answer, and it's just not the one you want.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> if you want to hang around for months on end, then at least do something constructive.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> if u have anymore quiries ask me
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> And no you are not devious!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> not enough.....once a week at most
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> The problem is not on how u tell it...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> of course you should e-mail him .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> mumbling on and on about how her love had broke her heart.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> if u r a girl then forget it i am a boy
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> walking away seems like the easiest way out sometimes.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Women are greedy, give them the both, and they will say,  It isnot working good enough, honey
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> i find good old friends comforting!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> My man thinks that guys always like me even though i never see any clues that they might.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> it is better u find out
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> if u love her, stay with her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Me, i like there to be hair down there.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> (Not all women are like this .
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_25> Good luck & keep the faith!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Of course girls always like to win.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> THATS HOW IT STARTS OFF THEN THEY START MEETING EACH OTHER AND ONE THING LEADS TO ANOTHER.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> OR you could hand him a bag of serial killer movies, especially on valentines day!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> althought once i met a lady in a park.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> its natural, because he is a movie star.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> i got really good answers this one person told me to go talk to him .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> theres nothing wrong with that if you cant get it the real way.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> that would make life too easy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> But that doesn't mean it wouldn't be good enough to have a working relationship.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> And great ideas on fun ways to make the alubm ( scrapbook)
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> It just depends--i just prefer to nto have contact with them at all.....but thats just me
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> u got 2 put down your cards on the table.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> don't look for it, it will find you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> this really hurts when it happens.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> if u love someone than u have to let them go.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> but dat messed wit my feelins
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> what am i supposed to do?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> I can't say, I don't know any but my own.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> Like everyone else I think it's no excuse.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Yea I know Cindy,it's tough isn't?.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> None of that stupid tell him in a note crap.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> I like the junk in the trunk, so with your two choices I would pick B.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> i like most guy who has a little belly,, u know why?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> scream her sister's name in bed......and don't apologize.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> thanks for posting your comment to my question  I hope this helps any
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> if you dont like it he should respect that and leave it alone!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> after you are friends then you can start to flirt with him and move towards him.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> well, dont u have it tough?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> and most importantly does he answer the same way about you, i sure hope so for your sake.
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_20> I think the average is:  Guys 16/17 Girls 14/15
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> make sure he isnt using you for sex only  make him wait.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> just have fun with it and only take it for what its worth.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> and drive off to her new life, married to another man.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> yes you will,  just be patient and confident
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> i have had dreams like that.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> if he tells them he is involved with you, keep him, if he plays them on, dump him
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> all you can do is think about them.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> I am sorry but size does count...my ideal penis size should be no smaller than 6
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> No you are not  GO FOR IT!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> And if ur scared, girl...ask urself who did it to u before.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> It's like the Trill of the chase.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Do you have any idea what you would have to go through?)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> Goth chicks, stoners, geeks, band campers, everyone.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> If your a guy don't get somone your friends like get someone YOU like.

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> not all asian women give into white guys.

<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> WOULD LIKE TO BE THE SUGAR DADDY FOR A YOUNG LADY BETWEEN AGES OF 18 & 30.

<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> i don't think it's ok putting up with hings like that.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Wait hold up i thaught the guy was supppose to b asking that question!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> So mix it up a little.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> ur fiteen that is the age where you most start to get intense sexual feelings and orgasms.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> Hot girls have low self-esteem .
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> if it makes him happy that you just be yourself, will you do that?.......
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> NOW I DONT KNOW HOW TO PUT MYSELF OUT THERE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> If I see a girl that I think is hot, would I jump in bed with her?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> you should talk to her and let her no how you feel about this guy (you like).
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> Just be nice to her now, and then when she is single again, be brave and ask her out.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> If he says no, then go out and find the one that you were meant to marry.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> try the product if it is good you did a good job
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> You know what they say ...
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> Do not play games, just be straight up.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> im 26, would it be okay?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Of course, but I ain't easy...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> don't feel bad happen to me before.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> do you ever come to arkansas and do you have a pic??
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> without a gf you have no chance.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Yeah she should kick you out, if you need a place to stay call Boys town National Hotline...Bad boy
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> the perfect a girl in mexico.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> That's not just bad, that's atrocious.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> Do what he likes, be who he likes and he will notice how much you care.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> When you are in love, you know it.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_45> show her man is the boss in the house but willing to share decsion before taking it?
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> Its not because guys don't care, it's because women want more.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> it didnt work before y chew you cabbage twice???
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Send me a line on messenger if you like.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Either stick with him or don't, that's up to you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> Everybody does do it but I guess its just women being women.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> So don't give up , get out there and have some fun.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Do ya think she just wants attention.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> if you dont love your signaficant other dont cheat just get a divorce.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> does this make me look fat.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> And God will forgive you if you make a mistake!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Don't worry about them laughing at you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> y would you want a woman to pay for dates?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> As far as your love life now,keep looking,the right one is out there, but be careful!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> if she is a bad lady then just dont talk to her stay away from her
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> I can look at girls n think that they are really pretty.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> is just important as the time you give to them.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Plan something simple but fun incase she says,'Doing what.?'
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> it means this is how is it and this is how it's going to be.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> some people find it very nice others dont want to try it again.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> when u can't take it anymore thats when enough is enough
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> we met on line and he had apic on the site and i didn't have any made.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> what do u think i should wear?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> dont wait... just surprise him and do it first !
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> So I guess that's pretty much just us.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> When someone found out about it, they were like isn't that a little too soon?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but of course, not all men.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Do what will make you happy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Some women’s like it some don't.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> how do you know they are the one you need to be with.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Some women have very sensitive nipples and some don't.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> Does he kiss better than your sister?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> but if he goes out on dates with girls, that is a different matter.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> if you like it you are gay
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Guys can get the picture on this.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> the thing is how do you stay in love?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> yea, it's true sometimes u lose something in love.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> prostitutes, man i telling you that is the way to go
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> just be careful on what signals that u send one another.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Ask her why an attractive girl like her is dining alone...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If no, then try asking him why.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> should i dump them from bein my friends, or not?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Whatever you do, don't worry about being different: this gives you an edge on the other guys.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> don't think about the motions involved, just try to make your partner horny.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Do it.........and then let us know how it goes.....k?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> IT IS WRONG TO SEE YOUR FRIEND'S BOYFRIEND THAT WAY.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> :)He said it back that made me very happy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Once a cheater ALWAYS a cheater.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> U could give her 6 red and 6 white...be different!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> it was my first time... i dont know how many tomes he has tried it already...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> when ur life flashes before ur eyes and hes not in it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Guy or girl, that's being a friend.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> If you think he's interesting say so, if you think he's funny, tell him you crack me up!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Please send me the video..thanks....send it to:  234 yankers way JO,.Oklahomo 23456
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Best bet.....Ask him....if to shy to ask.... have someone else ask for you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> start by telling them about you
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> -try getting her something that she'll like, dont getting something to personal though.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> I Love You) Little things like that help.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> Funny and fun to be with.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> age doesnt matter younger or older do u think he acts immature?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Does he still want me physically or is he just trying to be nice?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> but i stoped liking him cuz i didnt want to hurt our relationship.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> i say theres way more guys out there!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> jumped neacked infront of him and  when he is alone that always gets my attention
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> THe only thing is I kind of think he is using me.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> I think I might be gay so we can kinda be friends
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> JUST TELL HIM YOU LIKE HIM!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> I dont know why .. lol  i have to pee too ( i am a guy :P )
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> (I was able to realise she was not at all my type)
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> Thats like saying, do women cheat always?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> You have a chance to, but don't turn a girl down because she's ugly or something stupid.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> do you even feel bad about what you did??
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> Im assuming that your not talking about someone that you just met.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> then after all the love you have givin that person they just want something new.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> communication is the first step...without it you wouldn't know how to make him happy...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> im going to be a jerk and say, no
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> out of sight, out of mind.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> look a real man..wouldnt accept a dare like that.. because he wouldn't want to test losing you..
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> My question is to all GIRLS out there is what you actually seek in you BF.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> why is sad all the time when all it does it hert people
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> if you don't want to hurt her then do it as quickly as possible.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> MOST PROBABLY HIS MOTHER IF THEY ARE THAT CLOSE AND HES SCARED OF HER.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> (i am sure that theirare things that you boyfriend wants to do in his fanstasies)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> and me and him are really close friends now.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> But yea, after that, touching his penis is always an effective start
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Obviously if he cared he would have called back.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> I don't mean to sound like and ass.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> no not all men cheat, you just seem to find the wrong guy
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> So they won't be called whores.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> WELL IF YOU AGREE TO TRUST AND BE APART OF THEE PERSON YOU WANNA STAY WITH THEN WHY NOT!!!!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> Obviously if he cared he would have called back.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> I don't mean to sound like and ass.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> no not all men cheat, you just seem to find the wrong guy
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> So they won't be called whores.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> WELL IF YOU AGREE TO TRUST AND BE APART OF THEE PERSON YOU WANNA STAY WITH THEN WHY NOT!!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> discuss only your baby with him.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> No offense, but it sounds like one of the biggest mistakes you could ever make.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> (if you dont know what im talking about, 1st base = kissing, hand holding, hug, what is it?)
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> hi who r u first of all.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Once a cheater always a cheater.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> Cold turkey honey, like heroin or cigarettes.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> Barrow some money, I'm broke as hell right now!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> its not an ogasm , i read an article once, where women mistake they're orgasm with some bladder problem..
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> because you cant get a gf.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> its cause men and women minds are wired different.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> only a bad person would do this.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> If you don't do any better...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> i have new friends now and iam happier than i was when there was so much gossip.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> Sure why not either way your gonna cause a mess.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> kiss them and give them a big hug and say I love you  that should do it...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> And if your parents object, tell them you really need to do this, I hope they'll understand :)
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> Please, please, PLEASE do not throw your life away
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> Well if you really have love for that one girl then you should put yourself out there.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> but u won't like the ans.lol cuse thay are as veryed as breast size.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> clit and penis that can be connected together
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> them saying you are gay sounds like sour grapes to me.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> your going to have a lot disagreements.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> don't know if i should give him other chance.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> How about hi, my name is... And quit using this sight to help you get laid, that's just sad.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> or is there another reason behind it?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> yes there are its just hard to find them
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> well... it matters if you just how you think about it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> wow at least you know its not real normal.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> do you go with who you want or whats right and how do you know the difference?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> ID... check out my blog... ykalex let me know what u think.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> It's your life too...Don't waste your time waiting..ask him!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> One of my good friends found a really nice guy and they have been together for 5 years!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> don't call yourself  ' black ' .
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> Naked women & men, doing sexual things.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> if she flirts or says hi like alot of times then hey!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> Else, don't hang out with her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> But don't just end it without warning.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> take it slow whats ur rush?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_10> TULIPS, LILIES, DRAGON SNAPPS, THATS ALL I CAN THINK OF
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Like a playstation,  or maybe some music.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> so i was going to dump him but he dumped me first.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> i think he liked it and i was pretty proud of myself for being so bold.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> men need to be given something to persue.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> Well, I don't really loose the mood, you probably do b/c you're thinking about it.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> Get naked and go down on him.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> do you wait to see if he says it first?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> If you are not happy - get a divorce, then have sex!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> Get a real man, just don't deny him his kid.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> i left college in january and also left my boyfriend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> you might need some help of family adviser
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> why are all the good ones either married or gay?
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_25> sexy is a very relative term....
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> If so, u can get lot of BF under 21 in que, waiting for u.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> And if all else fails, its just one more year, babe!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> at least you get to see him everyday!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> What I want to know from girls is...why do you all think you're fat??!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> then enjoy the quiet cruise back to the dock.. and then it is up to you wink wink...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> before i answer, is he a rich dealer??
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Or just try the Secret Admirer ploy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Chances are, he likes you too!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> u can tell wen someone either likes u or is cheatin on u!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> and if u want, u may contact a psychiatrist
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> IF YOU LOOKIN FOR A FRIEND THATS OKAY BUT UNDER THEN THAT YOU IN THE WRONG SITE
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> so they just become big jerks.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> My ex-wife cheated on me and I gave her a second chance.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> this is brittany by the way
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> 3 years later, we got married.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> well,if women can get silicon breasts,i think u could get a silicon member
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> and well me and my mate are lookin for some fittys
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> multiply urself into two... that may help...
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> there is no good or bad in general.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> go into his face say i like you
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_20> Will you go to hell for remarrying?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> multiply urself into two... that may help...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> there is no good or bad in general.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> go into his face say i like you
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> Will you go to hell for remarrying?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> in hard situations which u feel ur self have the ability to do something better than her
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Eyes Closed Eyes Open Hard Kisser Public kisser Tongue kisser Everybody kisser
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> u can acquire it by practice
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> pretend u r playing your boyf with a boy who is your friend
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> I DON'T SHARE MY MAN WITH ANYONE.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Well, first, girls dont normally ask guys to dance.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> Then move up to the big stuff.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> spend time not just sucking them like a crazed animal but caressing them and the like.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_20> Start farting around him....and stop shaving
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> I guess women just don't talk about things like that.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> see i am in love with my boyfriend and he has been acting funny the past couple days.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> Just be happy how it is.. im a female by the way.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> wow, i went through this myself.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> CHEATING REQUIRES PHYSICAL CONTACT IF HE'S JUST CAMMIN, IT'S SELF GRATIFICATION .
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> if your in2 som1 and theerre in2 u then yes
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Some girls think they're fat because other people have the audacity to tell them that.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> if a girl said it say are you sure because we can talk about it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> To be my height(5'9) and weight(185)I really don't think i'm fat i thick!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> what is it about married men that ladies cant semto resist
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> Having a guy go hot and cold on you is no fun.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> Who wants date with him,you or your sister
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> You should dump him or cheat on and lie to him!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> This is not true, nowadays girls are doing this to men.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> It depends on how much she loves him
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Ask if he has a girlfriend.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Just the first thing that came to mind.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> u must not be ready sweetie.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> I think its not even possible
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> just imagine how much worse their life would be, if it was behind bars.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> my neighbour,Josh is like 999yrs old.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> yes you should ask him it is 2006 just ask shorty one love rio
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> i think i should be any one girlfreind i just asking because my boyfriend is black and hot
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> FIrst, stop sleeping with the guy.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Do u really wanna ruin ur life so soon?????????
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> when he changes his surname to bundy....and visits chainsaw selling shops...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> then u should go, unless there is changes.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> DO IT, even if you are sick, and able to move.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> i f he cant give you competent answers dont even waist your time, keep it pushing.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> Please just forget about this guy.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> Um yea have you ever in your life even heard the word sex????????
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> A lot of girls like white roses - makes it a little different from the usual red roses.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> Now ask your self, Am I?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Should I just flat out aks her if she thinks we could start dating again??
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> He or she hates it when you act happy like it ain't no big deal!
<NbChars_25> <LevSim_10> girl he is sssssssssssssssssooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo fine gurL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> I'm kinda having the same problem.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> Don't mess with a good thing.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> it was really hard for me to break up with my boyfriend but he accpeted it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> show him that your a strong enough person that you don't need his attention.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> And you don't do it in public.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Someone told him negative things about u.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> But don't lose hope.......you get 9 tries at this.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> I did that for my mom 50th b-day.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Then if she is interested go solo on occasion.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> dont try and talk about something' whats with girls today?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> I'll leave him if you want to get married and he don't there some sexy men out there
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Once, then it could have been a mistake.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> If you don't know what you're doing it is.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> because ur not looking in the right places....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> and nothing ever happend with us or between them!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> But hey don't let that stuff get you down because theres a girl out there that you'll find....
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> But cheating isnt the way to go.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> thats how i feel and he does too.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> No, Josh thinks girls have cooties so he won't kiss you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> it depends on how long you want to wait, or waste your time.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> then tell those other people theyre gay and that u love him
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> You go girl... Let me hear you ROAR!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> i have been participating in cultural interaction and now i want it in my marriage.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> na it isnt bad when i was 13 i was doin the damn thing
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> Should I tell her next time she asks or just keep dodging her?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Take ur time don't whore yourself into anything
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Im there for evrything he will tell me everything no matter what.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> Tell him and then have sex with her.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> u haf...it's jus that u nv realise...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> Why Do Men Or Guys Always Want Sex 24/7 ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> but very well adapted to excersise and dream up ways to keep going also.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Don't worry, just take it easy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> would you straight up tell her that you like the appearence of another female?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Girls like guys who are bad or a challenge.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> You are confident enough to ask strangers for advice, it shouldn't be a problem...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> grow up and maybe at a later date, he MIGHT notice you again
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> friends you have for a life time.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> When I did, he wanted me to sit on his lap...
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> hey bro if it didnt meen nothing then when ever the time comes.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Some girls really like shy guys, or the strong silent type.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> Some women like big, burly guys, while others like 'em long & lean.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> If he totally hates me, then how do I deal?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> no way, trust is all you have
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> but if the reason you dont have sex is her illness, that would be bad
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> Sorry honey, but that IS life!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> Like I said I would need more info.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> Not a boy who wets his bed.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> I dont think it makes you lesbian.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> No I dont think it is.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> makes it a little more comfortable and go from there
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> body sprays you can use thru out the day.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> yes, age has nothing to do with love, and 37 is not old
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> the only thing i can tell you is to persevere and you will get there
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> if hes your first bf, accept the fact that you will make mistakes and he probably will too.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> sory dude couldnt b bothered to read the riting
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> boys that is intelligant and loving
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> cuz im not jealous and I dont get all weird.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Hope you found someone to replace her with thats not so boring!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> I mean seems like you got a lil' money.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> look at me and you will tell im the best...jk They will come to you..just dont worry
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_20> if he's legal and willing; go for it girl!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> come on perv get an life
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> HE IS WHAT ARE YOU BLIND.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> My life after about 12 and on has been pretty good.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> you also have to let your wants be known
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> cuz its like e-mails and such only with messages and comments
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> just do it and tell him to smell your fingers and guess what it is!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> I wouldn't take him back there would be a huge trust issue!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> I have told guys that I wanted to kiss him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> there are gurlie's like that too i know life's tough
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> or better yet: why don`t U kiss him!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> when the drugs are gone, obviously... time to find some other poor sucker you can mooch off of...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i don't know what to do.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> maybe you're just really hot and he cant keep his hands off you
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> probably he likes you or hes crazy
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> There are guys out there who are waiting...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> if u love ur friend, u should talk to her.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> have u got a phone book
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> OH YEAH YOU SHOULD BE WORRIED.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> ^_^ i also agree w/ dede!!!!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> no who is he cheating with yahoo or googles
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> i was happy and wanted more but its your opinon
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> or she could be doing it for attention
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> haha no um are you sure u don't know...look it up
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> plaese help me :(     so whos wrong?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> no who is he cheating with yahoo or googles
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> i was happy and wanted more but its your opinon
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> or she could be doing it for attention
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> haha no um are you sure u don't know...look it up
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> I mean, it's just something that you made yourself believe in and now your mind reacts like that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> a lover scorned is like no other hell.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> THAT kind of freaky is just....wrong!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> People can't sugar coat things all the time ya know.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> depends on the age group actually!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> why wait till 5, you got a kid, and that's the prodding he should really need.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> tell him that you love women..
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> In relationship, showing how much they like a female?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> The most important advice I ever got about marriage was that you should always make love!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> if you have sex with another person, then no.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> -- i am really sorry my answer is so long, but i hope it helps - - -
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> I keep telling you guys that Johnny Depp wants me.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> dont worry about it a wife will always disagree
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> lol no way should you do something like that.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> after youre married read the bible but if not then hotel room is nice
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> what happened next?what did your partner say or do?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> always keep in touch...then once in while both of you must go out...:)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> Good Luck, make it work a good man is worth keeping, they are so hard to find.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> But you only need one month hehe!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> yo mamma prefers me and i have long hair
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> or is it that you just treated her like shit???
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Some guys still think they can date young woman.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> i want it to be perfect the first time.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Is he going to marry her???
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> it's something i will never do again and i don't think you should ever do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> Guys are always thinking about sex.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_35> to me this sounds like the saddest thing ever.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> And watch how she interacts with other people too!~
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> HE'S NOT READY TO BE IN A GOOD RELATIONSHIP.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> as long as u dont look like burt from sesame str.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> what is seriously wrong with guys?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> nope you can still be friends if you two still get along.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_30> i've had 3 relationships at work and i think it is up to the couple.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> 1 would you rather go out with him and have your friend feel hurt?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> thats cos your a sad loser and should find a woman for real not online!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> it's already been answered so many times...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> THIS MEANZ THE 19 THE AGE..WHEN U ENTER IN LOVE ....THIS IS THE STARTING AGE OF LOVE =))

<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> u can try sideways and see if it's best ;)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Who are these losers to tell you who you can and can't be friends with?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Don't go hooking up with just anyone beacuse your not with him, you have a baby now.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> coz we're scared of embarrassing ourselves....
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Also one day they are with you then the next they are with your best friend?!?
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> It just might do her some good!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> its about where does he come back.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> Best not to go on record at all.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_40> try to see the 'guy' in the girl.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Im pretty sure he has feelings for you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> i think askin her this question will clear up everythin ..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> It's simple really...we don't like saggy, droopy, wrinkly, dried-up haggy-baggies!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Tell him there are guys who are MARRIED that have'nt had ANY SINCE AUGUST   BASICALLY TWICE A YEAR!!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> no because you'll burn in hell
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> **If U can, PLS READ my other Questions
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Guys always want what they can't have.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> When you meet that special one..you're gonna know it and he will too!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> so call down and go for it!
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_45> one question why ya broke up
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> hi im bi to but mostly go out with guys email me sometime
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> i got divorced in nov05 after 5 years.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> get the markers out and draw on eachothers arms and stuff like fake tattooes lol
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> niether...if you have to ask a bunch of people who u dont know then niether
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> YES BUT ALOS HAVE TO HAVE IT IN YOUR SOUL
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> I'm assuming ur a girl because of ur picture.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> when your only 13 but hopefully that helps.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> so u have still the chance to find someone.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> There will always be cuter guys that the one your with.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_40> At night school while earning your GED.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> I think we are all ok though.....as of today no men have had a baby
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> do you wanna keep your bestfriend or bang this chick?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> there are a lot of independent moms out there.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> Talk to him and quit being a pussy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Yo this is princess the finest chick in trenton!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> coz Asian women have small vagina!!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> tell her she is screwin up.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> i know that most people are scared of finding that true love, and what finding that person means.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> I think about how amazing that would be.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> for your case i think that its probably just a crush.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> ask her out and by a ring
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> this would lead me to belive that he either has a girl or he doesnt like you back.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> just try not to orgazim so quickly just smooth and sensshual
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> Why else girl keep asking .
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> and who knows maybe she's thinking the same thing an is having the same problem.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> So in theory you need to remarry so you can ...live with someone .... have sex with someone...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> or she just is not willing to control her usage of words n sentences.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> i dont like superstars, so i wont marry one..
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Just tell him that you thought it would be cool to go with him.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> 27 is the best for me...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> it will pay off in the long run.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> What if the department head needs security for something????
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> My husband is Jewish and I am not!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Ask your self why you always take her back?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> i think it might help you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> ask yourself do you like her or her body?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If not, then you should break up.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> For a more traditional meal I have one:  1.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> i am agree with good answer of yoyohill.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Youve dated some bad bad seeds.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> i hardly everrr see him in school either usually i see hima t my brothers basketball games .
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> don't be to nervous just be your self and you'll do just fine.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> if a guy said it leave him alone.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> Dont go out with him .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> FIRST A LITTLE ADVICE: LOVE UrSELF, U CAN'T LOVE SOMEONE ELSE IF U DON'T LOVE UrSELF.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> But until then, do not sleep with him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> Most of all, listen to your Mom.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> because that is your main focus.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> ofcourse u still have fellings for her u just broke up donw worrie they will go back to normal
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> ASK him whats up in a joking kind of way.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> total submissive  to your boy friend so you can win his heart
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> don't you look at handsome men when you are with him?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> and fast.. hes not worth it, since you arent together anymore.. you hate him, now stop thinking about him
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> advice don't tell your friends your business.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> wut do u think is an appropiate age to lose ur virginity..w/out it being too young?.......
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> You will NEVER get away from her.. she is his/her mother!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> Just forget all he has done.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> 20 women stores and accessories, etc...1 or 2 guy stores.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> - then she's just naive and it's just a crush.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> it also means that u might be with that person for a very long time?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Maybe go get coffee and then take a walk afterwards.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> hey kelsie yeah thanks for the answer, i think i'll do that.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> at least be honest with her.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> meet after dinner time at clubs with no cover.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> you are tlaking to the wrong guys
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> LOL.... well, i dont like it... but one of my friends loves it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> If he is still in training, WAIT UNTIL HE GRADUATES!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> if ur thinking about the person day/night and if u bug(like seeing) them too much.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> you just have to find a good girl
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> get as fat as you can so he cant see beyond your fat body.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> They get too groos in there.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> or they can be a famous star.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> I DO NOT THINK YOU KNOW WHAT LOVE IS.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> well those people arnt just guys!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> well its depend on situation,but girls don't break heart if he is rite.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> well i say that if he is cute go wit him girl try somethin new its that easy
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> dont know but when you find out let me know.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> If you break up with someone and think about them still six months later?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Find someone your own age...don't you think?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> I hope you get what i mean.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> But if you want that to change just be a little ubersexual
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Doing it now will help both of you heal and move on.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> I feel like she's trying to take my man.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> IF YOU WANT TO MAKE HER FEEL GOOD, HELP HER GET BACK ON HER FEET.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> I do laundry I do dishes I vaccumm.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> honestly you have to go by his actions.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Now My old best friend is occusing the girl of sleeping with her ex.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> like get 2 kno him & try 2 find out some things in common
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> I stink, help me to not stink.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> talk to him about his jealousy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Don't believe this guy for an instant.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Just leave a message asking him to get back to you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> your kids will know that mamma isn't happy and that'll make them unhappy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> How do i convince him we're not gonna be together anymore?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> the right one will come when you're not looking so hard!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> he will obey(cherish) you if he really love you
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> whats in it for men, nothing!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> It's to bad that they are raisedlike this.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> first how long you been going out???
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> do you think the relationship is worth one more try?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Otherwise, he might be hurt if u don't go with him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> And if he does should I say anything to him?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> its do they tell the true do they lie to you
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> About the kiss thing I really don't know that is something a girl could say first!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Then the baby is ready to come out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> hey don't give up hope though u'll find her one day!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Just be yourself and don't try to impress them.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> She is just a selfish girl.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> but i really wanna know why she's still part of me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> You should not do this in front of her!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> So I hope my advice helps.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> Move on, they are not worth it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> because its no ones business but their own!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> While u still have bus fare.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> You should pick up a sack, some Phillies, and have some fun.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> You have the audacity to ask should you stay or go...you cheated on him!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> one that is the opposite of my ex.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> No No No .... Love is all around us.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> and would you mind having a threesome you your boyfriend and me
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> no your stupid you think republicans are better they SUCK!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_25> But yeah dude that was dirty getting her kids took.
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_20> and I touch um every chance I get.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> And at a very unusual time in my life too.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> !that will always cheer you up...
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> there isn't a too long, u just have to do it when u feel ur ready
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Have sex with her and ask how she feels.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Guys buy us stuff and it is so great to be pretty.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> there are so many out there.. Good luck with your search!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> my wife is no loner interested
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Women don't like liars, they like politicans.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> but i found out he was cheating on me and I knew it had to stop.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Best birthday present would be her with nothing on but a bow...   ;)
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_35> o so ur family is w/ a maniac.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> So find someone that will return your love!!!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i have seen the love of my life.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> You don't have to call and go off.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> If he did he'd have called.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> But if you mean just sex then I guess appearance.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> He is my bestfriend I love him!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You don't have to call and go off.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> It's nothing but boring old vanilla ice cream for you baby.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> If he did he'd have called.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> But if you mean just sex then I guess appearance.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> He is my bestfriend I love him!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> you owe it to him and you owe it to yourself as well.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> either that or they're just too smart to deal with the drama!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> no it doesnt mean that ur bi.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> we dont need anymore young parents around here, we got enough of um.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> We have a baby boy together.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> How can I get her back?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Think to your self is this fun thing worth loosing the one you love?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> keep ua man on the run by being attractive.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> they have to be on this website.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> little sex often leads to cheating.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> These are not things that should be just turned on and off IMO.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> If yes then You are :) that's waht i would say.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> ask him quizes about his fommer gf
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> If you just send him an email, then that means ur scared.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Why not just ask him if he would be interested in having lunch with you.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> That's my advice to you, Good Luck!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> u cant be sure unless you ask but look 4 all of then signs
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> And, at 13, sex isn't that great anyway.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> i spoke to the mum a few days ago and that's when she told me all that stuff.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> he dosen't deserve you find someone who does.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> no i wouldnt say to do that.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> the book of techniques in bed to make both of you feel very good
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> Nonchalantly just ask her, hey you want to hang out this weekend?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Did I ruin things by sleeping w/ him too soon?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> if you consider masturbating cheating, then yes.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> ;-) Can't wait for the summer...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> do you see him very often
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> and soft kisses on the back works too.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> Go with the one whom you love provided 'the one'(u havent mentioned wether it's a she/he) loves u too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Im not sure what to do   SHould I tell him ?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> search kama sutra on google ....
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> He's a great guy and Im sure that theres more out there somewhere.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Long....long hair is so sexy when it's got the right style.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> At least he didn't beat you like mine did.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> u might feel queesy and tingly..tat's how i felt
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Because the gov is srewed up.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> 1st, you talked all about you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Unless you hang out all the time and are best buds, then she might love you...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> In other words Boys ask girls out not the other way around.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> sometimes its better to just be friends
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> I lost my virginity at 17 and then it opened the flood gates...hahhahaha.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_15> SEX AND MORE SEX AND MORE SEX AND MORE SEX.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> hey girl i think your nice would yu pls email me juanchubaca7@yahoo.com
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> you can not make them not cheat.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> If you are scared....you are not supposed to be having it!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> Some guys are just weird and confusing cause they choose to be
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> kids,computer,playstation and tv comes first,whats left I get
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> What you see is what you get.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> if you are into pain...go for it!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> First...a boy is not a guy and a guy is not a man.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> young men are looking around...and women are just mirrors.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> don't let this guy use you again avoid him at all cost and forget about him!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I need to write a good Best man speach.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Ahhhh, I'm a parent.....what don't I feel guilty about??
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> If you're not, and you love her, then you should just let her go.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> get your mom some bubble bath!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Way to go, now you just need to stick wth it .
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> I'm gonna try my own advice.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> ?.....unaware that you feel the way you do.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Get out there and hang out, listen to conversations, watch people interact.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> either he likes u or ure fat,ugly,or mean
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> It all depends on the season of the wedding  : )   Good luck
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> again be late so she already has a drink.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> but u'll find true love for sure.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> its entirely possible that he is too shy to tell you.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> Integrity should be screaming at you at this stage.... DON'T DO IT!!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> Then you would end up making things look even worse!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> women talk in code and men talk in direct language
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> remember there are people out there who are single and doing all in their power to look attractive.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> good luck and make sure you don't choose a club with knots
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> HE IS USING YOU BUT YOU HAVE TO STOP IT TELL HIM AND JUST DON'T MAKE YOURSELF TOO AVAILABLE.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> so no doubt we cant forget them at all.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> THis isnt a answer but thanks for the tip on my question!!!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> dont do this never think about this give real love to your wife .
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> but we went out for a while before i loved him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> Good Luck, and remeber what I said, shur, he's your first but Not your last!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> you only want to last long with sex no wonder he/she don't want you anymore!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> longer man not too long, shaggy like oooo somethin to run my fingers through
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> When you least expect it...relax and have fun!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> Someone out there who will understand your pain and say OK, do it..
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> You just have to ask him!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> if you really love this guy you are just going to have to put up with it.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> he raelly likes you or he just wants to get some
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> The worst that can happen is he'll say no...and he just might surprise you!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Talk about n e thin u like, as long as it has nuthin 2 do with his ex girlfriends.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> You should ask him out on a date!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> giving my life to jesus christ, and speaking in toungues for the first time
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Okay, so I like this guy, like, a lot.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> how can i make friends with a person that i had a relationship with ?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Dont look at it as in what you lost, but what you have to gain!!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> just dont bother them remeber all important dates
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> 1. if she likes to be with you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> well if your cousin is romantically interested back off.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Ask him if he likes you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> So now your asking for the car back.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> A freak that looks, and acts like a good girl.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Get freaky, and dont be boring...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> yeah, why dont u propose to him give it a chance?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> he wants to work things out with me, but he is a cheater.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> i am sorry but he should not have took the dare that was a stupid move.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> We are taught from a young age to not be emotional (Big boys don't cry, etc.)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> So, just talk to him and be friends.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> i risked my heart with a man who cheated on me.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> Shaggy...it's so fun to make it all messy!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> They get mad if they gain a pound!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> But if she doesn't, ASK HER!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> But be aware that if u wanna be more than friends, u can ruin the whole being friends part.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> No, there are so many really good guys out there that would treat you right, you deserve better
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> girls are drawn to guys that are jerks this just perpetuates the behavior.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Maybe she has reasons, ask her!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> You cant be sure if she likes you unless you ask.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> If he wants to marry her just be happy that he has met some one who makes him happy!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> just readin ur question makes me hot
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> how old is to old that is the question?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> cause girls are girls and we are picky
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> 1. she will flute with u 2. she will tell u (hopefuly after u ask her )
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> If she is ready then theres nothing wrong in having sex with her.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> Clitoris...it will feel AMAZING for her and will be fun for you to play with too.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_30> it wont beeasy if u do find it.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> a cuckold is a husband whos wife is cheating on him
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> brazil has my vote, Sao Palo very steamy year round
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> I think so, 'cause I'm the same way.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> BBW or a large girl or woman doesn't mean that their not healthy.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> At least I think she does.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> he likes u or hes just crazy and anooying or a stalker
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> p's if u want 2 ans dis question add ur phone no or ur e-mail address
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Still you need to tell her that his your man not yours.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> cuddling is always fun... but I guess that might be sexual stuff.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> WHERE YOU LEAST EXPECT HIM TO BE.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> I dont kno if he likes u but u should talk 2 him cause he might be shy.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> yes be optimistic as i am
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> girl on her back, guy on his knees.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Once trust is gone, no matter how much you forgive you will never forget.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> maybe he shy so try it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> hang out with your freind  but stay with b/f and see what happens
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> grab her back side kiss her
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> i need help on this one man!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> you may find that without the pressure you want her even more than you ever had .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> maybe she doesn't like you so why bother??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> You sound like a nice guy 'thickchix'.. you'll do just fine.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> If all else fails, laughter always works and friends help too.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> I have a friend who just moved to Arkansas from here in Oregon who is interested in internet dating.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> dont have a name like wanna be a playboy its just my guess man  but that might help
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> I Love You Hunnie Loads and Loads
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> avoid perfume and things like that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> tickets to his favorite sports event.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> I like the saying   If it's to be It's up to me!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> the more sexy a girl dresses the more she turns on a man
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> hey, that is my favorite too !
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> maybe u r looking for other love.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> maybe he has problems or something.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> do it that is what mine did to me, it is funny.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> And to all who reads this SCORPIO'S RULE!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> Yeah cause that makes it special and you will remember it!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> (( you don't make sense I won't make sense)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> be the bigger person and just ingore it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> LOL, I am fat...so I'll give you a great answer.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> In short, if she thinks she looks good, she'll feel good!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Do nothing and keep you mouth shut.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> if your scared don't do it
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> If you like him and enjoy hanging out with him then talk with him and hang out.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> so just chalk this one up as a learning experance, and go on and enjoy life.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> I think it is quite cute.........McDonalds is a relaxing place where you can hang out and have fun!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> But even if you explore your options... it still doesn't mean you're Bi.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> 8th grade is too young to date, baby!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> cant nobody help u have sex.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> what does the new girl think of her?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> so what you call a good kisser and might not be what i like.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> why don't you kiss him first  and stop waiting on him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> what does the new girl think of her?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Go ahead, just go up and ask, maybe just go as friends.. Good Luck ;)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> so what you call a good kisser and might not be what i like.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> why don't you kiss him first  and stop waiting on him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> i was kinda let down cuz it wasnt wut i expected, but the next time was much, mucn better
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> why not go out with one of those other 50 ppl?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> there are plenty of horny men out there on the net.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> my wife is beautiful, kind and smart.......
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> ITS BETTER THAN YOU HEARD, IF YOUR DOING IT RIGHT.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Under no circumstances do you EVER allow things to shift the other way......ever!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> But if one or both of you still cannot get over, don't be friends.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> alot of girls judge and look at other girls.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> To all the guys out there: GROW UP!!!!!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Everyone is right - you can't mess up.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Hes happy with her but then again hes not.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Slowly start to flirt with him and if he flirts back..then you know he likes you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> dont think it is quite normal.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> i do believe that they are ALWAYS there, not only these days
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> we both work hard and earn good money.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> Most guys that are obsessed, are the main ones to stalk you.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> well lets just say sometimes i feel no love from him!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> if she's just trying to be all kool she's not.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> If you cant you'll never get over it.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> dont seek revenge and forget about him and move on.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> I cant believe your asking that question you sick-O he he just playin>;-)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Do people ever get over it or do they just learn to deal with it?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> You see the girl of my dreams is Tank Girl.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> Now she wants to kick me out.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> hmm.. i think he still wants you physically..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just act like you want to be friends with the guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> I do wish you luck........I know it is hard!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> You should ask questions like whats going on and why hes acting funny..
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> that's what makes this country so great...we get to have that!!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> but don't mind them all cause when u fall in love.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> is he taking the whole lying thing too far or am i?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> NOW IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR YOU TO LEAVE HIM ALONE.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> Ok this question is just too good to pass up.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> if not, then tell me and i'll be glad to take it from here!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> people fall in love because some people are beyond just liking.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> how u gone ask some people u dont even know?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> (My bf does that sometimes too.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> It's not that bad if you already tried it anally.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> just ask him what's wrong, delaying this issue won't work.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_10> THAT IS THE STUPIDEST QUESTION I HAVE EVER HEARD!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> i found out through his mother.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> never know til you find out
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> I also like guys with big soft lips.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> You need to dump his ass.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> Ok, so i got this crush on a best friend of mine and he knows.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> men lie because they think its right to try to protect u from the truth by trying to lie
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> If the freindship is real he wont get hurted
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> So:Say what you think before it's to late!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> TO DREAM A DREAM, IS ONLY A DREAM, BUT TO DREAM OF THE ONE YOU LOVE IS REALITY!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> There is no answer except for this:  ONLY TIME WILL TELL.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> I AGREE WITH   MN_SASSYGIRL    PLUS AN  EXOTIC LONG HONEY MOON AFTER THAT(HAY DIOS MIO)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> He's in jail now because of this guy I am friends with.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> it said ask any question...I wanted to see what would happen
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> find something else to do , occupied ur mind with something else.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> they are both very samrt and mature if that helps any...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> you need to stay away from that guy
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> You have to believe it to, so get out there, watch, listen, and then talk!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> because people just love talking about sex
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> That guy is so handsome, he must be gay.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> Maybe next time though, dont always give too much hope on a guy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> But that is the way it goes.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> ask him if he will pray with you for guidance.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Are u asking guys or girls
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> maybe u should use stronger deodorant.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> why do you call yourself ' black ' ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> No, your just not doing it right if you think that..
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> it wont hurt infact ull feel much better(trust me on this)
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> i really like him, and i know he likes me, but how do i get things started?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> they're just telling u what they think of ur bf...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> If she likes you too, then...  What more could you ask for?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> its really hard when u want to know what happened.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> Ur ex: Does this dress look fat on me?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> call her say I LOVE YOU
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> love is joy, obsession is where the pain comes in.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> 16 minimum; preferrably when you are 18.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> (not that many explamantion points though)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> Give him a hard time too while your at it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> dont be her friend she will just stab you in back.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> well 'NO' if she asks she is not a nice girl
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> still can't figure it out myself.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> MY OPINION....you did kinda put yourself out there.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> a viberator is a dil do.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> it is wat it is means drop watever u were talking about
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> Unless she is a millionaire dont just hang on.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> there's lots of stuff you can do.
<NbChars_35> <LevSim_35> i only like him as a friend,                                                                 English!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> be nice he is confused himself what to do
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> NOW Ur ANSWER:JUST LET IT HAPPEN DON'T TRY TOO HARD B/C U'RE GOING TO FAIL
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> I feel I'm ready to start meeting people again but have to confess that I'M SCARED!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> Of course I was cheap and only took her out to IHOP once.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> the second was actually one of my managers, which worked for a while (nobody knew).
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_25> u have a chance cause she misses u
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> great question...you make me blink and think.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> boys dont ever know what they are talking about.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> or should i date someone older?
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_25> once you get invoved it automatically goes both ways.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> I hate hair that is tooo short.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Do you know what your best friend feels about this?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> (I tell guys that I like them, it's really simple!)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> got a divorce because of it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> if u had legitement reasons why u lied, u should explain to him why.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> It definitly has to be Face to Face.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> The person YR looking for is not me.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> if you are that daring, then go for it.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> AS SOON AS U FIND OUT THAT THE  PERSON IS USING DRUGS.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I guess it would be wrong to ask you to send video of what you've been doing?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> men like for u to chase them...see what happens when u stop calling him
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> And then they had a small buffet, even though there were over 250 guests!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> You are looking for a fix me up guy.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> If I like my girl I would never do act that way.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> i mean the matter is does it make you happy or not>?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> should i just start being mean or something?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> i need a wife to be with.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> email me and I will show you pics
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Guys that smell like armpits and patchouli!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> ... it's EXPERIENCE and WHOLE life!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> watch how you carry yourself around.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> I mean he cute but my friends call him monkeyboy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Personally I like to woo hoo!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> of course... go with the one who loves me....
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I am in my late 20's with no kids.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_35> no, if you break up it will be a mess
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> It sounds corny, but girls love it and it's a whole lot of fun.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> wtf do you think you're gonna do if you get pregnant before you even reach high school?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> !other than bein controled by someone.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> My advice to you...stop sleeping with him and move on.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> Much less be married or have kids with one?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> You can't help who you fall in love with, can you???
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> maybe you should learn to spell women.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> I say hey sometimes or just let him stare.But is he just too young to understand how I feel?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> dont try to start out with saying you like him.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> show him why he should like you then let him ask you out.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_45> You were wrong and I hope you go to jail.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> They can pick up on that stuff.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> She may be hurt, but she'll respect you enough that you told her (at least I would think so!)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> no, it shouldn't do that unless you actually go into the site.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> probably he's afraid that you might say no.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> It's different and OH MY GOD!!!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> If usay they fat and there's a size 5-6 then they get mad.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Hope you figure out what his up to.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> Something like What the hell are you thinking?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> I don't know, maybe you should go ask your mom that question?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> umm no friends have their opinoins but you dont have to take them.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> he will kiss you if you give him the chance, or you might have to kiss him first
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> try meeting them there and be late.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> That's what a big man would do
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> Dang, dude, you are WAY to young!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> **WHATEVER YOU DO DON'T PURSUE HIM!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> see i love my boyfriend very much.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> say no,,, freindship means so much than sex dude
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> Sue the pants right off of both.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> i want to sleep with this guy i have been seeing for 1 month, he is so hot.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> try match.com u could always have a profile on many of them to increase ur chances
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> i would much rather be with a person who is complete then looking for me to complete them!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> okay just give me your eamil add..  i will tell you about her.. ot email me at  confusedmemore@yahoo.com
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> your next door neighbor only if she is over 22, unmarried.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> i'm talking about researching about apartments, good jobs, and a nearby school, etc.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> THE DAMAGE HAS BEEN DONE, AND APOLOGIZING WON'T HELP HER SITUATION.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> yes u should get it i got mine today.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> Just don't lie, what ever you do.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> When we first got together she tried to get him back but it didnt work
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> she needs someone to lean on not kiss on.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_25> i think i may know you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> - if he 'hates' you then why would you want him to like you anyways?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> I act too much like one of the guys, joking or whatever, and I'm just not girlfriend material.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Eventually she'll see that you really do care about her and she'll come around!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Or just leave things the way they are and call it good.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> boys- how long do you want a gurl to wait to say she loves you?would you say it first?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> Either that or his pretty blue eyes *wink*
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> try to chat with her on the topic of herself onlf.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> all you have to do is be cool and trie not to studder or something like that
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> Then maybe you should breakup with her and get with me
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> tell me about yourself if you are looking for a freind
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Look in the phone book of norwalk, for ernie anguino .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> just think if sombody touches ur wife wold u like.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> after 8 years... what is his problem?
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> Then maybe you should breakup with her and get with me
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> Look in the phone book of norwalk, for ernie anguino .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> just think if sombody touches ur wife wold u like.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> after 8 years... what is his problem?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Good luck, it's not easy, I know.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> I really think you guys need to get in to family therapy right away!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> don't keep bugging her - girls hate it so much!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> try to understand that unless you make a stupid thing they won't laugh at you.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> How can I overcome this friends!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> <33 if u feel this way then maybe ur fallin in luv!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> Some guys just don't know HOW LUCKY THEY HAVE IT !!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> be a gentalmen all girl's love that.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> because it sounds like either a trap, or the beginning of a fight.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> yes, but they're extremely hard to find.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> If it seems that shes doing something snicky that probably means shes with him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Oh i would so love to be your friend!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Please, I really like this guy, help me!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> its his job to make your life hell.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> good things come to thows who wait...besides hes problably waiting for a speacial moment
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> if you do make sure you keep reciepts of the stuff which is yours!
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> Go somewhere you'd have fun anyways.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> And laugh and see what he says.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> waiting for something miraculous to happen isnt going to make it better.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> you should tell her that hes pissin u off.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> If he's not ready he's not ready.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> If you love him than who cares if he's purple.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> you are so right about the GOD thing
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> MY BROTHER IS OLDER BUT HE STAYS FOR HIS GAMES
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> no i urinate when i urinate.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Ya go the car back so your not totaly finanicaly ruined.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Yes I do and I am one of them
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> why do people think that other peopl will make them whole.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> IT'LL BE MORE LIKE POORING SALT OVER A OPEN WOUND.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> or are you just doing it for the heck of it?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> take me with and ill have it with you
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> i too have found that many people don't believe in true love.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_25> ), play catch at the park, etc.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> Even if she argues back...just stick to your first responce!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> You shouldn't have a hard time getting somebody else if you doing it big like that.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> but if things don't get to well, don't worry.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> look both ways and then look up.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> i dunno, do they have it there or u'r inviting?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> im 10 am i to young for my first kiss?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> He may be to afraid to try!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> If I was your wife (thank God im not) I would leave you!!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> There maybe an under lieing problem.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Its like trying to make a herion addict stop shooting up.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> he has been talking to his ex wife a lot and i dont know whats up with him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> because coyness is sometimes appealing, and talk sometimes unnecessary, for both men and women
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Oh, and if you can remember anniverseries, birthdays, etc.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> If not, then kick both of them to the curb.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> swift kick you know where, or just flat out embarress him
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> because he's weird and he can't control his impulses
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> She wont ever cheat on anyone again.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> wait untill the answering machine clicks to hang up?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> But Don't Be COMPLETELY Slutty (No Offense)!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> even if he looks at girlie mags or watches porn.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> gET AS MUCH FOR YOUR MONEY THAT YOU CAN AND GOOOO FOR IT.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> You have the rest of your life...whatever you do, don't sneak behind your mom's back.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> EVERYONE does it and if they say they don't, then they lie.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> a guy that i am dating once told me this, what does he mean?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> show to him that you like another guy !
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> Most men ask her thing they dont want like a relationship and some lie to get what they want.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Find at least 10 girls you'd be interested in.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> flirt for a while, then ask him out
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> His or her mother did not have too, he or she  did.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> DON'T FORGET HE IS YOUR FRIEND'S BOYFRIEND.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> The only reason for a guy to become best friends with a girl, is cuz he likes her.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> Meanwhile go out and have fun.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> if its too many then spare him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> IN ORDER TO FRENCH KISS SOMEONE YOU HAVE TO USE TONGUE.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> follow her and tell her how u feel...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Don't wait.....what if he goes with someone else!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> you should wait a while then sit down and talk about it.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> IF U GET UR BUTT OFF THE COMPUTER AND TRY 2 FIND SUM1 U MIGHT!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> I'm attractive and fun but I just can't seem to get a guy.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> thats nasty but just say its over
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Myself, I'd rather my girlfriends did *not* think my guy was the cutest one out there.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> if they really want me they need to prove themselves worthy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> 4get him gurl i mean there 's tons of guy's out there!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> u should move on but still keep n i out(u nevr kno).
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> Is it a guy or girl?
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> i think it is till you get matured on the stuff
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> don't neglect yourself because you are married.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> If that doesn't work, something's definitely wrong.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> maybe because they think they are too good for anyone!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> id think just sit on his lap and make him laugh and make him think about sex
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> we`re not in the middle ages, the guy doesn`t have to make the first move!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> I really REALLY wish I could have waited until marriage actually.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Guys love being told they are liked.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> my husband when he gets home from work
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> maybe you should try to keep all three people in mind.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> forget his age, immagine him as the best..
<NbChars_40> <LevSim_20> Good luck Sweety, Tina, Houston, Texas
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> who will let me stick my tounge down thier throats.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> She is carrying a lot of baggage you ain't gonna get on the train.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> If your scared, you shouldn't be having sex in the first place...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Stick to your guns and best of luck!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> You know what I'm talkin' about.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> thats ok ill take the 2 points and run
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> and aways get us a gushy card and gift that's great, too.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> At least that's what it seems like.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i find it difficult to confess.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> Well...if you love him, and he loves you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> There's this guy I like ALOT and I just found out that he knows.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Try Gerber Daisies they came in just about every color and size you could ever want.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> I don't care what these other people said.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> he slept with 2 of my friends, and is not a resposible guy.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> u dont have to make a choice right now.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> It just ain't going to happen.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> YOU WENT THROUGH SUCH EXTREME TO GET THIS WOMAN BACK THAT YOU HURT INNOCENT PEOPLE.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> Needless to say, I had VERY happy feet!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Do you know what I say .
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> To me skinner girls are hotter.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> MY BEST EXPERIENCES IS TURNING MY LIFE OVER TO JESUS CHRIST THAT WAS THE BEST EXPERIENCES
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> If she is a nice & carring person isn't that enough!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> I'm not for doing kids wrong.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> i learned after 20 years that they were both no good.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> so go ahead and do the rite thing!say sorry to her!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> because it teaches guys how to get laid for less money .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> i dunno if he has those feelings for me.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> See if he wants to watch a movie together that you know he'd like.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> and u'll see for urself what can love do!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> It got to the point that to me men were like tissue: soft, cuddley and disposible!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> may be she is not a lesbain after all...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> No offense, but Jupiter is saying that because he's a guy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> if u both r deep in love and u r old enough, there is no harm in going ahead
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> be confident men... just do it....all the best
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Why do so many men treat women like garbage?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> Just hang in there, it'll get better!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> if she hasnt said it first ask her if she loves u and go from there.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> If she's an outdoors person, go to the beach (take a walk, build a sand castle, etc.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> i think the fact that you called him means that your ok to see him.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Did Honey wanna f@(k not work?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> You would be better taking sugar pills and think in your head its getting bigger.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> soul mate = 1.. true love = maybe 2..just having fun lovers = as many as will have you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> I wouldn't want them gunning for him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> We just play dumb so we get what we want.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> you not the one to marry her, is you family holyer than his?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> I have a friend whos dad just died.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> Don't walk, but run from him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> blow him once and awhile he will like that
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> i read the fountainhead before i was thirteen yrs old
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> <insert women opening up to their husbands joke here>
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> after a while, it'll get easier.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> He probably wouldnt be expecting to meet someone that way!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> But some women are just like that SO Good luck!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> WOW thats a weird question to come out of a girls mouth.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> im just saying u could one day just walk out da door nd find da girl of u dreams.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> Now..........I have to go have my shoulder blades worked on.......we'll talk soon.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> Y 21, TRY A SLIGHTY OLDER ONE...SAY AROUND 26....THEY LAST LONGER AND THEY KNOW WHAT THERE DOING
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> clitoris but before that nipples :p and before that, lips and neck, behind the ears...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I just do this to get those stupid points.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> everyone seems to think that i am the naive one, but i know i'm not.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> make a new friend and wait ten years
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> is not good for you , and can tear you apart.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> If you care for him stay with him!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> i know guys who are friends with girls they are attracted to.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> i like my best(guy) friend&my other best friend thinks he likes me.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_35> if he is all those things then i would go as far as he wants to go with me.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> If you care for him stay with him!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> i know guys who are friends with girls they are attracted to.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> i like my best(guy) friend&my other best friend thinks he likes me.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> if he is all those things then i would go as far as he wants to go with me.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> Be yourself, your awesome enough, don't put on a show.....Don't do anything I wouldn't do.....lol
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> what kaitlyn said im sorry im no help its my job to disappoint people
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> Then hey, i wish all my x's where like u.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> seriously you can just sit there and everything will be okay.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Any advice .. Should I ask him what he feel really towards her and what he feel towards me?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> no i think it is not possible.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> The way I see it, is if they dont want to be with me then leave.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> im in love and im not sure to ask her on a date
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> I mean really if we had a perfect person, they woudn't be any fun.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> Suprise him and kiss him first.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> and dating only gets better with age.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> All I know is boredom is cause by too much want(input) and no output at all...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Simple as it is   read a love story b4 u go to bed!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> its impossible to blow if your not hard
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> I love this girl who just wants to be friends now.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> there has to be some plus to being married.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_65> Unless you are a glutton for punishment then go ahead!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> Just wondering, lots of wolves out there.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> quietly and plz shut the door when you leave ...........
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> there are a lot  single women out there that don't want to commit.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> Wish my man would do some of this!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> there's no way that you could do that.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> if u dont like me i cant help it i like myself very much
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> Whenever I see a girl I think of flirting with her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Yes but in reality it is probably lust at first sight :)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> A hug will make her want more!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> buy her flowers  take her to the movies.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> haaaaaaahahahahahahaha  I bet I know what YOU'RE doin right now....
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> if you love him than i think you schuold but u should follow your heart
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> us men have to be trained to be able to do anything
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> I met my husband 8 yrs ago, and have been married for almost 6
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> And you'd know it for sure.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> I know they work...and no I did not lie.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> YES YES YES Dont kiss anyone till ur 15yrs.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> she just want's this guy to like her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> So, here is how it went.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> u dont no what a vibrator is!!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> I tell her she is not.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> no it means ur pretty open to such things.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> I'm comfortable with that, but I can't get him out of my mind like that.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> no, it will alter the way he thinks about you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> cheating is not the right word.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> ask them if they are interested in e-mailing you then give them your e-mail address along with ur question
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Lot of people saying the boy is young and immature.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> i agree with Dee, if a cheater gets married hes a rotten twofaced dink wad!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> and i can assure you she'll say it back!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> personally have no use for drugs and a friend who peddles the crap is no true friend
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> yeah what do you got to lose unless you are a hooker
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Anyways, I know you probably love that person very much, so don't forget him and leave.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> You definitely look like more of a lil ***** by not GETTING OVER IT!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> I really want to talk to him but I'm really shy and just can't do it!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> it throws them off gaurd and guys like to be ontop of things and in control.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> i look into her eyes and say would you like to go halfs on a kid
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> if he does not then work with him to show him where he went wrong.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> wait for her to give u it
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> Hi,I would not depend on your spouce putting you first !
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> ), and don't look around (you're with this guy, no one else in the room!).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> You might just have an awsome bod.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> he is silly... get him back..
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Everything was good but he cheated on me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> if it feels like it is time to break up, talk it over and make it happen now.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> He just thinks he wants that skinny little French girl.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Sex isn't for singles it for Married people.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> It hurt's people sure but that's ok.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> But would you tell your ex somethin like thst put your self in her position.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> Not all guys are complete jerks.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Dont feel to bad we all have our issues.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> E-mail me back and tells me how it goes
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> Well dont ask him out just yet!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> so though u r hurt, love is still the simplest reason y u find urself happy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> regretful and dissatisfied...u know how unexperienced guys are..sloppy!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> girls- when will you tell him you love him?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> does this guy hang around u and if he does,does he act different around u than others
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> God has someone which is best for you.. just wait!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> i love him it is a boy
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> I DJ in clubs and other places, and the ladies room is the best place for gossip!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> he's really cute he's been really good to me
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> I want to be married by Elvis!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> Some just wanna have a fling.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_30> Now that we all know, and we approve *wink*, go tell her!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> i am 13 and i told a guy that i liked him over email.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Thats tough do you know why they are talking so much lately ?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Wait until ur married but i prefer 17.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Life to short to loose the one u really think is for u
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> just tell them, its easier that way.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Curious... Why ask the question at all?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> u will someday find out it is unexplainable
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> a simple charming kiss with a red rose
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> show them, hep them, and stuff.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> see where it goes from there
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> because its more fun to have options, maybe.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> that sucks, courts can be so messed up, hope u find a nice girl who wont try anything bad.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> In any case, the don't's are: don't get drunk (nurse one or two), don't talk about exes(!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> Maybe he doesn't like NASTY stuff.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Listen to what she has to say (and I don't mean hear, I mean to really LISTEN.)
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> does that mean i am bi?
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_35> make a pro & con list for each man.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> no, you shouldn't cheat if you are having a good relationship.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> Give it to her then treat her like the slut she is.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> call from cell and tell her to get tickets.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Because the first time you really don't know what you are doing
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> ok why would you want enlarge it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Try this :-) Look up on google what various flowers mean.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> My boyfriend is obsessed with me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> I love her... Well i'm 17 so she is my age but its an unachievable dream.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> there is some1 out there better for her.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_10> TRY ME, I MEAN TRY IT
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> dont just treat it as a bargain, make her think your into it too.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> just b urself and have a good time!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> If you like him too, date him again.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> sure...u just have 2 know where 2 search...!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> Will she ever get over it?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> because we dont want to feel rejected by the person we like or think we like
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> you just aint doing it right.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> WEll, aparentally it is different 4 everyone, are u sure HE is the one
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> MR RIGHT and MR HONEST and no cheating on them
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> do this for her and then you'll be able to ask for something you want.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> what school do you go to?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> It sure is alot easier on me, but it kinda hard on the woman.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_40> you do it right there on the spot
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> if you have a good personality then you will get a girl.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> there are millions of woman out there like that.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> i prefer guys with short hair its better
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> M  ITS EASY TO GET IN, BUT SIMPLIFIED ITS REAL HARD TO GET OUT.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> swinging, cuckold refers to a husband who gets sexually aroused seeing his wife with another man.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Well as a chick im hoping u arent to outright eg.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> !im single and im havin the time of my life!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> always ask if it is ok.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> Maybe a makeover is just what she needs.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> You know, the one person you want to spend the rest of your life with?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> but he was in the air force, so that didn't work out.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> But to me like I said I'm not fat.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> eventually u'll see the 'girl' in the girl.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> We still talk and e-mail once in a while.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> are there honest, attractive, availible women out there?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> Or is it true once a cheater always a cheat?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> give more details if you want a real answer
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> and if you realy like her bring a tocken of your affection.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> buy her flowers or something that she likes that will get her attention.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> What if he likes me but only as just a friend?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> well if i broke up w/ someone i would want them to wait at least a week or so...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> dont go with her keep away......
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> If she wants someone else other than you, tell her to try it, why not?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> If the girl loves the guy, then tell him so.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> works for me on men that are just friends.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> If u cant deal with that, then leave her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> If you know he cheated not once, but at least twice there is no way he'll suddenly reform.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> no really only you know this get real
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> postion to do if you really wanna hit the g-spot..
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> I like guys with like three feet of hair.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> HOWEVER... there are some really great guys out there.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> keep the faith baby others are out there and when in doubt just look in the mirror and smile.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> If I was getting married for the first time???
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> first u have to get to know the person you are going out with.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> I know its hard to resist, but one day you wont even think about you friend
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> you can't it's in our nature to have a wondering eye
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> But for me, I like an honest man.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> or does he need to get his s**t together?
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_30> Move on dude, she's a playa'

<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> your choice i'd say yes if hes a  hot guy
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> men and women are different in thinking and feeling.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> he likes u hez a stalker or he haz starin probz!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> IF YOU ARE A TRUE FRIEND YOU WILL FORGET ABOUT THAT ONE GUY.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> do they like to be babied?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> that info is everywhere...even on ur computer just type in sex education or something

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> dude no man just do what ya do ya only got life once email at shadepearson@yahoo.com
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> then you dust yourself off and then you meet someone else and she breaks your heart.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> if he knows.... ...doesnt have a girlfriend ...and ur 2 shy.....?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> ALL guys say they'll never cheat.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> i have a realation with aboy lately.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Well I think you should ask him?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> so if he's smart then no, he won't.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> : if you can't get a moan, use something that will.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Me I look for a guy that is confident but not cocky.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> Be honest, be yourself, say it like it is, guys will dig you more.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Good luck and let me know...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Save urself money & hurt, get a parrot.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> let someone else do it for you .
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> If you really like this guy then go up to him and talk.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> well....if u start now and plan for u and ur baby's future, then u'll be set.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Especially when I could beat them in dodge ball!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> what are the signs and what should i be worried about?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> whatever, so what if they are playing.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> See, two can play that game!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> maybe you should ask your mom!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> If you use a telliphone then its kinda stalkery.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> If things get frisky from there on out........you are in!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> playing with emotions doesnt make a man cool, but makes him lowdown.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> tell him that he is fat and ugly andpenis is huge like mine,babe
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> It ROCK MY FREEKIN SOCKS OFF!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> And let me tell you it wont ever go completly away.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> If you're really good friends don't go there girl.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> preferably long, no longer than shoulder length though
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> I really love my baby's father and I want to get back together with him.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> u will know which gal to choose when the time is right.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> leave things the way they are not too close not too far itll all fan out in the end
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> no matter what tho, it's all about the proposal.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> if not, then next time date someone else.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> At times it is but never doubt until you catch the other person then you will know.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> It is definitely NOT just men :o)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> DiiNER  HEY B-BALL SOMETHING I THOUGHT U WERE 6 AND U ALREADY HAVE A GIRL FRIEND?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> Once a cheater, always a cheater.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> sex is a very serious thing and you should definately wait.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> If it is bothering her STOP!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> I haven't cheated on any of my g/f's.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Not all guys are cheat on their g/f's.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> man just go ahead n tell her trust me i recently had to do this!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> INSTEAD OF WASTING UR TIME ASKING RETARTED QUESTIONS!!!!!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> It sucks for a shy person, I know, but you will be so glad you did!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> who would want someone who is mean to them?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Im not kidding when my wife cleans house and then says she loves me I wanna nail her.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> And most girls will stab you in the back for a guy.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> just wondering what some people feel guilty about
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> 5 years is more then enough time.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> that way it's just long enough to pull and have it hurt.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> i do sex when i am having sex
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> Your money sure won't buy you a golden ticket then.
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_30> first do not go down to his level.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_25> I am not gay and it bothers me that they think I am!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> Boys just wanna be ha ard, Ohhhhh boys just wanna be hard.
<NbChars_390> <LevSim_20> Who wants to date a wuss?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> YOU CAN'T MARRY YOUR DOG EITHER, ARE YOU MAD ABOUT THAT TOO?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> boys like to play games in order to get girls to like them.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Listen in on a group of men talking.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Trust in what you have..........you know and she knows.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> But most men have it in check.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Yeah you probably shouldn't feel like that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> If you like both, you're just bisexual.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> maybe u should talk to him first when ur around ppl
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> so all in all they can be very hot many different ways.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> If you haven't walked away yet, walk away RIGHT NOW!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Because Women or Girls always want the guys to want it 24/7.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> Some really can't find contentment and a lot have commitment issues :-)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> THIS IS GOOD THAT HE WAS OPEN ENOUGH TO TELL YOU.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> they would always lie to me about my spouse and it caused alot of problems.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> I AM 30/W/F, I WANT TO MEET SOMEONE PERHAPS THROUGH THE INTERNET, BUT EVERYWHERE I LOOK THEY WANT MONEY,MONEY,MONEY.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> i wud suggest u stay away from these type of guys especially if u r decent n have morals.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> to soon.dont ruin someone elses life, even if you dont care about your own
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> if you are a guy, go to mensfacts.com lots of sexlife info
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> i would but you live to far away
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> thats like asking out the new kid that doesnt even kno every1's name.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> Hopefuly,u'll be ready for her;When u do.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> if you want to see him more, tell him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Look sometimes girls say that to see what u are going to say.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> AND ... for the idiots who think that ALL women over 30 sag, droop, etc.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> WHERE DOES HE PUT HIS PENIS, IN THE HARD DRIVE??????
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> um glad you 2 werked it out!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> But he could not do the same.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> why not before it is done?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> And don't get all fired up and yell when the child does stuff like burping.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> keep her around but don't lie to her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> im confused, i dont know if it is coz she was my 1st love.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> I actually prefer bald men lol
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> and then when ur dun then go and liv w/ him!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> k, well, ummm, u sound um, seriously seriously um, immature and hot on yourself!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Now why in the world would u want to rattle with that mess.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> thats why they love older women dear.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> i seen her for one night, and i for got to give my name and phone number.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> 2) What are you looking for in a woman?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Why would you even want to?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Why do guy's be like that?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> then you'll know the answer to your own question.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Maybe shes just scared that she mite get pregnant or sumthing, have u ever thought of that?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> it teaches women how the average man thinks.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> it'll make u feel better : )
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> yes most probabily when there left no attrecttion for you
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> How do you know he is that shy?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> Hey, I was going to ask the same exact question!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> *sigh* That's the part of love that is so hard.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> ur husband,u can always marry a star.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> i am interested n am indian of almost dark colour
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> i'm wondering if she cheated on you or if it was you who cheated on her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Is he very.. how do I say this... geeky?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Damn where is y'll self- respect?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Sorry... No you cannot be friends and still have a good conscience.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> I AM CUTE,PETITE AND LOVABLE, EVEN A LITTLE OLD FASHION!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> But then I rememered one thing that my father had told me.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> I could neva b sexier bcuz I would b jealous of myself.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> they have a baby together but they werent like that when i first met him
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> Plus, men are idiots (no offense)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> ask him out or just ignore him
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> And you would do anything for that person.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Since you're a guy, there really isn't any too ugly.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> just tell her like you told us.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> wait until a couple years after your married
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> no no and no and no
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> There's improv theater that's like omfg so funny.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> my best friend just found out that another one of our really good friends has developed feelings for her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> it all depends on how much they have matured.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Ask her why she doesnt want you dating.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> well if ur active, then just be less active.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> as long as she dont smack you
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> Do not go back with him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> look and ask is this the right one and if he or she is then go for it.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> she wud definitely like to talk about herself.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> just ask him and if he doesn't answer keep bugging him until he does.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> girls like that are hard to come by.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> Ask him ask him ask him ask him!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_10> SO WHATS GOOD ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP?
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> Not long like girl's hair long.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> it depends on wut your like and how old you are!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> e-mail me ur pic at rubyheartsjimmy@yahoo.com
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> or we just want to get along .
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> WHAT DO I DO HE SAID HE DIDNT CHEAT BUT I DONT BLIEVE IT!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> But maybe one time when u guys r talking n jokin around, tell him, imagine if we went out?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> yes u can but u don't have a girlfriend and i don't have a boyfriend.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> don't strive for someone that seems better than you, they probably aren't.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> well...do U like this Josh guy enough to sit around and wait for him to do something?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> (chopper)sometimes he would be out there all day and night and not even say anything to me!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> WHY DO GUYS HAVE TO ACT SO PRIMATIVE?!?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> where you don't make a fool of yourself and you both had fun!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> ask your friend what kind of boy she/he likes.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> becuase he may not feel confotable.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> also, guys usually get defensive when they have something to hide.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> If he says no and goes soft - bingo.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_35> on a break up someone always get hurt.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> id like to know that myself.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> If you like him, then go talk to him.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> been married twice, just be careful.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> First off age ain't nothing number.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> Don't feel bad and just get you a REAL man.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> in a jokin yet serious way(if thats possible).
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> then you can say to him now that we have help to educate you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> (IN NO WAY AM I JUSTIFYING CHEATING.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> can guys seriously not tell the difference between just being plain nice and flirting?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> yep thats what BOYS want, but I guess you werent asking what MEN want.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> have fun adn forget about him1 and you gave me answer about blodnes and i'm a brunette!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Take notes if you have to!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> THAT'S IT JUST A GOOD LOVER IN THE BEDROOM.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> i agree wit that oen answer if u concider them chicks go wait a very long time
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> boys want soemone that looks good, is very nice and caring and is not really shy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Love her and most important - FEEL PROUD OF YOURSELF!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> means heat and when you have sex you get heated up
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> well it all depends on what type of vibrator you have!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Say, Listen, bitch... if I can't have you alone I'll have you both.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> the first girl i fell for refused me & from then my condition has been like this.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> there are NO akward sex questions...
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> Dont get me wrong, its definetly not easy but that doesnt mean its a bad thing.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> YOU CAN GIVE HIM AN ULTIMATUM, YOU OR HIS MA,IF CHOOSES HIS MA YOU ARE WELL RID OF HIM.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> You can't tell on him/her, that would be messed up, because you are his/her friend.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> 2) your enganged to marry a man who had the same baggage.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> they are not even men when they don't do that.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> dont do anything like get drunk, that def.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> Even ppl in 90s can find true love!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> i am joshua, based in nigeria.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> Then burned them (never send him your letters!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> Boys will screw with you r head and lie..
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> Once she looks fab, go out somewhere fun, but not forcefully so.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_20> i divorced him becuase of these reasons.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> That's soooo not true for ALL guys!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> or is she messing with my head..?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I don't believe that there is just one person out there for you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> No stay with him forever and ever
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> so blame it on most of the fathers, not all of them, just most!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> i guess you physically look good and also  you good at in bed
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> thats not a problem.. just wait for the rigth one to come.. they are just around!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> That is, since you don't want any romantic ideas that lead to bed ;)
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> I hate knowing what you're going to say next.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Girls: I want him 2 hint it but then i would go and tell him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> because they are afraid that it will scare the guy.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Do not let him get to you!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> if you are life long buddies then you need to go out soon.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> chat with friends and how enter chat room
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Don't grab, but otherwise, it's not really a big deal.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> put some soap, vingar, or nail polish remover on your thumb.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> so that is just my opinion and othas mite add to it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> maybe not soon after they cheated but some time down the road.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> you got to act it out though.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> They were only getting married b/c she was pregnant.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> he sounds like a jerk, your a lot more important than a bunch of friends.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> So, I say, fresh start, new day.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> If you love him or feel a connection then don't break up with him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> also, it confims that you are proud and happy to be with the one you are with.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> Girls do tell you, just not in words.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> i think that u should date some one older than u cuz ppl talk .
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> I mean why go back to the crap?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> If it's something you like who cares WHY?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> Unless it's what you both want.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> im completely in love with a girl and its not right i want out i need advice.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> ask him the question, in some situation it is not good to sleep with someone right off the bat.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> i know you dont want to hear this, but you are too young.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> don't give him a hint, either.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> There have been so many times in my life that have left me saying WOW im glad im alive.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Open her eyes to wat shes doing and how shes thinking.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> u said hes ur friend so duh!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> REALLY SHORT HAIR BECAUSE IT FEELS SO GOOD WHEN YOU RUB YOU HAND OVER IT
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> You want women to buy YOU dinner and then you don't want anything sexual to occur?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> What if they start dating and he finds out abouthim.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> what is he/she is looking for?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> just do it like nike says.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> (i dont no wut dat means but sum1 els used it above me) wait about 10 years
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> And look real interested when she is talking.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Do not forget that you have a kid.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> Depends on how hard you work to get your crush to accept you
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> My friends are always all like Just go talk to him, all you have to do is say hi!

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> * move on *never follow or stalk him because then he'll think you're phsyco.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Although, we never forget our first loves!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> or he is waiting for the right time.

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> yes if u come to me
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Try making LOVE to her, instead of just having sex.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> no matter where you are or what you're doing, if she loves you, she won't care.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> in a way that you would not hurt someone....

<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> theres a lot better out there for you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> After reading the addtitonal details, it seems like you guys just want different things from life.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> Just one guy's opinion here in the Windy City!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Then have some1 else give it 2 him 4 you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> If asking her out feels kinda awkward is because it is!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> She thinks that she really likes this guy and WHAM, she gets another crush.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> treasure and be faithful to her, she deserved to be treated like a lady!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> 18 is fine for girls......21 for Guys.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> why do people fell in love.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> other wise it will just get worse.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> tell her how u feel if u dont like how ur relationship is working out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> No way its too soon, unless it was love at first sight!!!
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_50> Why wouldn't you get attached to some good sex??
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> After that, do some of your OWN flirting.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> make it in a way that both of you would not hurt someone.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> Because most women want a man of looks!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> But trust me there are good looking guys that will treat you good.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Life's a b---h then you die.

<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> I am 17 and I have been liking this guy for awhile now.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Well, everyone has different tastes in people... You like big butts, and you cannot lie.....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> I mean that really, special friend who listens intently.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Otherwise - Love & Use, full steam ahead.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> Heels are up to you but try Zappos.com
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> But i still think it may be a little jump
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> well I can think of a few ways !
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> and ask any elderly person from her family to advice her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> plus why a 15yo like a guy 20ysolder older than him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Girl ...don't get married to catch nobody ...BIG MISTAKE!
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> u dont have 2 have sex or even concider it as a date.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> if he's ok with that, then give the invitation.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> no matter what maner you chose to take the plundge, be up front and honest.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> i thank any latina can be sexy how old of a male you looking for lol.........Richard
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> that would prolly be the best way to handle it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> that's how women are so deal with it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> only thing was that he was cheatin on me and still coming back to me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> I was good friends with her sister.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> if you are not happy, then you should end it.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> I'd be afaid to be with a gay guy for that reason.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> first off you should only go as far as you are comfortable with.
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_40> How can a loser ever win?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_10> 1WHY WOULD YOUR SISTER TRY TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> hope all works out for you!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> Uber_wise_James Hit the Nail on the Head...
<NbChars_40> <LevSim_30> I feel really sorry for you.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> Maybe we are just to picky.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> i want to know how to impress boyz
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> bottem line, all that matters is if the 2 of u are on the same page about the relationship.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> its more personal...just see how these next few weeks go.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Sign up for some classes or courses (like art, music etc).
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> I still think he likes me.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Only if you're wife/church is telling you it is, and if they are.. run run run away from them.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> which is boy, which is girl?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> I thought I was going to spend forever with someone and that didn't happen.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> And I can find enough about myself to like that I don't need a man.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> write her note or get her email if she has it and send her your ?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Because boys are silly old chums who always want want they cannot recieve.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> buy some velour or velvet and drape from the ceiling over spa or bed
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> I THINK BECAUSE THEY DON'T TAKE RISK IN LIFE AND BAD BOYS ALWAYS DO.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> I guess the cat's out of the bag now!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> just remember you can't always get what you want.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> he won't get that promotion to buy women things later.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> maybe you need to confront him and see what is going on?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> I do not knwo....  Do you like to change people may be???
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Sounds like your thinking of killin the guy?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> No its not unless you let them know.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> is your first name pronounced win?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> but, just remember if he isnt undestanding about it, it could hurt you in the end...  all the best!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> he likes u all the way.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> It was fun acting like kids together.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> But I have a fondness for my awesome legs!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> If she does, and she stays even though she's unhappy, it's her own fault imo.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> joey p_p said it well: read and research this.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> BLIND DATE, hmmm.... go out with him, but please!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> you can always hustle candy at school or u can also try to become a prositute
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> I USE TO WEAR MY WEDDING BAND THEN ENGAGEMENT RING.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> when u both feel like it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i don't like the idea of him doing that but i couldn't change it.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> Yah, I know, u dont wanna rite.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> You just can not kiss up to his every need.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> if she has a problem feeling sexy, leave her and find a decent woman.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> it depends on the kind of girl you want.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Hope you dream of that special someone.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> i'd rather find them in real life.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> of coarse thats the best way to find someone for you
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> she is too young i would be looking for this girls mother and turning him in
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Maybe you should talk to the girl and tell her that
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> plz plz plz plz plz plz plz plz answer me baq thank you very much
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> phaze, but I am stii leary to no end.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Makeup your mind, if u think u are mature enough to handle such things.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> You shouldnt even think about doing this and if you do your so freakin' STUPID!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I dont know what to do Help:(
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Then stuff him into a 55 Gallon drum.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Keep her satisfied and you won't have to worry about it.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> and things like this are betterout then in.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> arrange one week of surprises for her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> Like I said, don't think bad, think good.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> but, you could have added a little bit more info.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Be with friends (but do not discuss it).
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> THE ONLY WAY YOU CAN DO THIS IS 1) DON'T MAKE A COMMITTMENT UNTIL AFTER YOUR DECISION.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> I can't tell you to wait because that would be unfair.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> !..give her a hug and listen to her and be nice!...good luck!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> You can love anyone you want...but that doesn't mean they're going to love you back.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> And he is like 6 years older than her!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Just do little things to let her know that you care
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> my mom is really conservative, but i love hickies.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> but should i make the first move and kiss him or wait untill he kisses me?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> Fortunatley I lived only 5 mins.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> it makes everything worth it...its all there really is in the end
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> I am now over that, All woman are EVIL!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> was i wrong to break it off because he lied to me about smoking weed?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> I HAVE A SAYING IN SPANISH (PERRO QUE LADRA NO MUERDE) DOG THAT BARKS ALOT,DON'T BITE!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> or just sling compliments his way, and appeal to his ego) good luck
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> thats love--something that'll last forever, even when you get wrinkly, even when you add some weight!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> plus some guys are scared of commitment and dont want 2 go further in the relationship cuz they scared.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> So u want to break up him cause lie about smoking weed.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Its not like you can help it, it is just the way you are.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Love doesn't cheat, it's a load of crap!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> your best bet is don't, thats usually a good way to lose a good friend.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_20> the  best  thing  i  have  ever  done  is  ride  the  dick!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Relationships don't have to be so hard.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> first year 2 times daily 2nd year one time daily 3rd year twice a week till 10 years .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> 3 months is just not enough time to know someone
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> btw~ I am not fat~ I am small and petite.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> if you're handsome most girls in that range like older men.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> Alot of gals get horny during their periods.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> i dont like math either but that doesnt make me less of a person.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> u r not going to lose anything.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> at first my mom didn't even know he was there.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Most people have no idea why they love the person they are with, they just do.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> nobodey lives in florida it's empty
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> u cant wrire man what the hell atr u saying
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> let it be done on u that u have better life ahead of u and u have know past
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_10> PICINIC, WALK BY LAKE, PARK ETC
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> oh my gosh I sould be so honored, I never thought you would ask.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> But remember to be safe.... get condoms
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> you said best friend with soulmate and etc etc.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> >>However, if she's pregnant, I'm not sure...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> the girls are beautiful but are they trustworthy.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> You want someone to agree with what you already know~                 THIS IS WRONG!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> 'Cause you are interested in that 51 year old married man
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and i don't think one certain hair length should be a turn on or off.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> So yeah, don't give hints about it, just ask and you will have a MUCH better chance.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> There's no mistaking it for anything!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> It is scary to think about, I completely agree with you!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> and btw, she can only see him if her parents let her, they dont go to the same school.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Not wrong if you're a dude.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> ask her out just like what she's been doing, as if she never heard anything.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> If he loves you that much you he will wait!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> check the chic out and be yourself.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> take gf to mall, take her into victoria's secret.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> but he didnt even pay att.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> no i so dont think thats wrong its normal
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> what type of girl r u asking cuz there will b diffrent answers....  lol for me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> one line advice is WIVES SUBMIT TO YOUR HUSBANDS, HUSBANDS SUBMIT TO YOUR WIVES.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> see she's in my basketball team and i think she's pretty hot, I like her personality just about everything.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_25> well i would say LEAVE HIM!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> I don't personally think it matters.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> Go to AA and or stop hanging out with people who drink.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Like Beyonce' says crazy in love.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> When she found out I ws already pregnant so she couldn't exactly kick him  out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Change the locks and tell him to go back home to his mama.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> It depends on the guy, I think.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Look your adults, Act like it!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> you should just find another guy that likes you likes you!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> I regret turning down good guys for jerks, cuz in the end I always lose.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> wow  you can actually hear these answers??
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> sometimes u only find out that u really loved someone, or didnt  when its over.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> but when you are ready that scary feeling wont be there anymore.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> :)have agreat life every one full of love and happnies
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> SO GO ON WITH YOUR BAD SELF AND FIND THE ONE .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Yes, as it's nice to be able to let rip!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Since we are just friends right now.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> it's a crush... they outgrow it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> i dont think u must be older than 16 years.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> find a nice place and pack a lunch (simple) wine,fruit,chicken,sandwich,(make it fun)
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> I'll feel funny if I don't.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Maybe just ask casually, Hey, you wanna go grab some dinner together tomorrow night?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> well it depends on how big he is.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> THERE WILL BE OTHER GUYS AND ALOT HARDER THINGS TO FACE THEN THIS.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> The problem is I dont love my self.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> But if it was me with no kids?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> But if your realy unsure get an honest friends opinion!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Can't wait to try it...whatever it is...I think...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> it is better to have 1....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> you are going to have a bf trust me have old are you ?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> What I used to do, as silly as it sounds.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> Which is cool with me, but I never ask her about sex again.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> you could if you wanted to theres nothing rong with that
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> If life would not be the same without the person...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> who`s  seth  and  what  did  seth  do??
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> no one can tell you if you are wrong in persuing her becasue everyone is not in your shoes
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> It does get better and you're worth a good relationship!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> 1 If u r really looking for a serious relationship than believe me one is enough.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Sounds kind of weird, but it works.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Nobody will win if you stay with him
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> I already feel like i could tell her anything.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> JUST I WANT TO KNOW THE MEDICINE THATS ALL GUYS
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> preferrably about love and in french with translation
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> talk with him a little, he might just be shy, or scared you would reject him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> but perhaps you have  a complex ...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> anything with nakedness is lust and yes its adultery dont let others say its not its called being deceived
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> I still think about her...sometimes a lot.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> then he called my name, Sugar ?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> n let dat man b happy wit da gal he is wit.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> But note that I said MOST girls & guys and not all.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> I go to his basketball games w/my parents & they don't realy like him.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_45> Go to a park and ride a bike!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Some do......others find it more difficult.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> but yeah your statement is true
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> i am not trying to be racial here.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> dont hide it like you are ashamed.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> I then e-mailed her and asked her to meet up for lunch, she agreed and we had lunch.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> thers a old song out the called love hearts.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> =D Well, good luck and hope this helps!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> He may still love you but I think (especially if hes still young)that he wants to pursue other things.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> My daughter......About 40 i think would be nice.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_15> JUST TAKE EVERYTHING ONE DAY AT A TIME.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> My boyfreind there would be no way i could live without him
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> I mean how do you know it's the right person?
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> then go get more... more .... more
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> enough with the dinner and a movie.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> If it is just that you are single and you're not finding anyone, just give it time.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> You Are a sick, Perverted man.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Sorry, girl, but you're kidding yourself.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> When you see the one you will know it and your mack game will prevail!

<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> that is not fair at all it seems he is just showing off.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> If he's such a nice guy, why don't you give him a chance.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Be a man and tell her ur feelings for her!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> and im the one whos gonna get laid off in a couple months!

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> My boyfriend says im going all the way on the love meter is that good?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> The most romantic thing I´ve done is...take her to a movie...while...I had everything set in my house...i.e.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> OR if he doesnt even show you anymore that he loves you!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> and keep him as if he's the only on this earth

<NbChars_200> <LevSim_35> do you want to or not?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> If he is ok with it then invite the ex.

<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Then hook up with the other dude while he watches.

<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> even though you two are not together.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> You don't want that for the rest of your life.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> even though i took alot of girls virginity away it still took some good makin to do it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Thats when its absolutly the best!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> AND IF THE BOYFRIEND HAVE A RELATIONSHIP AS BUDDIES, IT WILL BE A CHALLENGE TO MAKE RULES.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> I think any girl will mary u if u got some hairs on ur head.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> I tried to do that a while ago, all i got were ingrown hair on my chest, really gross.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> He said he always liked me too and asked me out.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> but after women get married and are together for a while then it goes .

<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> And if he is going to come back to me and still be with me!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> but then I am a gypsy of sorts so I may be roaming the earth some!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> You are not, bad people don't think they are bad, they think they are cool.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Well, start by complimenting her, girls like this.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> She looked at me kind of weird.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> k2_borja@yahoo.com send me email now whats your name?do you have a friendster id?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> go to church there is nice ones there.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> If you haven't seen him, and you don't know his name, then I wouldn't bother.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> YES IT'S NORMAL JUST TAKE SOME TIME AND THINK ABOUT YOUR SELF AND WHY DID YALL SPLIT UP ANYWAY.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Um, well my best friend who is a guy asked me out and I said yes.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> {Att: People who don't believe in divorce - save your breath.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Even women that I asked about his stuff seem to agree ....
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> tell 1 of ur friends 2 tell him or write him a note
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> WOW THATS THE BIGGEST ONE I'VE EVER SEEN!!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> my bestfriend says that beer is the best way
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> because the kids could be transferred between school quarters with very little hassle.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> it might just be a great rush for you too!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> & if this guy is telling the truth, and really cares about you, then you will regret it later.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Well u cant be too young to get married.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> if the relationship was meant to work and you are in love.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> you are writing a good romance novel, but you need a church counsellor to make a good climax
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> But i think you deserve better!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> Try looking into some gay or bi porn
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> see other women, just don't sleep with them
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Ask him if he still loves you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> im at peace after every orgasm!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> my husband thinks my long hair is sexy and a turn on
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> She talked to her, and now we're going out!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> dont select any person from your family.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> its in the middle I have 1
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> Why would you ask strangers, don't you just know you shouldn't do anything.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> !And too bad for you, if you do not change...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> And what if they flirted back with her?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> someday you'll find a guy you find atractive and you should ask him out.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> otherwise they are enjoing other girls.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> may be , u r wrong some where so far u r writing this ?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> I guess it depends on the girl.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> she will see what man was always there for her and which one she really loves.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> THE CHILDREN WILL HAVE TO HAVE SOME TIME JUST TO THEMSELVES (AWAY FROM EACH OTHER).
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> i'd ahve to go w/ KenC's answer
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> if you friend is only 22 she is just starting her life.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> just be your self and a gentleman,
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> ask yourself if you really love him.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> i'm 17,and in love with a guy that is 21 and has a girlfriend my age.

<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> try to bump up here bed time by an hour.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> bad boys have an edge that girls find dangerous, adventerous, fun
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> I am so old that everyone that looks desirable is way too young!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Maybe you do things that bother him too.

<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> Trust me I did on someone!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> people do not break up for no reason.

<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> WRONG ... women are everywhere ... check out David DeAngelo and his double your dating stuff.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> This kid is a spoiled, raging brat!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_10> START IN THE AM WITH GENTLE BRUSHES AND SUBTLE HINTS.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> step towards life love and living
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> ( I used to run track and still maintain great muscle tone)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> to him, your just a filler.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Of course its the best way
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> And you say you like him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> he is like afraid to loose you!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> by the way public, check my question i left for you
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> if your not married to them dump them they probably arent going to change.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> shut and lock your bedroom door.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Sometimes he`ll pick my bra up and put it on and pretend to be me just for fun.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Everything is hard & its more hard if it involes love
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> :) And besides, I've got my eyes on a lotta real people who actually know me.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> I do alot ( a whole lot) of private home wedding,  I love weddings at the beach.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> So how do ya keep it all enteresting?
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> how can i handle all of this?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> MY FIANCEE CHEATED WITH MY BEST FRIEND.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> Don't presure yourself so much!Just be like Hey How are you!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> Why don´t we just go and get some coffee or martini (or both!)
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_35> But I would really think about this.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Like places you often go to.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> IF SO, YOU NEED TO SET SOME RULES FOR YOUR BOYFRIEND.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> You or the partner is too young!!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> Because they really don't love you.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> best of both worlds just dont get caught!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_20> in one TV shows I was surrprised by a 41 years old HOT BABE!!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> she doesn't go to sleep at night?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> ok, that is just weird I am assuming  your younger.....
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> It isn't good for your child to be there either, so get out while you still have your sanity!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> We usually mean more than what we say, so we figure you do too :))
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> this is a really awful thing to do!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> unless you are famous, forget it.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> as TexasCowgurl said a guy who look at the outer not all guys are like that
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> 1 Corinthians 13 That's if you wanna know what love really means!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> it wont be very enjoyable the first time.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> This should please him a lot
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> No do not call his butt.If he still had feelings for you then he would be callin you!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> IT DOESN'T MATTER IF HE WAS OR WASN'T .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> it depends if your friend want or don't want you to have sex with him/her
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> get over it and get on with life
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Seriously, I never knew life could be this great!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Probably... hey, there are plenty of fish in the sea!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> i mean it's just a color.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> but u half to think do u really want to B with this guy.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> i think all girls should have hair.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> Just break up with her, she CHEATED on you!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> in my opinion its perfectly o.k.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> back way off before you lose a best friend.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> I LIKE YOUR HONESTY, BUT DUDE GROW UP.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> in my opinion he has found someone else.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> CREATE SEXUAL TENSION LIKE THEY DO ON FILM AND TV.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> I find that odd that guys spend that much time talking about it, blaming themselves.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> First off, I am fat, so I'm going to say this as bluntly as I can.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> 2ND WHAT WRONG WITH YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Now nothin is left,she is wth him and im left alone.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> whatever she says then you must follow.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> How can a loser ever win?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> She won't stop talking about him and its getting on my nerves!
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_30> Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> are you sure you two are still going out?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> I can turn the lights off for him, you know what I mean?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> IT IS A BATTLE , BUT WHAT DO YOU CHOOSE?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> that is when it would feel like adultry
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> i dont know really this is hard!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> why would you want to chat with turkeys?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> untill then ask quetsions that people, other than me, wil answer.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> Man, did I learn that the hard way....
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> A HOE YA JUST DO IT ON THE BACK OF THE CAR, BUT A LADY SURE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> do you prefer a man that expresses his emotions freely(even crying)?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> just stay friends with them both right now.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Just start kissing her softly on her neck and shoulder.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> tell them Im leaving..........come back later....lol
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> Tell her you have been wondering about dating.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> Trust you are just a kid.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> your child shouldnt grow up in an enviroment like that.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> but it's not normal if in ur age u don't have any single crush.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> Like, let me give you an example.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> why dont you marry with the daughter of your mamoon.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> or does he think I have problem in sex?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> isn't this the wrong category to be asking this question?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> ask you self again do you really love him?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> it felt like eating a lot of chocolates and throwing up after.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> Just say - I LOVE YOU
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> Honey I'm not sure what to tell ya.
<NbChars_255> <LevSim_25> I'm a hair and eye guy.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> yes i have been with him for 12years.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> find something you both like and buy it for her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> heck yes, you would do for me sweetie!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> You just have to pick the right one.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> in your closet with the lights out ?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> but it would be better for you marriage.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> first of all didnt it hurt you when you found out she was cheating on you?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> are the girls like the one from american teen movies.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> they want to skeet on u
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> Uh....no, because re rarely even fart.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> My opinion, take your time, girl!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> if you expect to do good in college.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> depends on who ur with, but this one guy kissed me, and the next thing I knew.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> I told ALL off my friends that I liked him.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> oooo.looks like you jumped in too soon.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> i think everyone is a little nervous there first time having sex.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> Preferbly both but money would probly win
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> first of realize your relation.. and then ask this question again..
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> GET OUT and never look back!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> what ever you do dont try to pressure guys to be more emotional.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> Sounds like some idiots I know.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> second:  since when is a girl asking for $$$ ok???
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> i can imagine but i'm not a girl
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Evertime he talks my heart beats faster!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> that way you guys get to talk and enjoy an afternoon stroll, and you both get to work out.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> loves not easy so dont be so anxious.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> that lazy son of a B***** .
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_10> NOTWITHSTANDING THE RELATIONSHIP WILL STEM FROM THE LOVE AND AFFECTION EVERY WOMAN DESERVES.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> once i had a broken heart, crying all the time, didn't want to do anything.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> just tell them, don't insalt them, but be honest.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> yOU MEAN...WHAT...MORON HOW CAN UR OWN SISTER WANNA HAVE SEX WIT CHA PLEASE GROW UP
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> My husband got his that way.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> Just reading your question upset me!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> 10 months to go hahahaha   1.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Hope this can help to you alot.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> i love to do math it just depends on what subject it`s on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> depends... a dude looking for a wife would prob go to church.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> if she likes him enough that is.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_10> IN THE SCHOOL DAYS I LIKE THE VERY BIG ASS OF MY CLASS TEACHER  I DONT KNOW WHY?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> i dont think its right for him to be doing this.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> dude - don't believe a single word of what these women tell you.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> DON'T RUSH INTO ANYTHING THOUGH, YOU MIGHT END UP AS A JOHN DOE.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> there into guys, you just dont know it and its not cool to show it.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> WHAT CAN I POSSIBLY BE DOING WRONG.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> My bf wants to have sex & of corse we'll use a condom.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Now that he obviously knows, it's between me and him!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> what happened if your boyfriend forget about your b-day do you think he cheaten?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> am sure u too wuld b rotten rite??
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> however he is the type of guy that all the girls want.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Some men are bi-curious, just like some women are.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> (met him through me and my bf)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> I'm not a fan of guys wearing pink
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Just make sure you're not the rebound girl!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> he dosn't deserve you if he acts like he dosn't care, however, have you asked him about it?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> She isn't going to take the news well, no matter how you approach her on it, so just don't.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_50> If you are a Christian then no!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> But life should be made easier by the one you love.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Every time I look into my girlfriend's eyes, I can see the beach.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> the guy before me is a dumbass.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> 2 or 3 times a week
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> ONE, THERE IS NO RESPECT SHOW ON YOU AND YOUR BOYFRIEND.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> although it can go too far.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Get some courage and ask him!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> You are killing your family and friends.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> ok so if it's with another person.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> It was fun to whisper in her ear months later, I saw you nekkid!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Have you tried LISTENING to her?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> you should not stay in a relationship that makes you miserable.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> NOW I WEAR MY ANNIVERSY RING,WEDDING BAND AND THEN MY ENGAGEMENT RING.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> be true to your self always...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> you're not a bad person... it is just being true to your self!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> coz there may be a way to control her.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> sit down and talk with him.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> but he won't call to talk face to face.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> Okay, first off...How old r u?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> and how do i find out?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Because your 10th anniversary has to be super-special anyway.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I know Leo is a good match
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> Things that make both of you feel good!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> if he keeps giving you the eye.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> how to i convince her to come and hang out and spend the nite like everyone else does.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> A lot of girl like guys to be up front:-)
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_25> Once a cheater always a cheater in my book.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> don't stay, u might get emotionally attached and that would hurt u.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> If you don't know if you are ready then YOU ARE NOT READY!!!
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> So your'e saying you're always HORNY!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> it's kinda harsh but it worked for me.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> Keep searching... things that aren't meant to be, wont happen.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> it its not, you can ask is it wrong to be st8?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> and besides look at my pic, im no hunk either
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> I FOUNG OUT WHEN I GOT A $600 CELL PHONE BILL.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> love and hate...but really Love my friend
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> can u wait until he wants?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> I hope you could find some good friends here, but always keep your eyes open ;)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> If you don't trust her, that means you probably aren't doing your job in the bedroom.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_30> if you want to, then do it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> I still think he's cute, i just don't like him.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> Get your nails done or something.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> i m 18yrs n wanna good caring n loving boyfriend or life partner
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> then it is meant to be .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> im just looking for a friend...some one that i can talk too!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> He says he still wants to be able to have sex but I told him no.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> I love him but I can't continue like this!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> ya i think  should just wait for the right guy to come along
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> dont hang up on the relationship , you dont know how lucky you are in this world .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> ignore him and dont annoy yourself to think about him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> after they get married the chop off their beautiful hair and gain 50 lbs.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> you are a pleaser, a helper, and maybe a martyr.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> You loved this guy and he messed you up.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> they are just more unashamed and freely talking about it
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> but not anymore with my bad boy *hehehe*
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> and you know for sure you can't avoid the fight.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> weed or no weed, he is a LIAR!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> but be careful love can also break your heart.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_35> no its not wrong age aint nothin but a number
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> you are SO sweet, and i dont even know you!!!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> the answer depends on how long u've been 2gether.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> Or you just like looking like a sap.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> is it ok or is it considered cheating
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> So he's a liar and definitely not the One.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Move on and don't look back.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> Because girls in general are golddiggers.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> as a man you are not supposed to hit any woman.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> but remember if he is being a good father let him be the father.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Jesus hates pornography, but he hates people who look at it even more!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Because my boyfriend is too jealous and he won't let me go anywhere alone umless is my mom!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> give him a general valentine see how he responds.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> I can hear myself think now.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> because you hope they'll do the same for you (do they?)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> BOTH OF YOU HAVE ALREADY MADE FAMILIES AND THINK THAT EVERYTHING WILL BE LIKE THE BRADY BUNCH.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> all girls could be sexy in way way or another
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_10> A CHILD MOLESTER DOES NOT DESERVE ANYTHING WHAT HE DOES DESERVE IS TO GET HIS DICK CUT OFF!!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Ok first of all why would you take a child to visit a child molestor?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> is it on your best friend's body , or his girlfriend's?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> infact i like the people here,they are hardworking and friendly.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> But a MAN cries and you're like...whoa.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> at least this girl is honest.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> slowly you guys will become friends again.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> throw in a couple of restraurant meals (about US$15 - ????...)...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> ACTUALLY I AM FOUND OF BIG ASS FROM MY CHILD HOOD.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> its turn on  men like it simple
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Take care and don't worry, this IS fixable.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> if ur married, & hes married, u both want to be together?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> this is the best thing that could have happened to her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> has nothing to do with it
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Then get the papers and ask her to sign them!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If he's honest and says he loves you go with it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> if you are not married yet  the answer should all be I have not...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> honestly, men and women say that they need time, but its almost always for another person.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> i am agree with travis 2005
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> so if his ur friend dont do anything that will ruin ur friends relationship
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> 4) If u r tensed, don't shout at ur spouse.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> You just don't see that now because you're grieving.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> I never kissed her and ask her once how did she feel about sex.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> so he can always take his balls and go home when hes tired of playing
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> My boyfriend and I just started dating.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> instead of wondering just ask whats the worst he could say to you no
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> Just relax u can find girls all over the place.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_20> THE GOOD OR THE BAD OF IT?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> I don't think so, but it is worth a try/
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> 5) Go out once in a while with ur spouse.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> He finally asked me out and said soon he's gonna brake up with her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> i guess i could say yes.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> kick em in the ribs then smash their head on a wall.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> just wanted info on tis topic
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> She is 14 and shes starting to really cause serious problems with her dad and I!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> is cute when the guys wearing pink
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> you can love them, but they might not in return
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> :)  I wouldn't worry about the average.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> IS THERE ANY PROBLEM WITH ME?
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_45> if no change, it's time to get rid of her
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> i mean you dont have to leave her, just warn.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> I didn't have it, as i didnt get married yet..and in Islam,, sex is only allowed for married couples..:))
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> i have called him twice since then.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> Read my lips : You`re a MORON
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> why we say it?why we fall into it?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> I think he is playing with you so fix this with his way and Im sure that will work
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Some guys look better in pink than some women!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> but first, u have to be happy too!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> So i'm worried he might have changed his mind about wanting to still be with me!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> we have found so much more 2 get upset about than age!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Can't have it all unless they both still love him and are willing to share.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> Instead of, Gee, I suck at finding a good man!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> So what you have a crush on this guy.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> no, they know its not proper-ladylike ya know?.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> They do it just as the rest of the people who live in other countries!!
<NbChars_300> <LevSim_20> Im always too hot to too cold.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_25> even if she says no, the friendship remains
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> 2.Go to the park and have lunch!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Definitely not wrong if you're a chick!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> go with him but keep it clean and no sex
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Don't try to be a perfect person because no one is (not even the Canadian girl)lol!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> funny acualy they don't fart untill they are married because they havn't got an a**** yet
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Tell him no and give him an ultimatum, but be ready to walk if he chooses her over you.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> what ever you do , do go slow and have fun warming up first.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> its all in the eye contact.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> he didn't say  the he was.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> no way, you are stuck with it for life.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Man, just tell her and If its ment to be then it will be..........
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> ask her on the face u need not fear if she says a yes or a no
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> I guess inbetween would be best
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_50> Why dont men invest in their wives appearence?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> to answer your question what is love.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> everything is not and hopefully never will be on age!!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> Which is great, since women, like men, should be taught to love (and respect!)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> Some girls like to be kissed down there, some just want to kiss, depends.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> if u dont love her, turn her down.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Should be JP right there where you can get your license.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> but she hits and beats me so hard that i have to defend myself and end up hitting her.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> love... is a think worth running all life after and die for/from...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> (You should see them before hand) Ughhhh!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> you stop going out with him because he is using you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> get some strange, but be safe.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Life is short, don't sweat the small stuff!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> I am sure he likes u too !
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> and if i do love him , how do i make a move?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> blue eyed blonde who cleans, cooks and makes your meals day in and day put without complaining about it...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> i asked  can i tickle your feather?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> !I would love some bf advice!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Yeah I do luv her  a lot...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> you are young it's puppy love.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> if he doesnt want to be with you, why be with him?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> no is not wrong and i think is cool
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> if you are not comfortable then leave or tell them that you have errins to run.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> She was probably looking for a brother like relationship then sensed you were getting the wrong idea and split.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> Don't waste your time with this guy.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> Good Luck I know it is not easy.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> in case you haven't heard, guys aren't that good at getting a hint and picking up on soft clues.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> A lot of good men are out there.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> My life with my husband was a living hell, but I stayed because I said I DO!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> You'll just have to move on now I guess.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> most guys just want sex but some look for romance and love
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> if you and him don't mind about that small age difference then don't care about what people say.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> I have a daughter named Bethany!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> I'm a junior now (he's a senior) and he still likes me.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_30> lol, that happens to me ALOT 2
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> Last week she invited me to her birthday with her family, I went.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> well, she obviously likes u, but u need to wait awhile to get her to open up
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHEN TO SAY IT'S ENOUGH.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> yes but only a freind and on the messenger only ok im danitza753 16/f/ca on yahoo messenger
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Your messin with the wrong type of guys.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> YOUR A BETTER PERSON THAN WONDERING IF'S .
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> Dont let him see it coming, though.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Remember, mostly it's if you love them!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> isn't that cute he leave his socks all over the floor .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> I want an HONEST answer from those guys who know what im talking about.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> I don't know man but that sound pretty scary.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> to the extent i could die for the one i love.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> pick up your sox and give her control of the remote control!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> if it is the same person.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> why of course...packing my suitcase now.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> They ask so much question but all they want is a good conversation...  =) Cheers
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> make up but you wont get away with it
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> but what i really think that they should put to death just like a murderer
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> it depends.. some guys can carry them some don't
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> IM me at roguefire28 on yahoo messenger.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> id never forgive myself if i said that to some one.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Don't worry about it too much.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> a trailer dweller may like a gal who spits that chew far.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> No i wouldnt because if you aint got no feelings for that person it just wouldnt seem right.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> knowing the partner will be there when you wake up!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> he's young as r u not really sure if your the one just yet.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Find another boyfriend, become a nun, anything but this!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> that way, you get something as well ;)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> and my boyfriend gave me two!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> And when your around her just think of the thing you like most about her!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> you can not read an answer to find that ifo out you have to ask her that  question.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Im warning only too those's who lie.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> can someone tell how there are true people on yahoo and if there true how can you be sure
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> you know the usual cheating feeling.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> for the sake of your child.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> love the girl for who she is, not what her hair is like.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> sure do love to collect friends!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> THIS GUY HAS ALOT OF FRIENDS WHO ARE GIRLS.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> my guy broke up with me over the phone fri.  i need to talk to him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> if you have money $40 to spare then goto a motel or ask a friend for his/her room.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> That big spot between her ears.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> if you want to...do it yourself.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> let her do what she needs to do and then she'll cool out and so will you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> are u trying to be cute and funny?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> No need to rush - really...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> but it took me 6 months to figure it out.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> he may not be ready for a relation ship but he shouldn't be treating u that way also.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> it's called ATTRACTION .. bad boys use it most without knowing
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> I will not let someone run me out of my own house.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Even if he's hooking up for money people don't seem so concerned with it.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_20> Once a week,  if your lucky...........
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> She needs to realize that you care about her health too and not just her looks.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_45> why make her fall in love with you??
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> first: asking for sex is like... weird.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> may be because we are unable to understand it
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Stick aroung for more crap, or finish it off for real?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> It looks like your batting {empty set} right now...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> If she is a smart girl she can convince the guy to wait
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> So in return I feel like it gets cut short alot of times.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> there is no sexier site than this!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> You said you love her so you should stay.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> Hi there .....  U should always think that sex is created 4 expressing love beyond talk and hag.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> idont use fake pictures or fake descriptions.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Well...get to know her a bit.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> to quote jay-z's song ladies is  pimps to go on and brush ya shoulder off
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_65> learn yourself, your needs and what you want in a person.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> and since the house was in my name only .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> THE SAME WILL HAPPEN FOR YOUR DAUGHTER AND YOUR BOYFRIEND,.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> When you push, like in flirting, you attract the wrong kind of guy.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> he tells me he got the email.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> sometimes its love and sometimes there using them because they just want to have it!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> who knows what city folk like!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> i not pretty sure what love is so that why i'm asking.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> it's not that tough and it could actually help your relationship.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> Most beautiful girl ive ever seen.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> i dont think so,its actually something you can do with your spouse
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> otherwise send her to her friends house.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> once u truly love a person, u'll feel it inside u that u need to protect that somebody.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Cept the girl was in my english class, not science.
<NbChars_285> <LevSim_25> And I'm not fat either- 5'2 110 lbs
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> My fav body part is my 38D boobs.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> a man will say, he has the best of both worlds.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> I really like this guy but i don't even know if he nows im real??
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> But dont call him then it will seem like your lonely!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> if he's shallow and maybe slightly rude, u can know 4 sure that he's only looking for good looks.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> watch them secretly you will find a guy who realy loves you....  best wishes nick jishnu_vv@yahoo.com
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> You win some and you lose some.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Your bf should be the one to tell her that it's just not gonna happen.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> But don't worry if you keep looking you'll find it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> make him jealous, do the things he does to u...and have fun!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> i am attracted to bigger women, but when you think about it all women are sexy to someone
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> the lieing part is worse than the weed smoking(in a relationship)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> My dear, you are only 18 years old!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> in my opinion once a cheater always a cheater.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> tell her that shes just not the one for u
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> All of us girls want the best guy possible!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> God just shows u way if u belive in that.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> Now to a straight guy it's probably getting together and hanging out, going to party, and stuff like that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> HE WOULD STILL BE THWERE IF HE WAS.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> don't shave your chest, its a waste of time.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> Don't jump before learning how to walk !
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> kid,just concentrate on study first to avoid too much drama and heartaches,lolz!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> you might find a new avenue for fun and spice up your love life all at the same time!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> oh well, tell her if mom can join too.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_70> But never taken time off to see me.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Well right me to see how it  goes!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> In life, If your good at math, your bad at english.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i wish i had a brother as nice as you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> its depend on guys but i want she's cute,sexy,beautiful eyes,long hairs,smile and looking innocent.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You shouldn't feel bad ourselves remeber thisFool me once shame on you but fool twice shame on me
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> she brings my friends and co workers in the problem, i just need some help.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> Sure I get called a B@#$!
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_40> His passion for life and the Lord!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_20> I KNOW I AM NOT THE HOTTEST THING.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> What if gals wear men's undergarments?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> And that would be a huge problem.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> makes for a good ice breaker.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> If its male/male u may wanna sink a bottle of JD first!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> just because they know french and english?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Respect means dont flirt in front of her and never forget shes your one and only love.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> You are a jerk on the real.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> boys are bad with dates in general .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> although some people say it just to say it.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> as a guy i can tell you he loves you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> If you got a kid, your life never will be as you dream of ...not now, never!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> yeah sweetie you guys really dont pay attention to details.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Only if you think he really likes you!!!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> some ppl would like to know
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> i would say that it was bad because he said that YOU were the one goin over.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> I think it's because women believe they don't deserve any better, and that is sad!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> He probably isn't cheating, he's probably just stupid (like me).
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> =] Anyway, I've heard enough guys say horrible things about big-bellyed women.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> You wanna kiss someone you really love.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> its always a bad idea to have a relationship at work
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> e-mail or fax her: Dear /name/!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> go out on a date with someone!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> demonstrate how much fun and better it would be for her if you were her man.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> (try asking for his # or offering him yours.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_10> girl...u shouldnt even need advice for this answer.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> OK, I'M THINKING YOU'RE SINGLE SO THIS IS WHAT YOU CAN DO.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> Not sure if I believe in destiny or not
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> Just smile and tell him/her ya not interested.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> 550-894, well do you think you deserve it ?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> i mean how can anyone now you better then a friend.

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> ur not gonna have a problem with new culture, ur gonna like it...try and see
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> start by simply asking the person.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> I dont think u lost ur guts.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_15> MAKE IT LAST A FEW DAYS, IF NECCESSARY.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Then, when you're not looking...the right one will come along!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> I am right here, but im married sorry lol
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> be confident and tell her you'll be the best boyfriend she'll ever have.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> chatting in internet is become comman things.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> My husband has become the man I married!!!!!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> I have told here that I want to hang out outside work but whatever I do we never do.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> i mean show to him a good atittude!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> if he was abusive, you shouldn't get jealous and you should just move on.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> its not a disease you could catch or anything.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> Hey,    Well you I know you've probly already heard this but just be yourself!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> i like plump women cause they arent shaped like a guy and are all curvy and hippy.

<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> tell  him  to  go to the  local  strip club

<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> I don't think that's such a bad thing but my friends want me to get over him.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> she just broke up with him like 2-3 days ago.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> Apparently, he's playing you, so don't fall for that one!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> if your married go find a counselor becasue living with a cheeter is very hard.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> No kidding, she really is over there >>>>>>
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> I think she afraid to leave him.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> it doesn't have to be expensive just do things that she likes all week, but don't tell her!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> they don't want to hurt your feelings
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> UM..........  ok, you seriously need to talk to this guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Hi, my name is _________ .
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> two positives gives you no television to watch gay guys bumping nasties.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> If you don't, you won't know what your missing.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> well, ask her out; ya never know unti lyou try.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> i suggest you could wait for it to go or place a make-up on it hahaha!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> If she doesn't want to sign them, then she needs to get her shit together!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> dont feel bad ive been with mine for 3 years and he forgets every year
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> i think he likes u but afraid to start relationhsip.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> I couldn't do it becaus eI'm shy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> I say to both of you...Congradulations!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Unless it's someone disgustingly wealthy - like Bill Gates.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_35> Finally give yourself time to heal.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> she is not the first women to tell me that
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> My b/f and i just recently had a baby and i have 3 others.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> so my point is that it's kinda true what you said.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> what kind of hints do guys give girls when they are cheating?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> The man is an idiot, because he wants his cake and eat it too.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_35> i don't blog or use myspace, but the people i know that do are all full of cr*p.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> If you really love him then I would when alone stroke his penis.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> never heard of friendster... i have myspace n xanga
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> just last week my boyfreind and some buddies left out of town for a project at work.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> lol that would be so pimp.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> oh yes it reallt works go for it
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> if he can't trust you to go out and see friends, then you should break up with him.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> He said he broke up with her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> he might not only like you as a friend, but he might like you more!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> does not condone it, then love away.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> 360º) and we're together for one year.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> one on each side, lol, we were really going at it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> you two would just be fine ... dont worry about it buddy .
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> so don't see the person shortcomings or faults .
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Not wanting kids to not have a father.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> The fact that you are asking Yahoo!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> I say that because most people don't get married then fall in love.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I don't want things between me and her to get lost.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> Because guys want what they can't have.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> And he wants to look around.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> They stop callin as much he stops callin u by ur nick name?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> But if hunk kind or extra smart kind probably a bit of over enthusiasm and ofcourse lies :D
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> if you enjoy munching on the carpet knock yourself out
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> I know how it is the little girl might don't want you around her and her dad.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> and he can do what he wants and its all good.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> talk to her ask her out pick her up un exspected
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> WELL THATS A HARD ONE IDD KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD DO.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Just go n tell him upfront.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> RUSSIAN AND MOST FOREIGN WOMEN ARE GENERALLY GREAT COMPANIONS, ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE RESCUED FROM A HARSH ENVIRONMENT.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> I feel like Dear Abby so just listen to that and you will not be screwed.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> my daughter i couldnt live with out her!
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_40> The funny thing is: my actual girlfriend found me on the web (community websites like Yahoo!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> Think about it, you see a woman crying and its no biggie.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> Get a porno movie and do everything they do.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> im interested, but im not pretty...Ü
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_55> give it to him so atleast heknows u like him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> I realy like a guy but i don wana tell him coz he is goin out with someone else.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> well...not for me,and idk what to do.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> but will she love you back is the question...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> but if you try real hard you get what you need
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Again if it has to do with a guy?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> she seems to think that i never let her say what she wants.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_30> She looks at me with this evil grin and walks off!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> no, i've done it before in the past.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> maybe if you listen, and let her talk, things will get better.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> fall in love first.. sex will be automatic
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> I was like you, i like her from de begining but thigs didn't happen at first.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> He doesn't freak with u no more?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> i love him ALOT and my boobish friends are SO STUPID and accually left me + him alone together!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> you dont have to do anything that you dont want to do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> but keep it slow and simple.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> use words like imagine, what if, dream, and vision.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> When its on a fella dat can pull it off its great!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> it's because you're attacted to the wrong type of guys.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Most of the girls I know don't blame the guy like that unless he cheated on her or something.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_45> Because most men dump you after two days!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> If not, best of luck to you in your education!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> many teens begin their sexual life at this age, youger is worser, older is worser :)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> go to yahoo messenger chat room... look for turkey n join it.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> yeah nobody knows who seth is.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> he is not me thats why
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> simply have courage, tell him again about ur love that u r thinking to make ur relationship deeper.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> He will either show up later on or he wont.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_20> Magic 8 Ball says, Ask again later
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> well i suggest giving it a shot, come on over i'll help yah figure it out!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> GET OFF YOUR  BUM     AND ASK THEM STRAIGHT OUT.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> is it they want a relation or just ***.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> What the sense of saying it everyday if in reality you didn't mean it?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Dang don't do that, evidence will be splattered all over the damn place!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Hope you find the one that makes you smile.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> sometimes it takes a bit of time to meet the right guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> Must be all in my head, you think?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Then flirt with every good looking guy u meet.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> This way, I try not to hurt her
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> do handsome men consider dating women their own age?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> that's the funny thing about love!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Just a few things to think about
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> gosh u are supposed to have children soon.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_10> THEN FILL THE TUB WITH SPAM AND JUMP IN...WHEN YOUR MATE GETS HOME.....LOL
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> that would be your wife or your husband (depends on your sex)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> he'll be worrying wat happened to u?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> next time...tell him to give ya a hicky somewhere that your mom won't see it (wink wink)

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> i think u should be straightforward... tell him how u feel...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> There are kind women out there that are just not interested.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> are you closer with one of them?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> no you aren't the only person that feels this way.

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> has this ever happened to anyone else?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> Most guys don't really care if you have a little bit but don't get carried away.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> we broke up again and are now just friends.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> when it goes beyond your limits
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> and think me as frnd  need to discuss anthing just  put a mail at  pleasent_kamal@yahoo.com.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> if he asks just tell him yes.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> Your answer should be the same.......NO!!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> u r right, but once she had a relationship with him then she will regret.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> Well it depends what kinda stuff, you werent very specific about that.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> i don't think so, unless you eat twinkies while you are doing it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> that person always will always notice you
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> HIS REPLY WILL BE THAT HE YOU ARE NOT HIS MOTHER.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> You know what to do agent21257
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> no breathing no moving no thinking no living  anything i'm missing?
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> for me  when i say love you.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> if ur bf cares for u, he will go slow and make sure ur not in pain.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> it takes longer to go up than it does to go down
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> But i guess you would just feel it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> if she had a boyfriend when u wer broke up ....don't do it....it will hapen again :(...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> how could some one fell in love.

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> yes it will hurt a lil, mostly ull just feel pressure.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> this is the most naive question I ever heard from anybody........ASK HER......shis.....
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> The ones i saw on there were gorgeous tho!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> why would you want to her orgasm quickly, take your time with her and she will enjoy it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Thats the deal the stump gets.......
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> you both dicsuus this with your spouses , and get married, better u advice ur spouses to get married
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> mini carrots, super healthy and very clean
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> ok, i really like this guy.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> if my vital tool is only less than 15cm?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> May I ask what yours is?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> no because boys i no dont like girls goning there
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> A QUESTION WITH A QUESTION WHERE ELSE WOULD YOU TAKE A LADY?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> white gauzy material over a 4 poster bed and lots of pillows.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> I can't give a straight yes or no.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> she feels no else will want her
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> In the meantime, just be happy and have fun in high school!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> it doesn't sound like it is serious.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> Hugs & Kisses,  the same way i do.. :)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> every women has a great part you just need to find it!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> i try to be as truthful as i can.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I think it's too young for u to make it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> maybe she feels she needs ypur money.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> stockings with the seam in the back, sexy conservative is very hot
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> never ever go in 2 a relationship if it seems 2 good 2 b true!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> not yet still waiting for the right guy
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_5> BUT I THINK ACTION SPEAKS BETTER THAN WORDS
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_45> by leaving him/er alone for sometime...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> You need to ask that person...again if you cant trust why would you marry?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> my friend goes from guy to guy weekly!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> get U'r satisfaction that way Ok.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> clean shaven if you have a six pack, or if you just arent fat.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> i think in in love with this guy, but i dont know for sure.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Yes you can is she doesn't have a boy friend.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> You run up the heat.You da man.Tell her dat she jus gon' have to walk round naked.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> It's more than obviously shown..... but they still won't say it!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> I AM NOW IN A NEW RELATIONSHIP AND I AM AFRAID OF THE SAME THING AGAIN.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> wait until 24, 19 is too soon.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> This will cause disturbances between u & ur spouse.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> It's tough but you need to move on.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Give it up and let it go.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> So long as you are a good person, who cares if you are gay or straight?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> run if she cant say no to the kids what does that say about her?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> you said you love her so completely.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> A Big mac costs about US$2.00 here?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> like myself, i am a closeted bi- male.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> But don't latch on to just anyone.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> i'm not making fun of the question.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> who is 30, never married, of indian origion and looking for LIFE-PARTNER....????
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> Right now sounds good to me
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> How would you feel if she went around flirting with other men?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> when its all you think about!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> if her man come after you and you can't divert it at all cost.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> sorry but i don't think it would work out between us would be good.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> If you do give him your #.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> well, i'm 30 and so of course i have an opinion on this.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Because most bad boys put up pretences and lie a lot and unfurtunately girls love such.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> But your 2 young hes young.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> but she wouldn't leave the house .
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> do you really know what love is .
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> If a woman knows you are maried chances are she is not comfortable wit you flirting with her.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Yes, I was married to him, didn't like him..and still had sex with him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> who think heavy-set latinas with brunette, long hair are sexy?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Women sooo don't work that way.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> i think hes not because he married kim
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> all he wants me to do all the time is change to what he wants.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> It can do if you want it to.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_10> THE ONLY THING THAT I CAN TELL YOU TO DO IS PUT IT BEHIND YOU AND FOCUS ON SCHOOL.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> do you know him at all?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> I pretty much had it with this guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> he said that he wants to have group sex with his friend and his friend is a guy!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Spank him for being a badboy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> how would it like to be dead?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> Tell him straight out...honesty is best :)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> and while they are on the ground.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> and if you gain weight even after the first time?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> If your asking suck a stupid question.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_20> alot of things it might be.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> It depends on if you are a guy or a girl.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> base on experience: LEO, LIBRA, Aquarius, Aries and GEMINI  other thn tt: DONT
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> As they say on Oprah...she needs to drop that zero and get herself a hero.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> i dont think we are hiding.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> Even though you should not be asking that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> it will become ur last date
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> but i know what my favorite part is!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> How can I tell if a guy is obsessed with me?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> You think of some one else besides your wife don't you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Even if its the molestors own child.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> Should I go for the guy I like best or the one who likes me best???
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> My bedroom, a hotel room seems a little horish like she's not worth my time
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> just act like you never informed anyone... lolz
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> you probably need to listen to her!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> no way hoze ask me y at xxjudychepxx@yahoo.com
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Does he play with you like your a friend or is he flirting with you?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> if they don't, don't bother with them
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> you just need to use your imagination!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> take  some  time  alone  to  see if  you   guys   are  really   for each   other
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> And he says he loves me too.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> so dont keep ur tongue to urself... lol
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> If you like it then why not!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Or if ou are 2 nervous see if you guys could play some 1 on 1 sometime.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> When I can let it all go is when its AWESOME.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> but we have usually 1 times/day & in weekend we have 2 or 3 times/day
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> pinch him real hard and pinch the day before your next birthday.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> tell your sis to do something for u. and get rid of ur friend.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> because it's fun, and it's rewarding too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> just call me at my cell fone and lets have a spring wedding, ok?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> Be yourself and if they don't like it than f**k them!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> You are both adults already..... so I guess the question would be..... WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU???????
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> and u will most likely bleed a lil, but u will be fine, it gets better.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> if u dont mind my asking.. U just havent met d right 1..
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> just go out and have fun, get a free dinner, and if n e thing happens, good.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> have a talk and give them the first 5-10 minutes to talk.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> let her feel that you care for her feelings,for us is very important you have no idea!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> or maybe you just act like you are.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> it is very good now u found ur best friend and u will be friends for ever
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> you should keep liking him because you never no he might ask you out
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> generally the same thing as you
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> THATS WHATS MESSED UP ABOUT YOUR QUESTION.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> you don't know what kind of crazies are out there!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> !good luck I hope it works out for ya
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> wen the other have noting else to say to prove his point then u win ..
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> you find ways to support ur argument
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> FOR THAT I ADVISE A SIMPLE ANSWER WHICH NO ONE LIKE ...MAKE UR GF AS UR LIFE PARTNER
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> sorry didn't mean to ask so many questions in my answer, just consider them retorical.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> you have to wonder about how much he really cares.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Everything about them, I personally like and prefer the waist, stomach and the behind goodness... oh!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> when you make the difference between infatuation and true love not just lust!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> i got jealous, also when my ex boyfriend started going out with my friend.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> There's more to life than that kinda stuff...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> You just have to do it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> meaning that your television or your radio wont play without a negative and a positive.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> then come back a lot later.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> dude, stay the heck away from this girl man....wow.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> i had a guy who would always make me horny and then i'd be ready, but he'd chicken out
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> A lot of guys love girls with curves.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> But he is getting married this month.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> guyz with beard, guyz with mustashe, or guyz who shave their facial hair?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> First off, don't try and be something your not, you've got something to offer, remeber that.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> go to college but keep in touch breaks weekends the telephone internet hun get your education!
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_20> It didn't cost even $100 total.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_25> flip a coin see whats best to do...
<NbChars_250> <LevSim_20> Then if you feel a spark ASK HER OUT~JUST YOU TWO!!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_20> because bad boys are frickin hot, sexyful, adventurous, and VERY VERY FUN and i love mine sooo much!!!
<NbChars_295> <LevSim_25> Why u spoil a women life.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> And still looking tired of even thinking about dating.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Sounds to me like you are a comfortable pit stop!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> Any girl with big tits is sexy
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_10> UNLESS YOU'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL OR YOUNGER, THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> oh and i dont work so that is out for making him leave.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> or eyeball chat so we can see each other
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> Don't wait until she's dragged you through the mud!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> HOWEVER----i find him looking at me every now and then.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_15> IN MY LAST RELATIONSHIP I WAS CHEATED ON.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_15> JERRY JERRY JERRY BEAT HIS A$$
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> n plz thnk abt ur man-- am sure u dnt wanna hurt him too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> and i just came to terms with that myself.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> if you like him give it to him
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> SO SWEAT THE SMALL STUFF AND BE THE BIGGER PERSON IN THE SITUATION.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Comes home when ever he wants.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> you can download it from the website below :)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> kiss him it will tell everything

<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> it doesent matter if a person is gay or st8 that dosnt difine them.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> if he is in a position of authority, it can be a great release for him!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> Have fun, be safe, and keep looking!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> I even thought of sending her photos to the magazine,MAXIM
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> they have really bad memory when it comes to dates.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> Perhaps she thinks she won't find someone else.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> you might want to try this: try just ignoring him for a day and talk nicely the next.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> check out the site history on the computer
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Give him some ***** I'm pretty sure he'll appriciate it.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> Thats what woman do in there!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> YES, I love big round butts....
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> Get your boyfriend to go a little lower next time!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> u have to take a risk *who dares?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> take me to a consert like from 1 of my fav bands...  somethin low key i hate high maintnace.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> depends on how he does it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Guys, when they in the mood, kinda like take off your pants and let's go!.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> When you are ready to move on lots of good people are out there (okay, some weird ones, too!).
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> a fire under  my  azz  makes  me really  hot
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> well girl if you have 5 guys all interested in you, you should be flattered, and proud.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> you can't help them, they need to help themselves.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> she is my sister's best friend and she likes one of my friends.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> yeah i'll talk with ya email me uncontrollablelegend@yahoo.com
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> but could think like a girl like that if nessary to help with gift chosing.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> risks are hard but, you have to try.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> If you mean go out, NO.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> And have a follow up talk with this same person later.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> life is how you make it let the boys drule on you
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> I mean, you love him sure, but thats a lot to commit to for the next 80 years.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> My family & friends say if I think it, it comes out my mouth!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> it doesnt hurt if the guy doesnt stick IT in hard
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> the chick is probably lying to you, cheating on you, and worst, probably don't exist.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> eventually he will get caught start saving your own money now.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> Well, find someone that you don't see over the net.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> (you were talking about that kind of balls right?)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> that's how i got my girlfriend (and we've been together for 4 years now).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> dont do anything or have any relationship becuse as we people say bros before hoes.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> that was so geeky.... but seriously be safe!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> but worn a little at a time like a pink dress shirt with some jeans...yeah, that looks good!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> but making her to luv u isn't always possible..:)
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> Guys and girls think differently..but you already knew that.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Just play around with it - you'll figure it out.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> You can't help who you love.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> has any one come up with creative idea's for renewing your marrital relationship?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> i don't see anything wrong with it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> dont waste your time with that one.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> Think back to some of the things that got both of you going in the first place.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> this is not a true question, is it ?!!!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> you'r not only lazy but also an idiot.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> or, i want to be more close to u than we r now.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> I think I can help you!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> You don't want it to end like that.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> If she says no, that is her desicion and dont push the safety zone.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> It is not about her mom , it is between you two .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> hmmm....   met him already but not sure, if we really are meant to be... lolz.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_70> when you cant stop thinking of him/her.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> it could but most likely no, because your young and so is he.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> Dont run and tell him you love him.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> PLZ PLZ help a sistah out!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> see i like this guy but i think this girl is really cool
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> if this man is good in bed he will satisfy you in other ways.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> its called insist ummm no, you're thinking of incest, and thats only if you're related, not a friends cousin...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> forget him become my boyfriend and i promise i will never break up with you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> try to move on it is hard but it would be harder if you do not move on.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_25> No haters about this question now...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> so you can read our answers but nothing else.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Sounds foolish, but works like a dream.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> well, it is in no way wrong.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> Badboys are edgy, they are not boring(not that many good guys are).
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> like when they deck out in all pink....ok, that's just gay.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> First date - All the way.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> your eyes can say more than your words ever could.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> You sound like an idiot,  you should do nothing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> Your bf should be the on telling her.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> Just walk up to her and tell her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> dont forget to video tape it if you do.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> Instead of interupting her all of the time????
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> i just believe that guys can have sex even with a cow(literally)
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_25> I mean, on or off the thing, u'r not hotter, dude.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> theres nothing wrong its just dont flirt talk share intrest date dont just excpect to get someone that fast
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> but in privacy of home or in a park-let 'er rip!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> and you shouldnt have to put up with it either.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> or looks but at times these are important too!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> you should expect the best of yourself .
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> no every one is different u cant help how u are thats just the way it is!!!!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> by meeting someone else - someone better hopefully.....

<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> i realy don`t care... if i wanna wear it i just wear it, no matter what color will be.

<NbChars_205> <LevSim_40> marry him just playin just hold on to him
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> If you find one.....let me know if she has a sister.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> i think you should be up on your toes and keep a good watch on this guy.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Telling someone you love them will never sound desperate if you really mean it.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> It's been like this for almost 1 year.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> I hate girl's that lie, and if your one of them im deleting it off!
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_45> It's just a serious thing so.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> maybe a leather outfit and a soft whip?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> One thing, don't have a friend do it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> girl please dont be dumb and dont listen to the first couple hoes above.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> but righ now he is confused.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> Basically, I'm afraid to move on.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> people break up for a lot of different reasone.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> no that is just sooooooo wrong...sorry
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> i heard the girl on cheaper by the doson say that the guy had one of thier 12 kids
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> n im only in 8th grade.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_55> So ronely... so ronely and brue...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> I HAVE COMPLETELY FALLING FOR THIS GUY I WOULD DO ANYTHING TO HELP HIM REACH HIS HIGHEST POTENTIAL.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> WE HAVE BEEN TALKING FOR ABOUT 2 MO.AND WE BOTH I CARE FOR HER.SHOULD I BRING HER OVER?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> coz its also like saying going beyond the extra mile.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> agree with the woman in the pink
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> not only her, but you and your children will too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> i just go ahead and ask him out
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> do you have a cell phone?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> YOU JUST HAVE TO TELL THEM THAT YOU LIKE THEM ANDSOME WILL DUMP YOU AND SOME WILL NOT.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> I like her but i dont no if she likes me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> and when u call him u only talk 4 a few minutes?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> You can look but you can't touch!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> There are so many guys out there.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> thats why someone came with self pleasure  lol
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Ask him out, kiss his cheek, instead of a hand shake give him a hug, ect.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> And i don't just mean dirty things!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> you gotta tell him to back off.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> for one thing shes popular, pretty, and taller than me.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> She has to be a Christian.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> bt if u r satisfied thn all i wuld say is greed is really bad
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> I pick it up and just stare at it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Don't say , Its not you, its me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> dude, what you said made absolutely no sense.....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> if there is grass on the field, it is time to play ball
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> But I say do whatever you think looks best.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> dont act like you want but try to get him to like you
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> or ,that we dont wanna lose him so we say it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Get every guy something that they will like.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> Hmm...cold hard cash is nice, but if they ain't got the looks, they might as well keep moving on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> does she sleep with you guys??
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> leave because he obviously isnt taking the relationship seriously so why should you
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> she dumped him a week ago.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> I want an HONEST answer from those guys who know what im talking about.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> dont tell him, well i wouldnt, and if he likes you then he should tell you!!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> how could i fell in love.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Don't you have family, girlfriends, any hobbies like working out or movies or volunteering or anything!?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> me and my bf have been going out for 3 months and i know he really likes me.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> only if the man is not wearing granny-pants,to saggy in the back
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> go for it age is just a number
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Try asking her to go n c a movie together.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> even the greater ppl we love the die and we go on.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> 1) get rid of everything reminding urself of her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> I used to go shopping alot at the grocery store.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Well there is no real way to do this.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Maybe he's not really bi - he just prefers guys to you :)
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> both of you have to decide.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> once caught they never ever should be back on the streets again.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> but theres just too much drama...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> now seems like he only pays good attention to me in bed - That would be your problem.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> well i am a girl with very long hair.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Sure it is nice to wake up to a massage, but come on!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> personally i dont believe in being gay,lezbein or bisexual.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> Like  I have a problem..........or I'm upset that.....& don't interupt until the other person is finished...It works.. try it
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> tell them, it's a dating service, there's lots more people in the service other than you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> than an average looking guy who looks clean and tidy and dressed well?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> What if she's the worst ever in bed when the time finally comes?!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> -- What did he learn from his divorce?
<NbChars_310> <LevSim_25> I would do IT with IT...
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> Ask him if you can both get promise rings.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Be a STRONG black man and suck it up.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Don't rush, get to know each guy better and then choose the one you think is best for you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> try to sleep with the waiter.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> it's just as hard to find the right boy!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> my ex cheated on me, but ill always like him still.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> NEVER TELL YOUR SISTER OR ANYONE ELSE!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> candy and a nice hand made card ;)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> go on a diet & exercise.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> If its at work its ok.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> we have been married for 5 years and have 2 great kids.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> you're probably starting to see the other side of him and i'm not talking about physical stuff here.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> But if you really want to get rid of him, just talk to him and say so.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_20> !i dont have anything against fruity people but you seem to be fruity urself!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> you must think on why u broke up.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> mr romance (and he needs to be nice, sweet, and hot)
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> you are going to risk your derier when you sent to prison!!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> i dont know about every woman but some can because its not about sex.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> NO she is probably already seeing someone else
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Accusing someone of cheating is a big deal!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> there are lot of people feel ok even to exchange partners
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> not today or ever----if she was intersted she would of said not today, but maybe tomorrow....
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> PS: People matters are not easy because everyone is different in every way.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> i just found out today that he is quitting this job.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> u need some help... has anyone referred u to a psyciatrist???
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> be honest and ask before somebody else takes her away...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> When or have you ever had tears come down only one side of your eye?
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> then give her ONE rose (one is better that 3 dozen) and chocolate
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_15> HES PROBABLY RELE SWEET To yOU AAND POSSIBLY LIKES YOU.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> Well the best thing ta do is start with something kinda neutral.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> i guse it's in the way they act around you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Dont have sex before marriage, then you wont be disappointed
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> the issue here: maybe first change the question.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> But this girl is vulnerable right now, dont break up with her!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> IF SOMEONE FORGOT A IMPORTANT [DATE] I WOULD THINK I'M NOT REALLY INPRTANT OR THERE JUST USING ME.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> big guy of 35 in north of china, like travel , books, tv and happy hours.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> But til then go buy a vib.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> I broke up w/an ex and he was still in love with me.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> Do what he sais h wants you to do.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> honestly...they want the same as us.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> LOLOL... Honey you must be dreaming!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> just look at the number of couples living-in.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> maybe its the drive for a food supply for your children.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_5> JUST BE YOURSELF: DON'T BE FAKE!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> About the nice guys finish last thing... let tell you something.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> pregnancy/abortion/adoption/keeping the baby - whatever she chooses, it's all serious and difficult and painful and expensive.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> it depends on what you spent in on.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> Women don't go after spineless little weasels.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> I see him in my spirit all the time I even once dreamed about him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> see my boyfriend moved back to his home town in N.Y. and i live in TX.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> there's a word that i'm sure you've heard before...  it's pedophile.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> im hot too or do they just like blonds??!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> if she rejects you what is the worst thing that could happen other than you wouldn't be dating her?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> Find someone who cares about you
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> You mean IS jaime going to ask rubi out?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> Act like it doesn't bother you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> I'd imagine if he married you, he loves you....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> no actaly it is better and longer for the both of you
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> She wants to wait until they are married, which isn't for another 2 or so years!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> YOU CAN BE FORGIVEN, BUT REMEMBER YOUR BOYFRIEND WON'T FORGET.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> *EDIT*  Hey, not all women out there want power!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Otherwise, I don't think this is gonna work.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> pre-mariital sex could be a bad thing if you do not do it the right way and with protection.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_40> If not date someone else just so every one can c u mean wat u say.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> You wake up one morning and go, who the heck are you???
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> Oh, did I mention we need it soon!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> To send me money, even when I tell her I have enough.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_25> I have it sucks like A biootch
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> If you wait she may move on and find some one else.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> Cindy is rite I couldnt have said it better if I wnted to
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_20> cook it better next time.. lots of luck
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> to late you both did   so many girls you have to pick just one silly man
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> I just dont get it and its really pissing me off latley!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> if not, what should i do?
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> You know what you are looking for in a person, you just have not found them yet.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> You may love her, but ... why not get involved with someone with less bagage?
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_25> why cant i leave this ass of man i am with?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> I'll be back in a few mins tho
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> NO, you have to get back to dating sooner or later
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> I like this one girl we were just friends.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_15> GIVE IT A HALF AN HOUR AND GET BUSY.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> but i ask myself why does it get me aroused?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> I have seen girls kissing girls (and using tongue) in a coffee house near me.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> I BELIEVE YOU ARE A LITTLE CONFUSED ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS FOR HER.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> Did you break up with her because you did something wrong?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> well u shouldnt care if u are the one who broke his virginity.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> I told my wife about her and she told me to do what I had to do.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Be ur self and u shouldn't have anything to worry about...
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> whatever it is...... take me for granted, you'll end up hurting 3 hearts..
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> i have the same problem with my momma getting in my business too, i just ignore her opinions!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> It depends if you left her or she left you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> we mabey talking to our ex 1-3 times a month sometimes not at all
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> You guys are still young to think about sexual problems anyway.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> HE DIDNT MEEN HE HATED YOUUU.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> i have no answer ....   people enlighten me why are breasts so amazing?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> LOOKING FOR THE SAME THING THAT LED YOU TO THE FIRST RELATIONSHIP IN THE FIRST PLACE.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> Right now, I love being gay.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Thank you for askin...I love u!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> no i dont think she is a lesbian i think shes just strange!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> And i no how lesbo's can be i no one.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> I hate it, why should I do it to men?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> mix them and you could have a perfect relationship
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> But only if if you really love that person.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Best thing to do is to ask.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> But you guys just need to first off talk.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> swallow your pride and do it!!!!!!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> If she's your friend and she likes girls so what?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> Yes, OK, Yeah that's all I got ooopps!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> suck it up and deal with it.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> Next time, don't be so impulsive!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> it want let me log on in my name i used all the time it want connect
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> wish know any kind lady for friendship and happy, just get me in yahoo.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_25> If so I'd be angry at him and ask him what's going on...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> Sometimes being friends with someone is way more than you could ever ask!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> But please.......go talk to your friend......and soon!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> EVEN THOUGH HE'S CALLING YOU BAD NAMES (RIGHTFULLY SO) HE'S STILL COMMUNICATING W/ YOU AND THAT'S GOOD.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> I CLOSE MOST OF MINE WITH A HUG UNTILL THE RELATIONSHIP BUILDS UP STRONGER.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Asking her friends is a no,no.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> I dont know what to do.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> anyways i wanna have fun not b stuck w/1 person when i don't like them alot.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> because that is what it would be.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Don't *nag* and *whine* to him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> What is it like to be straight?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> IF SHE HAS BEEN HURT BY SOMEONE RECENTLY THEN YOU CAN ONLY BE HER FRIEND.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> So far sounds like its going pretty well - dont rush it!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> I fake once in a while, guys try so hard, and I like to reward them...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> remember that both presents don't have to be extravagant.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> I LIKE HIM AND EVERYTHING BUT I THINK WE HAVE LOST INTEREST IN EACHOTHER!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I could go on and on.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> don't listen to jdh783,I'm way cooler!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> My mom's best friend wants to throw me a bridal shower.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Think about that the next time you tell just a little fib.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> yeterday and it was the best sex ever
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> no becuz u are a LONGHORN fan and she is a USC fan!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_55> I know you said only for women but I hate discrimination.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> tell your friend to rock on.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_10> And impostant GET HIS PHONE NUMBER!!!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> ummm....try to ask how she feels about you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> I had a nice hot bath drawn and gave him a bath then a massage.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> 15 we was together for 2 years...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> tell your friend to rock on.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> And impostant GET HIS PHONE NUMBER!!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> ummm....try to ask how she feels about you.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> I had a nice hot bath drawn and gave him a bath then a massage.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> 15 we was together for 2 years...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if so then why would he want you to ask a question like this .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> yes give him a chance and give urself one  love dont come to us everyday
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> (but that still doesn't make her hitting ok)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> He went back to her without telling me and then she finally told me.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> dont thnk about it just do it
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> Just say Look, you are a nice guy but the chemistry isn't right.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> I say dont do it, it's  just a waste of time.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> na, she'll treat you like trash
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Your never to young for love,wen i was 11 i had a 16 year old girlfriend:-).
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> shes probably sweet and classy, so just give her a chance.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> If you wouldn't ask him, then it's inappropriate to ask her.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> no fn way its the only truly right thing in this world
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> If his last name is right guy ;)............
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> it just dipends on the girl.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_30> Unless you too are a freak....RUN!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> if u like him it dont matter wat ur friends think!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> yes it takes time and other friends
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> $2500.00 was the cost of mine!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> I might have made a mistake in my marriage, kickin' it with two girls who weren't my wife.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> try to have sex with the girl.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Of course its the getting started thats the hard part.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> dude if yor shy like i am you might have a hard time doing this.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> then the persons race;religion etc... should never be an issue
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> (Most call it playing the field)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> hav some dignity man...world is full of girls?proposing again will leave a tag for u tht is 'desperado'
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> she will make up her own mind weather she will consider or not
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Start looking at men in public.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> So, brief answer is: You don`t make girlfriend there, just acquaintances :) Otherwise its purely platonic relations until marriage.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> If you like him then yeah try it out!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Ah, something I forgot - sometimes you have to be a little frank.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> iT SEEMS THAT YOU REALLY LIKE THIS GUY..SO PLEEEEAASSE DON´T LISTEN TO YOUR STUPID FRIENDS!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I know it sounds like a formula but girls are hard to figure out and this always works.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I don't know which is worse?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> That he doesnt want nothing with you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> and he still thinks only HE has
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> what if verdale is totally wrong?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> And then would you really be happy?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> 3 days per week  so it may be 12 per month...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> because I rather spend a great time with a funny guy, no matter where we go !
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Wedding gifts are more for the the couple, so that would be more like household items, etc.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> Oh and I'm 19 by the way.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> if he ignores you like that, he's not worth it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> I love him but...I don't know!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> I'm 25 and I still haven't had a girlfriend....is that weird?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> love is love...justas long as it doesn't involve me i m totally ok with it!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> So I say it turned out ok.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> it is best to stay true to your wife
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> A good BJ is always welcome
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> an abortion is a pretty traumatic thing, and she obviously thought that was her only option.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> it is for his/her own good.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> for eg, confess to him that you like a schoolmate.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> u can do both at the same time, or at different times.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> i was wrong in breaking off.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> how do u deal with that?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> i'm really mad at my best friend.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> you should get the ring back.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> because he is scared of commitment
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> from past experiences, my ex- boyfriend is still not over it, and it maks the matter worse.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> IF I am just dating the person it seems to be ok...if you find out let me know...Good Luck
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> maybe he's freaked out that someone likes him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Even though I still critize them(lovingly)about his age.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Don't believe no one , no one is perfect in this world
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> or tell her fake things that she wants to hear.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_25> Nix that zero and get you a hero!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> I have to agree with one answer, you can't tell if she's good at faking.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> no im not heartless i just haven't found the guy that i want 2 b with 4 a while.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> it never works if i try to be cool.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> HOT guy who treats me good is best.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> funny its better to have a good timee!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> She could only tell you yes or no.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> dumb question i have ever seen...!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> hot fast prolonged extra heavy duty stuff happening..
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> just wait for him to pop the question.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_10> JUST LOOK AROUND THEY ALL LOOK LIKE DUDES
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> no.... well at least mine havent.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> i dont think so at all if your intent is honorable then its all good
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> you just know that she isnt interested the same way.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> but you other half is with you always.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> kiss = I want to see you again.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> These are all the sign's I got from that scary guy...again run like the wind.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> if u dont do it, someone will.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> first date-hug if u really know him-kiss
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Just don't make it your priority, and you'll be OK.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_60> go to the dictionary and look up moil.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> tell her never to take such risks like that.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> if u dont do it, someone will.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_45> first date-hug if u really know him-kiss
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> Just don't make it your priority, and you'll be OK.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> go to the dictionary and look up moil.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> tell her never to take such risks like that.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_25> this is how i feel about my ex
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> And she emailed me back trying to twist it around like it's my fault!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> why is it the first thing i go for during sex??
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_45> just normal steps and work your way back up slowly.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> &talk to more people even if they're not goth.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> How to get him to aprove of me?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> How to tell if a girl likes you?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> That not only is a lack of respect it is a lack of Brains!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> I gotta go there ta buy some shoes.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> are we talking like a tan here?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> At least there's sex (while it lasts!)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> Just ignore her, don't even trip.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> I think it would be hot.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> we haven't talk to other for a while and its really sucks.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> what kind of music do u listen to when you want to get in the mood
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Well I wouldnt blame him, guys tend to be like that.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> THIS IS GOING TO BE HARD.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> email me it's just my usename at yahoo.com ok. Don't yell at me.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> A lot of women think that their men are cheating on them even they are not.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> as long as you don't get pregnant
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> just ask agian and if she syas it agian then ask why until you get an answer.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> you just know you have a feeling in your heart that says thats him that him alright!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Change the way you think about things that's probably why she dumped you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> i will say hi to u to ha ha but i would say wow thats interesting
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> Do not try to push her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> If that doesn't get the ball rolling, you might need to move on....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> listen to her and be sincere when you tell her something.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> Sometimes she gets mad, and complains but it's ok.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_25> maybe you should go to a doctor.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> not stepping up and being a man.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> When you do not need to ask that question.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> I have been travelling the world and you should see what I have seen in some cultures!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> Clue:Try not getting them in the 1st place :o)
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> Don't let anyone put them down.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> Chocolates and flowers, plus a tender lovin Kiss!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> He just wants you to be happy if he really loves you.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> no...but my friends did...she was like soooo sad!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> to some it's fine, others its wrong.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> Personanilty, becuase that's what lasts, looks don't always last.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> See if there's any wrong actions that you might do, but you actually don't realize.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Every guy is like either your my girlfriend or not a friend at all It realy sucks.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> don't dress too messy or else people will think you're weird.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> Life is full of suprises though.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> it's awesome that you care about her and want to help.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> Like moi, I went out with someone for 3 yrs and I'm his friend now.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> If some breaks your heart will you ever stop loving them
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> I cared about him very much but I just knew he wasn't the one I wanted to be with.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> it's like she don't care for my friendship anymore.. why's that?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Yes, and When you least expect it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> be your self thats wat i do.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> = ) hope your friends are good friends.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> or should i ask her to marry me before college and then get married during or after college?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> Even if most guys don't like cigars too much it's fun to get a gift like that.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> if he is very curtious and sexy
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> LET BOTH KNOW THAT YOU WILL DARE OTHERS AND DATE BOTH AND SEE HOW IT GOES
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> sex before marrage isnt a good thing to do.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> what matter most is what's inside and most of all he is good looking right?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> using your legs is better than your back.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> she's not a sykic after all.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> if u think u love her u should ask her out...duh.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> but it could be different for you.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> I'm obsessed with latinas - they're hot!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Please clarify...do you mean cheat their wives?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> can i contact him without looking like a complete fool.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> no one is  perfect in this world
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> And then they don't have a choice
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_15> nothing would happen, everyday if important for love
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> First do the job  and than ask your best friend:what do i do now.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Have a great time and congrats for being picked !!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> my shortest 1 day which was my 1st.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> My mom, mentor, caretaker, surpermama, 1 of my bfs, oh and BOSS!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> its f***ing AGAINST NATURE, ADAM AND STEVE STORY
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> yes, very much it is very heart warming & it gives me great pleasure/
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> That would look really funny, too!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> It's all a trust issue, i'm not entirely sure I trust him, but he probably did.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Is the woman I'm marrying a psycho?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> see what they can get, they only want one thing
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Yeah tonight im going out with some friends.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> If not, leave her, and don't be afraid to!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> 'Hey, ya wanna hang out at the mall this weekend...
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> it is good to believe him for a happy life
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> YOU BE THE BEST YOU CAN BE AND LOVE UNCONDITIONALLY.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> and some of us are very comfortable with it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Buy two and go with him it's HUGE FUN!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> I didn't know that they all did but I sure do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> people oftentimes say that they are but then in a few years from now they end up apart.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Easy to say and it's polite.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> but i will still let him know how much i care about him or her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO SAY NO.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> yeah,why not,if they like the guy
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Depends on how well you know him and like him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Did she stick an alkaseltzer tab up there?
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> and i left room for errors.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Probably cheaper because everybodyelse is having a barbeque
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> My brain's fried...and I'm a bit loopy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> and when ur ready u will tell her everything.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> is everything ok between the two of you?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> between your breast is sure to please your man!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> It's not hard to find the right girl at all!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> If not then don't worry about it he doesn't have a crush.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if he actually waits for you than you know that he truly loves you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> I don't really think that age should matter.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> you i think are his wif .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Guys do it too but i think not as much as females.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> And my teacher told me not to listen to strangers.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Not unless she is nice enough to give it back.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> Depends if U get 2 see her Daily.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> If hes lieing or being honest you will know.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> go up to her and say: I like you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> go on with youir life, what's kg?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> well i am 6'2'' tall he's not !
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> - this prevents getting hurt allot.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Due to ur new info then id say No don't go out with him, It will only end bad!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> in a store wid condoms in one hand and viagra in the other
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> He didn't have a reason but just said, I think we should just be friends.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> you shouldn't is this leana valeros?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> maybe she has some personal problems,
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> So the way I look at it you might as well be happy
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> because i want it bad thats all i fantasize about
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> If it takes away from her, then its cheating.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> but i never agree, i knew we were only friends.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> maybe she has some personal problems,
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> So the way I look at it you might as well be happy
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> because i want it bad thats all i fantasize about

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> as long as i keep my mouth shut and have no opinion things are good-for him.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> Turn off the T.V.,sit yourselves down,and start talking!

<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> and ladiez if you have any idea why you have the power??
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> but he still didn't tell me.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> Hmmm - I would call her back.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> i want a boy that have respect for me and likes to party with a girl
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_95> No I dont think they are.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> you are a male cyber whore - i should man bitch slap you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> But once I'm interested they disappear
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I don't want my name showing on the yahoo messenger list how do I show my screen name instead
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Do u think it is right.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Maybe you married a child...not a grown man.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> I listen to the cds I love find a song that relates to your life and meorize the words!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> no if u really love them you wouldn't let them go
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> if you have to bait him into it then it is not really him wanting to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> or maybe he's looking at gay porn and doesn't want you to know.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> i recently got broken up with over the phone on the guys break from work.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> yeah get a small flake of metal in there.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> If she gets embarrassed, it's ok.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> i want to be with someone who wants to be with me just the way i am.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_55> you cant trust someone you are chatting with
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> give up trying to date her - plenty of fish in the sea :-)
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> jut get it figured out so u don't get hurt in the end
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> eventually they'll get over themselves and realize what their missing.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> stop being gothic what's the deal any way looking like the dead.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> You can't if she's a good actress.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_30> can anyone help me out to define love
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> Go with the one that nicest, and the one you like the best.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> well if u love her apparently u dont hate her or vice versa.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Don't have you're hopes up to much.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Smell like a goat in heat?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> yes i can totally tell by the way you typed.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_95> depends on what your conscience thinks.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> if you are over 18-20 give it a try but do not rush to anything.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> Ive offerd wonderd this and after what bradd said... Jessica Alba
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_45> They are the one missing out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Guys will always be around but youthfulness won't.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> If you don't there could be a BIG mess.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> You don't come home one day and say oh i learned how to love.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> HOW DOW YOU SET UP A PERFECT 1 NIGHT STAND?
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_50> DO NOT take her to a movie or dinner.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> I'm not saying that is right...I'm just saying that that what IS, sometimes.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> by the way its ok for a girl to ask the guy out actually its becoming more common.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> Its like they always want all or nothing.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> don't do that to yourself, him, or her.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_20> Definately get roses, lots of them.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> it didn't go any farther than a 5 second kiss.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> that sould be fine , but how old  are you?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_15> IT MAKES US ENJOY SEX MORE
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> That drives me up a frikkin wall!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_10> Definately get roses, lots of them.
<NbChars_40> <LevSim_10> it didn't go any farther than a 5 second kiss.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> IT MAKES US ENJOY SEX MORE
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_10> That drives me up a frikkin wall!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> You: -thinking if she's asking you to eat a bowl of jell-o- Yessums!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> Up until now, I still have feelings for him, and i haven't gone out with anyone since.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> Stop looking so hard she is probably right in front of you...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> ask the girl to pay for dinner
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> brunnetes, the girl i like has brown hair!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> YOU ARE JEALOUS OF A PICTURE?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> when they got all upset about that, he responded hey, just kidding, i'm only gay!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Im pretty close to being 23.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> they want someone who listens, cares, and caresses.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Just be there for her and be her friend.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> if you don't like himm say oh well good for you i don't care!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> were a little cocky here aren't we??
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Don't EVER ask your mate to do something you wouldn't do first.Ever.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> Try going out on dates again!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> ok do some other execise and do good execises.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_55> skinny,a nice stomach is a major turn on
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> because almost all the girls have a boyfriend so that means there are no more boyfriends
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> cool to be in an open minded relationship...i am too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> if u looking for someone u shouldnt call them a chick
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> or HOW DOW YOU SET UP A PERFECT 1 NIGHT STAND?.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> They bigger the breasts the more fertile the woman is...
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> Some women learn this, others do not.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> is a pretty messed up concept.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> Just because youre gothic though doesnt mean you shuold hang out with only gothic kids.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> I am already doing IT with the one I love.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Maybe its a possibility, especially when u smile Iy could be love!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> If you like him go out with him, but if not don't.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> are you mad cuz he spends money on these sites?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> (Someone I know propsed in the bathroom... just wondering if anyone else had other crazy ideas.)
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> I hope yours is a keeper!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Guys never mind girls showing interest.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I don't really care about looks, but I do like nice people.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> I hope this helps in some manner, take care.....
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> but a lot of times i prefer sucking than f***ing
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> But dont start it off like that.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> just few seconds when i was born...my mom was first to kiss me...
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> Didn't care about being promoted, etc.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> Hey,  I advise u to pray.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> in detail,is it necesary to fall in love.cant u escape it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> i mean WHOEVER SAID THAT SEX WAS ONLY FOR MARRIED PEOPLE??
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Well you have been married long enough to ask him whats bugging him.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> It's my bad habit, i can't help it, they taste good!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> He said yea..BUT what if she's the best?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> U WILL RIDE TO THE END WITH THAT PERSON AN WOULDN'T HAVE TO THINK TWICE.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> he is my brothers friend so i cant get away from him HELP!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> winter if your on a budget.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> can you say polygamy  one man two wives...  read learn try it
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> umm...chocolate but dont give her alot it might be an insult to her...ummm...flowers would be the best choice!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> but I think the reason it is so different is because men dont get all loose and sloppy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> a lot of couples have sex without talking about marriage at all.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> lol, this is a tough question.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_45> the only thing is hes 62
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> I know why you're so obsessed with us mijo!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> it is just showing that you would like ot be friends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> ok, i met my boyfreind over the internet hes in tennessee and im in atlanta.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Guys want what they can't have.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> Many of my friends have this problem...
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_25> Nothing to hold on to... to control.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> can't go wrong with attention and presents!
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_45> hmmm, i only have one partner.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_10> IF HE KNEW THESE GUYS, HE IS SO HUMILIATED.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> they are testing you to see how much they are going to get away with.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> well...ask him: i need to relax with some friends for once.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> holy crap, you should feel guilty.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> -- Has he forgiven his ex-wife?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> not to many men ask there wifes this i know.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_20> relationships have to be 2 way.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> Can you see yourself spending the rest of your life with them?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> Slowly...first you get a paying job.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> She may be liking you too!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> well they are a bit different.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Going from guy to guy until he finally pops your cherry!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> me and my partner spend most of our free time in bed!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> TRUE LOVE IS WHEN ITS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR U TO BE WITHOUT THAT SPECIAL SOMEONE.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> or made a big mistake in your life?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> He used your diamond, what a loser!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> cause you could just seduce him with some skin.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> Give him a night out with the boys first.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> why worry about what other people think?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> This ain't Burger King, you're not always going to have things your way.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> because they feel you have takin their child from them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> well then they never have time for you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> my husband was 18 and i was 22 when we got married.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> If he is not sorry and didnt tell you then no
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_30> not today and most likely .
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> You just got dumped dude, it's over.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> Has she ever flirted Wit u??
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Valentine's Day............ the day of love.....
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> show people you have your own style.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> I say good for you if you want to wait.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Is it Match.com, eharmany, lavalife... who?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Is it bcoz your dad is looking and right now he seems to be loosing the battle?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> just ask her out and give her something nice.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> But, what if one person is that way and the other is not?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> because you're gonna give me 10 wonderful points ;)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Trust me girl, if he loves, he never freeks out on you...!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> it cud b jus 1...   ur mom... she wont cheat lie or break ur heart whatever u do...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> they want a guy who wont treat them lke crap and respects them
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> are you comfortable in your own skin??
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_55> I asked her to coffee and she said yes.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> Trust me girl, if he loves, he never freeks out on you...!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> it cud b jus 1...   ur mom... she wont cheat lie or break ur heart whatever u do...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> they want a guy who wont treat them lke crap and respects them
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> are you comfortable in your own skin??
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> I asked her to coffee and she said yes.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> There you go - problem solved.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> She cheated on you in that way.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> if you dont like it as much as u do with chris.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> IT SOUND LIKE YOU NEED TO HAVE A LONG HEART TO HEART WITH HER.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> Don't let them get to you, because they're just putting you down.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Girls too like and enjoy taking about sex.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Heck that can get back to normal almost immediately if you want.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> im assuming hes your age right?
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_10> THIS IS YOUR DAY, TAKE YOUR TIME AND SEE WHAT COLORS AND DIFFERENT STYLED DRESSES COMPLIMENT EACHOTHER AND YOU!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> you should be able to answer that quetion ur self
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Girls too like and enjoy taking about sex.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> Heck that can get back to normal almost immediately if you want.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> im assuming hes your age right?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_10> THIS IS YOUR DAY, TAKE YOUR TIME AND SEE WHAT COLORS AND DIFFERENT STYLED DRESSES COMPLIMENT EACHOTHER AND YOU!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> you should be able to answer that quetion ur self
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> i have a gf but if u want to talk lilcountskid
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> well if it is the bed then use wd40 on they hinges where the pole meet.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> TRUE LOVE IS WHEN U WILL DO WHATEVER FOR THAT PERSON NO MATTER WHAT.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> it is kind of important when you doit with someone you love.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> After that, if she pays you no attention she probably just is not interested.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Why do girls talk about boys?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> get to know him first in person.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> Get off the internet and find a girl!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> There are lots of goodlooking jocks out there scoping for a beautiful lady!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> flowers, candy, romanic dinner, jewerly if you got deep pockets!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> If sex is bad then it sure feels good to be bad.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> when butterfly flies in your stomach.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> buy new clothes and start going back to the gim.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> If she doesn't have those, then no.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> do you:  a) break up with her b) stay together and forget the whole thing?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> yeah, i hope u didnt do it!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> Just don't have sex just to be having it.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> u have to be careful toooooooooo......
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> if you ask him with believing heart.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> If he loves you than why in the world would he want you to marry someone else?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> i get worried when i thinks if she says me 'NO'.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> so, imagine my surprise when I got home and found his wife down on my roommate!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> you're mind is not clear right now!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> Wow, I could use the $1 mil...  but lose a marriage?
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> I was not her pick to marry her son.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> looks can fade; personality usually doesn't
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> IF NOT THEN WE CAN MOVE ON TO THEIR PERSONALITY.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> You don't want it to be that way.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> she was going out with a really awesome guy.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> And from her friend it was a mistake!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> Do some nice things for her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> figure out if mark is the one then if he is ......go for it!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> You don't want it to be that way.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> she was going out with a really awesome guy.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> And from her friend it was a mistake!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Do some nice things for her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> figure out if mark is the one then if he is ......go for it!
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_30> ya i think ur in luv...be happy
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> TIME HEAL ALL WOUNDS,SO GIVE HER TIME.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> Tell him you will have sex with him....guys love that.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> being daddy's little girl he has given me the freedom to be myself.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> Listen you do what you want.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> If u love her than you shouldn't have a problem making her feel special.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> this is such a stupid question.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> if you like someone pass her a note sometime or get a hold of her e-mail and phone #.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> (it's not that i think it's gross, it's just nobody likes me)
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> date someone because you want to be with them, not because youre lonely.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> he needs to do it on his own.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> I fall in love every day!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> BUT AN OLDER WOMAN WOULD BE MY CHOICE, I'M 22 YEARS OLD.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> TO BE HONEST WITH YA SOME FEMALE CONTRACEPTIVES CAN MAKE THIS HAPPEN...GOOD ?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> if you loved him like you were supose to you would not have to asked this question.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> bu tif you like him I don't know what to tell you to tell him
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> Sex on the first date...hmmm...yea it's a turned off.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> no - she keeps the ring.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> i'll expect that he'd make up for it  (hint, hint)
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> I have been told it just adds enjoyment to the night out... yea alright..
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> i totally agree with heavytrafficman, it is so true what he said i could not answer it better myself.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> i wanted for them to like me so much, but it just wasnt so.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> second - what is in premarital sex?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> I want her to love me like I love her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> and the other thing is understanding.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> how hard is it to find the right guy?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> i used to think he was an idiot, but now im interested.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> Don't come here to whine, you know that all women are users, just get used to it.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> my longest relationship was 7 1/2 years and i'm only 29.  crazy, huh?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> If you miss her and it was your fault!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> no  you as a person knows when your ready for whateva your talking about your ur own person!!!!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> my best friend is a straight guy and i am gay.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> plus they are warm and soft ha ha.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> It might help to kno ur age!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> !..OR WHAT..THEY FEED YOU, BUY YOU CLOTHES ETC.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> maybe i don't know them though
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> people like the little game of hard to get.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> because the guy just straight foward or crocked type.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> I personally do not think it does.But think about it :o)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> lets try to rephrase the question by asking:  what makes/helps women reach orgasm??
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> U should wait til both of you guys are doen with all of that.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> YOUR CHILDREN NEED YOU AND YOU SHOULD BE THERE FOR THEM
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> Try asking this: DO I LIKE OR DO I LOVE THIS GUY?
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_30> I´m a guy, I´ll tell you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> But if you dont get out there and look you will never really get over your ex.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> No u should not go ahead with her.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> i am current dating this man where i work.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> but know this, no matter what you do only time can heal all your wounds!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> we gals will always remain mystery to guys.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> do what I did and marry a cop....lol
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> This will eventually come out, don't hide secrets and stuff, people always find out.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> TRY THIS BE HONEST ABOUT WHY.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Spice up your life with your wife.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> make him see that you only like him as a friend.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> (yes im bitter leave me alone)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> Get that out of him and make your judgement call
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> I didn't really like it back then.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Well, What are u waiting for?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> STILL LIKE BEING A GOTH AS LONG AS  U DRESS GIRLIE GIRL
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> if she's making too much noise
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> precious, i'm 30 & still over do it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> TRY HAVING HIM DO IT HIMSELF FIRST .
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> i dont know but, why wont they go out with me either??!!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> If the girl is really asian (like asian born and bred), the guy has to be smart...
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_35> when u think/feel like talking/calling someone the first person who comes to ur mind is this person.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> no it is not wrong, but unwise.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Yup there are plenty of us here.

<NbChars_205> <LevSim_25> be careful, you can get std's from female juices too!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> i don't really think anyone can be sure that they are in love.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> HE LIED ABOUT HOW HE FEELS EITHER BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT TO GET HURT OR HE JUST WANTS SOME.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> A boy you have to make notice you, a MAN already has!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> U should press your lips agenst hers ( then you should open your mouth just a little-or a lot)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Or did he just drop in on you front porch?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> explain to her what she did was wrong and why it was wrong.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> but most of the times if u have a friend thats a girl she could like you too.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Good Luck huntin' for that G-Spot.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> I acked like I loved him and she treats him likr he's her slave.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> when you can think of nothing but the other person, and you get a funny feeling in your tummy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Forget about her if you love her or even care about her do not get her involved.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> Hang in there girl ... God has a purpose for everything ...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> My problem is what if I run into him again?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> sleep with a girl just to experiance it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> i'm not in the mood or feign being asleep.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> God provides lots of good things!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> not to sound selfish...but you come fisrt.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> I wouldnt, i have alot of gothic friends and i wouldnt exaclty call myself gothic at all.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> Guys have different masks, women do to though.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> He probaly likes u too but he's shy go for it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> to tell the truth don't know.

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> does she touch herself while talking to u?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> you get to test out the couch.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> don't eat sugar and no more sodas.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> lazarus cooler name  verdale sounds like a pussy
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> or c. move to a different province?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> no crying ur eyes out more than once a day.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> hell no you shouldnt thats really rude
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> I would say 5 to 6
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> If her marriage is so bad then she should get out of it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> no, because what if my soulmate was located in the middle of mongolia traveling in a band of nomads?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> YEAH YOU HAVE TO GIVE US MORE TO GO BY.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> if he says no he's probably makin a bad mistake.. you are probably really nice.... Good luck!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> im just wondering if blondes really do have fun lol
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> A promise ring is sure way to doom your relationship, i've seen it too many times before!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> IF YOU DON'T CHOOSE ONE YOU WILL END UP LOOSING BOTH.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> for me and my husband it was better this way.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> But if u really want 2 get with him then go 4 it!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> is this you first gf ever?
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> You seem too nice for that.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_20> - What about you makes her so crazy?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> Look for the ones that do, (what)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If it's gonna cost me money, I want a younger man, not an older one!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> Besides...if the person is funny...that sense of humor...might allow him/her..to dress up cuter..or at least put a mask on...=P
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> take a vacation or go do something for you!
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_25> OK, I admit, I'm a perfect fit.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> Go for it but just if you realy like him !!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> i used to run around like an idiot trying to appease to everone, and i was wearing myself down.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_45> if you look, you wont find.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> Remember 3 things, 1) there is a big difference between love and lust.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Don't fall for the first jerk you see.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> i wan2 have more gothic or punk friends how do i meet them
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> I normaly talk to myself, but talking to God is a better idea im sure
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> it's just something about the way you asked....mmm..no
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> Watch a woman who is good at it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> if its too overwhelmin to ya then just ask her out.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Ive known him for like ever.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> I still ask myself why he broke up with me.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> when u think he likes u back
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> romantic- 20 years friends- 36 years
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> and large is when you want to just f u  c  k  !
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> And when my dad got remarried he gave me a watch, with a message engraved on the back!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> hide it 4 as long as u can
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Ever heard of Play hard to get?..
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> if your so honest why do you have a pic of a girl avatar?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> If your not married                               then it sounds like your boyfriend is the jelous kind.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> if peeple are judgemental den thas who der gonna b. yoo dont need to worry bout dem.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> or is it bcoz you want one for your dad?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> you should get some mighty fine reactions, and then see what happens.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> And now I don't know what to do, because I really love my sister.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> but i f its true love then leave it i mean are you jelsouse you like this boy.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> singin...doe, a deer, a female deer.....  hee hee
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> You don't have to be enemies.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> repot it or brake up with her
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> You don't have to be mean, you just have to be strict.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> don't go just by the way he looks.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> It would be crappy if she didn't want a part.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> In your heart ;)  Remember, you get what you give;
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_10> SOUNDS TEMPTING, BUT THE ANSWER ALWAYS ENDS UP TO A NO!NO WAY!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> there are girls out there than have no problem going out once and then going beck to your place.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> Youngest 2 = Page Boys Older 2 = Grooms Men / Ushers!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> i lik the obi wan kool star wars
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> have you ever experience love or what you thought was love before?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> how would you feel if your 15 year old sister was going out with a 26 year old man?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> If you don't like them, then tell them that!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> yes can be trusted but if you can't look beyond that, move on
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> That will be the best revenge :)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> just flirt and ask questions that u have in ur head and from whatever she says take ur desision
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> Plus not so much a chance for tornadoes
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> If it feels like something isnt right,  probably isn't!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> We still talk and he has asked me out again.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> Or what ever she's not happy with about her-self?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Men are not that differnt from women.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> BE GLAD IT'S NOT A REAL WOMAN AND YOU ARE APT TO DRIVE HIM TO ONE.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> and what if he refuses to talk after that or gives me a piece of his mind.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> LOL j/k I have no idea.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> OF COURSE YOU SHOULD TELL THEM.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> we're all boring sometimes, there'a always something fun about somebody.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> I feel horrible about this but I wont date a guy shorter than me.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> there really is no good way to do it.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> I think he still has that girlfriend but I don't care.
<NbChars_280> <LevSim_25> Wait to say i love you.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_20> I should know I have an BoyFriend!!!!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> do what you think is best.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> if you think he is hot, then go for it and be with the boy!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> go go go lol try dating another female if u feel comfortable and relaxed ull know wat to do.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> then i had my 4th which was 2 weeks.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> i am totally single and definately not gay, and dont drink.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> otherwise have a wonderfull time :)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> a full day at the spa
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> KEEP IN MIND IMM THIRTEEN AND A BIG FLIRTER
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> then i had my 4th which was 2 weeks.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_10> i am totally single and definately not gay, and dont drink.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_10> otherwise have a wonderfull time :)
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> a full day at the spa
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> KEEP IN MIND IMM THIRTEEN AND A BIG FLIRTER
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> I think we are all just looking to have more fun in our lives!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> They will give you a TON of info on that.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> The question is, DO YOU LIKE TO DO IT?????
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> At any rate, I don't really dig rich guys, I don't think, unless they're well-mannered and attractive.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> Could some body give me a great big WOW!!!!!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> if so, then it should be rather easy to ask the girl out.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> or maybe he's just plain mean.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> Do you know the girl that you like?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> dont forget that no matter how our mother looks, but we always love her more then the others.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> And with webcams, camera phones etc.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Course my problem is they always want to go out with me, never want to just be friends.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> well my friend is goth e-mail her dollonesk8@yahoo.com
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Ask her, if she didn't like you as that, why did she say she did?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> then you can cut out fast food resturants for a while.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> i'm intersting in now what would be the best thing to do shave, or wax?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> but we in general do not discriminate
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> If your guy has a sense of responsibility and is mature like you say give it a chance.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> At least that's what I think.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Yahoo Personals is pretty cool as well...
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> does the verdale guy like you too?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> But the charm i have is that i ALWAYS admit when i am wrong  good luck
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Then his girlfriend gets pregnant has a baby.... she still doesn't leave him.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_35> can a black man and a white woman be happy?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> You MUST meet him first !!!!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> sent a letter about your love
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> didn't you here about that girl who was harrassed by here new computer met bf?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> get the drift,  if they havent had sex for a few days more.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> how does he make you feel?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> There are other people, im sure, that dont judge you just because you dress or act gothic.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> i love to go shopping and go to the movies.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> cooking him a good dinner took him out of town  spent money and time with him
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> no it isn't and yes she can if she wants to
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> -Friends who I can actually trust (I realized that friends aren't always what they seem to be.)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me... no more.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> You need to leave her... you have a life to live.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> I know, crazy, but it always works for me with guys.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> If you have a singles club at church that would be good too.Good Luck!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> you can do so if you love each other.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> i actually kissed my gf when i am 16.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Nope and I'm just a GIRL age 10.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Second step, tell her she's the one you're dreamin of.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Why not is more like it !!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Were u with him the whole 20 years???
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> You don't know if you don't ask!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> dude be careful with russian girls.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Hell, if you like him that much, kiss him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> If he loves you, thats his problem, not yours if you dont love him back.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_15> DUMP HIM HONEY HE IS A LOW SELF ESTEEMED PRAT.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> Slow it down a little though.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> well i hope i helped some.

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Excitarse sexualmente, hacerse lascivo o lujurioso.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Austrailian guys can do no wrong
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> then, you can love sth/so else and you'll find sth or so that worths your very special attention...
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> At least my mind thinks I am...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> If they do, you don't want to be with them anyway.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> i just love her so much.. much help would be appreciated...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> when they hav a boner, its 6 and a half inches
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> I dont think there is any way u can cheat people when u use different names.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> you feel it inside in your heart
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Don't tell anyone I told you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> why do i need think about it 24/7?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> when you're lonely and u have nothing to do, u want to talk to someone,ryt?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> But its depend on your culture ...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> why does it drive us men crazy?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> this is what u should do.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> just watch out and make sure that he loves you or you will be heart broken
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> it sounds like you did something wrong enough for him not to have faith in you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> U can also just feel it inside n u'll no.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Use your head on this one (the one that sits on your shoulders)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> They gotta be skinny, but not too skinny.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Maybe he is cheating because he just no longer cares???
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> I'm a girl so u better read this.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> tell him how u feel, unless u a coward.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> If you are serious about this girl, then don't allow her to become a missed opportunity.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> I was like...20...it was not too late, tho.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> buy some rope and use it
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> I guess it must be ......
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> why is the woman all was want too run the man life and still be happy?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> heres 1 thing................grls dont ask boys out.. its kinda like u being the boy and asking the grl out.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> and medium is good for when you want to make love.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> You normally have to pay alot & then usaully they don't work.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> I looked at them and felt how gross they were that they weren't my wife.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> sorry about this question it's my first vibe.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Try finding out different things about the girl like where she hangs out and who she hangs out with.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> are YOU a girl and just want to know this?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> I mean come on give me a break.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> but i want to date one girl.but when i meet her i don't know how to say.i forget everythings.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> i think its the dreaded broken dick syndrom.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> well u should know not us
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> i know those types all too well.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Love is a strong word, are you sure he means it
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> And you're even thinking about MARRIAGE and you never even saw the guy for real ??
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> try to sleep with the female
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> She's probably with another guy already
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> I dont know u tell me... i'm guessing yeah.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> If he says he is sorry.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> maybe he's not really feeling it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> J/K   No offence Jayson, I couldn't resist.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Thats it... your sense of humor much inprove ...BUDY
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> I know from experience, you just have to wait!!!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> wat sould i do i dnt like him that much?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> it will find you and only then in that moment will you know you are in love.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> cuz he's a jerk, trying to get over probably the best thing that ever happened to him = U
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> One thing you don't do is send a friend to ask for you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> I do not want to be too mean cuz i don't want them to hate me.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> it wouldn't be any fun if they weren't
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> Just have confidence when you ask.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> No thanks im taken a the moment.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> when i had a good girl freind in 2 years age, i got a specially kiss of she.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_10> NEXT TIME, DON'T PUT YOURSELF IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU MIGHT BEHAVE LIKE THAT.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> hit him in the head say HEY YOU BOY I am over here
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> because male have much more testosterone than female...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> But what if she does go with you?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> can a boy & a girl enjoy premeritalsex?is it advisable?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> Maybe she's just pissed off with you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> the funny thing is my first husband diied and 2 years later i had are son together.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> But what if she does go with you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If u only like him sometimes!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> can a boy & a girl enjoy premeritalsex?is it advisable?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Maybe she's just pissed off with you.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> But I say love is better.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> Nope, you sure dont nor do you get anything else you gave her back, they where gifts!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> Or did you break up with her because she did something wrong?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> when you are , you wont have to ask....
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> i have been asking the same question for years.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> men seem to have a weird way of showing their hurt.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> But don't dump it all on him at once.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> tell her what u feel and want to keep ur private life private.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> It might be because your not looking..Email me at killer_sheep_1
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> You what for a $1 if i didn't love the one i was with.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> What if the one you fall in love with has one like that.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> if he asks u to take him back, reject his @$$!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> i am a girl so i will know.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> spend enough time with someone and you will know.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_15> HEY YOUR ARE JUST FINE, THERES NOTHING WRONG WITH YOU.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> Or you could always try plucking the hair.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_30> if not you better deal with it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> because they both are good people.
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_20> >dinner >arcade >park >bar >coffe shop >beach >mall
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> don't change who you are just to please people.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> A little crazy but not les!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> What the heck did you spend the money on?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> seduce him first, it might help.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> He has a saying:  Strangers ****, Boyfriends and girlfriends have sex But husbands and wives make love .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> just say, i think u r hot will you go out with me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> And, obviously you didn't love her enough to say no.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Guys don't see this as 'wrong', so they don't know that it hurts.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> theres somebody 4 both of u guys (girls).
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> its not wrongin fact i do it when my partner wont put out
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> better rub your eyes and take a second look.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Anyone heard of baby daddies and STDs?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> you should propose to him with an easy out  so it doesnt sound like an ultimatum
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> (Might it say it was a strong one!)
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> which ever one makes you feel beautiful
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> i'm not 100% sure but i'm thinking it was probably just a mistake.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> You can love someone alot but still not be ovsessed w/ them or it!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> You can go back to school or whatever you want... you just have to have a supportive spouse!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> at times u may ignore these people too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Not all men are that way.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> at 12 on new years eve i kissed on of my guy friends cause i was pretty drunk.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> fart on both of them and see which one of them takes it better.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> thats 5 years and demi moore is like 50 and ashton kutcher is like 25.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> THE THING IS I HAVE A BOYFRIEND!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> yes, women actually do enjoy sex, specially if they have a great partner!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> That is like asking what color car goes the fastest, dude.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> either way, there is a reason you two are just friends.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> to get real kiss u ought to be in love.........and i have not met my real love yet
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> The one you have the REAL commitment to!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> broke up with her guy, and went out with my crush!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Space and trust (the harder question is what do women want from men!?!?!)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> yes ask her loved one first that way you dont get into trouble
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Go to See's candy and pick up her favorite sweet.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> If she is not red & moist enough.....
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> quit beating ya meat, if ya want kids someday
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> pain is love, untill you learn more about yourself
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_5> GODD PURR YOU NEED TO SHUT UP>!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> a rose (or her favorite flower) and a card is a good idea.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> but what he said to me really really hurts.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> I DONT KNOW WHAT 2 DO!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> All three of the boys attended and two of my dearest friends and this made it that more special.)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> No matter how bad the other person might be, it takes two to tango.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> by the way, using all caps makes you look really ignorant and stupid
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> you explain your situation to all the other women out there asking why men cheat.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> No, you TAKE the ring back!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Yea, I now it is bad, but I am in love with Chris.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> don't do anything your not comphy doing.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Could have been having troubles at home and it was her way of getting even with her hubby.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> Think about that before you let him come back.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Don't feel too bad if yours doesn't.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> i suppose some men are irresponsible and immature but a real man who is really in love doesn't cheat
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> I hope it wasn't K because you might need to change your screen name!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> 2. maybe he don't love u!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> um....ask him to let u see.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> just go up to him and ask
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> you don't,  get used to it I think she loves you and only wants the best.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> if you do it without her consent, she might get mad, even if he says yes.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> He asked his girlfriend to marry him, she yes, and she seemed really happy.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> Good luck what ever you choose to do with your life!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> u wana get its answer so see the bollywood film GARAM MASALA* U WILL GET UR ANSWER
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> look for the subtlest hints.. but dont wait too long to tell her how u feel abt her.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> My neighbor guy is nice, funny, and just perfect.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> In my experience..no one can trust my ex-husband..I'm just afraid the girls he's around don't know it yet.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> you need to ask yourself, where is this relationship gonna go?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> My sex life is non-existent, because I just found that my boyfriend goes both ways:(
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> Budy... its so easy if you want to become;       1.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i am comfortable with who i am.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> After coffee take a walk somewhere interesting where there will be lots of things to talk about.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> stand up for yourself and just say it.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> Or are you just not doing it right?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> I NEEDED A GOOD LAUGH FOR THE DAY
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> if they tried to explain i would listen but of course they would have to make up for it.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> u must get over ur shyness to talk to her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> you can get an erection by mostly any naked girl, but to love her really keeps it up
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> I think you know the answer to this question, lady!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> DON'T PUSH THIS SITUATION IT COULD END UP TO BE A DISASTER.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> and  my wife and I need our privacy}  That should do it...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> Tee hee hee...  (Yeah, they were butterfly kisses, but still!)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> The easiest way to make your life a living hell is to marry for money
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> you will find a guy to love you .if  you love him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> any girl if love me plz contect this e mail moona_nisha@yahoo.com
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Tell her What you love about her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Maybe you are asking the wrong question...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> it was kind of an internet romance but we both felt as if we were falling in love.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> YOU KNOW WHAT YOU LIKE AND WHAT YOU DONT LIKE.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> just put yourself in his shoes i guess.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> ok first things first... Is he even looking?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Whats the worst that could happen?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Men are not some game you play for fun and prizes.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> if you are sure, go ahead
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> Girl you run from them cuz their not the one you are dateing
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> If you don't want the husband there, then you want something else... and that is just wrong.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> He would talk to me last year but not this year
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> when you cross your eyes 4. but normally 2
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> And it is i'm sure, it was like that for me too.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> But, she is dating your crush, right?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> think of it like this......would you buy a car without test driving it first???
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> heck..  this chica can't even VOTE yet!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> If its a once in a while occurence, just strictly cyber no chatting I think its ok.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> AND NEVER EVER DO IT AGAIN!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> in a place where theres a crowd of beatiful, sexy and seductive women.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> So, what she was saying was Yeah!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> sorry dude, be more careful in the future
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> In my teen years, I found that it actually works the other way around.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> I not saying is ok to do it but u also got to respect ur man.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> if he doesnt remember he probably is a pervert because he might ask alot of girls out!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> He's too nice to say hey, GO AWAY!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> just pull his arms over your shoulders like doing a piggy back ride.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> what is so wrong calling them that?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> thats five years not 4 gee smart one
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> If she was just playing hard to get then try again but at a later time.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> if shes worth it she will
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> cuz if its what i think then this would be some crazy racist question.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> I robbed the craddle, was her high school sweetheart.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> I DOnT LIKE BEiNG CALLEd THAT EVERYDAY ESCPICALLY AROUND OTHERS.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> might save your marrage then might not.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> If he says yes - yay!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> Then we'll start having gang wars and stuff.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> people say i have bestfriend qualities cause im real.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> a gentleman doesnt treat a woman like trash!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> when i was 5 it was the girl next door
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Thers bound 2 b someone right under your nose u jest dont see it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> now i am angry...but i am not using bad words against you.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> Hope you get where I'm going here....  Is she a Taurus????
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> No offense to anybody but its not just guys that do that.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> Heck you only live once right?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> It's like the battered wife syndrome.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> ask him if he want to be with u all the time ( good luck )
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> guys don't always talk about their girl friends or the girls they like.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> but if you want it just for her, treat her to a spa, a complete head to toe treatment.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_30> I agree with everything that everyone else said...they have all perfectly summed it up!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> and try the anal beads they can go in the front or the back.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Ok, when you see her THINK ABOUT JELLY.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> I need advice on discipline ??
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Yeah he's going to want to sleep cause he works alot.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> IT'S BETTER TO LET HIM KNOW NOW THAN TO JUST KEEP HIM ON THE STRING.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> SHE MAY BE FEELING THE SAME WAY ABOUT YOU BUT IS SCARD TO TELL YOU LIKE YOU ARE HER.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> Actually, it surprised me how nice he actually was to me :)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> would it be worth breaking up with lazarus?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> first of all how old are you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Me?04 people, I m 35 yrs old
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> (Not unless I am struck w/ cupid's arrow instantly)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> if you like her, this will be tough.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> it's a sick habit that people get into
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> he should be okay if not good luck
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> have a friend tell him, u just get to the flirting
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> BE HONEST with her and ask her to shower
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> ; )  Plus my mom is where the love is.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> ok heres the devils advocate answer.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> Bring her flowers or something like that.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_30> i told a guy and after a week, he straight out ignored me and we haven't talked since!!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> i mean..DUH it's a free world...  third - who cares?
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> and what would be a could conversation starter?
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_20> Hope i did'nt offend but.... that sounds yag sa kcuf !
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> you asked her to marry you, then you dump her, and want the ring back.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Just cant be afraid to try everything
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Don't be bitter because you're a nice person.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> Just say No Depends what you're saying no to.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> You should be very proud that he loves you so much.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Just be creative and use other things (feather, ice cube, rose).
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> Does he look at naked women on tv/computer/mag's???
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> what is it that defines 'girl of your desire'??
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Chances are even if she doesn't admit it, she is feeling like things are um drum too.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> I spank them on their skirts.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> and what if a person does not want to get married?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> it´s simple, simply say would you like to go out with me to ..... :)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> i would say it is a turn off.
<NbChars_265> <LevSim_20> With a boy - 14, with a girl - 17
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> Sure you're Loopy, you're a female.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> But then I know guys (and some girls) who are only in it for the physical aspect.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> I would just ya know call johnny depp and see which one she chooses!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> do w/e feels rite itll work out either way!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> theres no way yoo can change that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Most of the guys I have dated really didn't care about my emotions or anything like that.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> All anybody has to do is keep it straight and simple that way nobody gets hurt.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> my me feel about things i did in life .
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> i got my first boyfriend when i was 13 it lasted a month
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> Don't try and over do it just let it come natural and she'll see you are a good guy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> u can call her up or say it face-to-face.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Show her the real you and soon she may say yes!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> i remember in my past there were some guys that i sooooooo wanted to go out with.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> man, the richies usually treat others like the owe them everything.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> whoever gets him will hurt the other one.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> if you gave me a diamond engagement ring, i'd have to keep it...don't make that mistake again, goofball!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> 9 times out of 10 your friend will start to date the guy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Thats all i have to say is be creative.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> depends on ur perspective towards life!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> now, i'm at a different place in life.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> U WILL KNOW WHEN IT IS TRUE LOVE, U WOULDN'T BE ASKING THIS QUESTION IF IT WAS.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> well if he was such a good man why is he divorced Just think about
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> just have confidence in your self!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> And they stop or don't do bjs anymore.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> Im 25, is alright to date a 22 year old guy?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_10> I REALLY LIKE THIS GUY AT SCHOOL
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> it doesnt matter how old you are now.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> there aren't any websites shawty, you have to figure the dude out for ur self aiight
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> I'm a Christian, so maybe I should try singles or youth groups?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> If your a Christian and has a bible read this.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> im sure it can ... if the dream is not something unusual like meeting peter pan
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> conttact me @ effieakamuffin@yahoo.com if u need more advice

<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> How would you like it if they were good looking and thats all they talked about?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> And that person is the one you spend the rest of your life with.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Show off ur Money, if u have....    u will get GF's easily like ur underwear...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> But rember don't take any big jumps.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> it shouldn't matter what sex the person you love is!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> The 3rd time she stated that I promptly told her, Fine!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Thats what I do, though if I like any girl, I approach her and ask her out.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> That is like saying a man with a large penis is a good lover.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> Well, you just need to tell her.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_25> Should I move on or Wait?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> ask her why she did that and then you make up your desicion.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Definately is not easy, but is well worth it!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> why not its a great work out
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> if he doesnt then thats a judgment call 4 u
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Well only if she thinks he's the ONE for her...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I have pictures of my mom kissing my tiny little head.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> love hurts sweetie and you got nothing to prove that he won't hurt you again.so, let him go.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> IMO - I think it's fine.

<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> best way to get over insecurity.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> My advice, don't say a word to her husband.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> think about the qualities u like in a person thats the key
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> then you call her and ask if she tried to call you yet.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> If you dont feel ready to tell your boyfriend that you love him just dont.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> how about....talking about him and be the person he wants you to be
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> yeah to say there is would be racist.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> follow ur heart.get to know her better maybe shes not that bad who knows ask her friends
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> if he'll still glance at the gay man.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> How ever you both have to want to fix the problems.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> i too lost both of my parents but they passed beause of illness.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> Try to end it bieng friends at the least.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> oh yeah you can tell if she likes girls by.........
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> she is a mystery isn't she?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Because all guys just want to bust a nut and it doesn't who with.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> faint heart never won fair lady.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Then again if she is ugly forget about both of them.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> If it is Im really bad.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> Tell her you hate it and won't stand for it anymore.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> i have times, when, i swear, women are just throwing it at me as i walk down the street.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> b. go back to her with my tail between my legs?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> no it is not wrong at all, it is totally natural.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> or you're the one looking one for him?
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_25> and so on and so on.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_20> Otherwise I like to get Basketball Tickets!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> And I love travel too, though haven't done much yet.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_30> not if you dought yourself girl
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> if you find out what a woman wants, please let me know!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> If she meant no then it's no.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> )ACTING A CERTAIN WAY WHEN HE REALLY ISN'T LIKE THAT CAN BE A NUMBER OF REASONS.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> his clothes does not matter at all.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Let me get some thing straight here.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> If you need to yell and scream, just leave.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> i got married in august, not to hot or to cold and i had an outdoor wedding
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> However if your in love...USE A CONDOM!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> someone please help me because i am truely torn.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_10> TO ME IT IS JUST BEING YOU IF YOURE PUSHIE HE'LL FEEL LIKE YOUR SOMETHING YOUR NOT
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> We've desensitized sex so much that just hanging out seems lame by comparison.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> Tell her, girls like to her the truth GOOD LUCK
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> Why marry to only find out they are lame in bed?
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_25> look no more, your crush is here!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> if she chooses johnny depp(which she will) obviously shes not fruity!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> so whoever it is your just gonna have to flat out ask her what she ment by it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Or in one nike sneaker and one brown shoe with non-matching socks?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> my friend even yelled at me and gave me a hour lecture because of it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> i play football with all the guys at my school !!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> my daddy, because he has taught where to set my standards for life.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> if she says no, then you dont have to feel bad or wonder what's wrong with you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Civ 4, netflix, once in a while I go out to eat.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> even lust or love.... it's good to start with a kiss...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> i don't think you should worry about it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> that is the worst that can happen.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_15> NOTE: DO WHAT YOU WOULD WANT YOUR BEST FRIEND TO DO TO YOU!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> true love will take time dont be drawn in to fast by lust
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> (I guess my ex-wife didn't see it that way.)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> What the heck is that about?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> He says they do other stuff, but I don't ask for detail!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> YOU CAN'T MAKE ANYBODY TRUST YOU, SHE HAS TO SEE THAT FOR HERSELF THAT YOU ARE A TRUSTWORTHY PERSON.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> So time isn't really the problem!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> Boys are dumb.. just face it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> if that doesnt work go to zabasearch.com?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> tell him that you don't want to kiss him until you marry him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> yes i would just because they have a disability doesnt mean and thing there a human to
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> are somethings truely better left unsaid or what????
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> (be careful of hubby tho, this is a bad issue)Good luck.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> well they're in laws...so make ur husband do it, it's his family
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> IF WE CAN DO IT SO CAN YOU
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Then you can make love all you want!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> (by the way, he has no girlfriend and he's not gay)
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> if ur ugly, then dont tho
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Don't waste your time on him, he isn't worth it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> I just answer this 'cuz I'm Vietnamese too.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> Men don't usually marry sheep because sheep can't cook.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> Tell her you aren't her safety net.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_10> YOU WANT MORE BUT YOU ARE AFRAID SHE WILL NOT SEE AS THE BOYFRIEND TYPE.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> There is a HUGE difference between just sex and making love!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> Either you are in love or you are sick
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> Simply tell him that you need a little bit longer...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> i feel you on that one thats what ive been wondering
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> it just when we try sex he has these problems and we are both gettin frusterated.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> escort her into the bathroom,& tell her you'd love to take a shower together.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Why would a guy do something like that?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> when u feel like going out of the way n helping this person.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> but what if there's no one there to talk to u?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> Oh and another thing, don't put yourself out there for a guy who is not interested in you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Then we don't know that we almost hurts someone ...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> go for it if hes flurting with u u have nothing to lose
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> your true love will fond you!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> make a separate email account in yahoo
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> No matter what you do someone has to cheat it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> simply ask if he would like to hang out sometime and give him a phone number.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> You just can't forget the whole thing.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> How to get out of it?
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> hmmm....  4 me longest 1 month.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> BE A GOOD BOY AND RESPECT AND BELOVE anayone!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> but U got to keep looking or U'll never know.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Or should I just get over it?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> if you used it to get $100.00 in change, i would say you've made a profit ;-)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> WHY DO WOMEN GIVE MEN A BUNCH OF CRAP ABOUT PORN?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> and my mom, shes always nagging me and sumtimes i hate her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> JUST TELL HER THAT YOU NEED TO TALK TO HER AND LET HER KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT HER.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> just to see what they get and to get the satifaction that they can get a gurl turned on
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> and you will be happier with this one!
<NbChars_35> <LevSim_20> not for me main is 4 in chese is thise big         ........................................

<NbChars_215> <LevSim_30> because you might find he is wonderful.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> im not sure whether he feels 'good riddance' or whether he still cares for me.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> I mean, I love parties too but he shouldn't take it to extreme.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> So keep on trying .. there's a whole world of nice people out there
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> C'mon i mean, lets be real.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Then a guy might come around.But dont rush yourself to get a bf.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> If you love him then yes i would give him a second chance.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Gee, I have a CRAZY idea!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> or maybe he doesn't want a girlfriend right now.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> Some are scared of rejection,... some are just PIMP WANNA BES!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> performace anxiety get married and it just might clear up.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> hell yes would you want someone to ask your wife out
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> Ask a girl out, or get a hooker.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> who knows you mite decided you dont love him as much as u thought he did after it.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> Treat her almost like one of the guys.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Well if it was me, I would go where women who like women hang out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Hi I'm a gal, and have brown hair!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> When I married, I married for life.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> but white girls come across as easier.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Now if it is a woman that may not like women, then get her drunk :) lol
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> since their marriage its been almost 2years - Now, they are having problems.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> say your sorry thats all you can do
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Ok, women need to be romanced.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Only she's liked him since freshman year.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> gurls luv funi guys so iif ur funii then ur half way there!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> you can just treat him right..
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> when she came home from work she smelled like i don't know what.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> if you look you will run into alot of dead end roads!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> yes, its a very strong word if some one belives you when u tell them i love you.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> love is the answer i mean if you loved the persen would you want them doing what your doing
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> never change who you really are.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Three: if he licks his lips alot near you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> u would know if he tells u that he love almost all the time.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> i've done it 5 times in the course of a night.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> oh, buddy..  it's SO not right!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> wake up both of you it might save a lot of problems .
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> are there signs or something that shows a man that shes diggin him or what?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> sry i cant help you with this question but i can say dont give up.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Is he OCD (obsessive compulsive) on stuff???

<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> I want to have sex after marriage.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> there are a million ways of making a girl feel special.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> I LOVE YOU, and don't you forget it..  send him FLOWERS to the house not work....  and so on..
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> All I want is a list of places my boyfriend and I can go.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> don't invite him over and don't ask him what he wants to do
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I just know if I love the person that I am with then it seems to be GREAT!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> But you cant be satified because you banged some guy that was bigger.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> He is the cutest thing  ever!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Run, don't walk to a marriage counselor!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> People are just people; no getting around it, I guess.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> You say he's been like that for 20 years???
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_15> DO YOU WANT TO HANG OUT?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> of couse woman enjoys sex it depends on how good the sex is
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> But beleive me it makes it that much better !
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> YOu dont like him so let him no how u feel.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> (or stuff one at a time)
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> what do you really have to lose?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> AND BE SURE THAT IT'S CONSENSUAL!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> no cuz age aint nothin but a number
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> now if you think it is a bad idea, then follow this adviice.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> {{ SHAKE SHAKE }}  The outcome is unclear...  {{ SHAKE SHAKE }}  That is very unlikely
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> but deep down, i still luv her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> definately not our bodies were designed for sex so why not love i do i love it a lot
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> I think u don't really want any of them, wait for number 3!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> or does she accidentally touch ur hand n then smile?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Ask her if you can FUCK HER UP HER NICE TIGHT SWEET ASS!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> me you what is your age I need a boyfriend
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> Nope just you ;)  Oh, and I see Uber_wise_James too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i didnt get married to get divorced.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> EITHER OR IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE MOOD THAT YOU ARE IN WHEN YOU CLOSE THE DATE
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> now she trys to be nice but it is so hard to forget what she did.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> consider yourself lucky my mom didn't care and it took me many years to learn how to be happy
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> just marry a billionaire so that you can make him a millionaire
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> lose all of your inhibitions......be wild
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> But you have to do what you have to do.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> now my ssecond one is one of the meanest person on the face of the earth .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> let them work it out on their own.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> How about not talking and getting a life !
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> and see where you need work.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> i dont think a 18 year old should be going out with a 23 year old
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> That is if shes not pissed at you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Show up late on the wrong day?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> But hey, what's in a name, eh?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> when girls tries to domiante a man it attrats the most
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Because he is guy who can not see any better
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> rehurse it the day before & just ask her questions & talk to her
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> You aren't, you are a little gray egotistical box.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> i would talk to him or ask a friend of his if he likes u
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> i hate to tell you this but...... u dont  never look back
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> chocolate every woman loves chocolate i mean i do, and maybe some flowers like a rose.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> baby look you is not resonsible for nothing that has your name on it .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> and all your love with a sweet smile and huge.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> The part about him saying he has no son.... well, putting it nicely...he's a butthole!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Take her out to a casino!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> first find a girl near about u and try to make her girlfriend ok
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> me and my family usually get along.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> You can't go back, that's like staying at your job after they fired you!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> SOONER OR LATER IT WILL BREAK AND HE WILL BE HURT MORE THAN IF YOU JUST TELL HIM.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> If she doesn't want you to tell him then you shouldn't.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> im a guy and i think you be honest with him and he should respect that
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> No stings attached - just sexy mail, from someone you've never seen... Yah, sunds good!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> Ask if you could join in.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> she doesnt really act like she cares for the friendship
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> if you feel you must...then you dont need to be married!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> usually his di ck on her a.s.s
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> don't pick one guy and stick with him unless you're sure about it, because that's not fair to him.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> just say  it plain to him guys are like that
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> if you feel you must...then you dont need to be married!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> usually his di ck on her a.s.s
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> don't pick one guy and stick with him unless you're sure about it, because that's not fair to him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Some girls are ugly as blondes but i like brunettes better
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> just say  it plain to him guys are like that
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> Tell him you love him but if they think you don't you can't change it!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> Taboo is more fun, so better make some normal things taboo, or they won't be fun 8)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> something maybe on thier mind or they may not like you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> So tell them quit hating and go find their own.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> And some of them are thinking of the kids too.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> You read that they actually get caught less than guys do?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> She just may very well just like quickies like she says!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> leave him and get wit me
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> use a cock ring you can get them most sex shops.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> And, remember DO NOT go back to him!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> lost love years ago no relief no recovery still have that same love to give to another
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_20> r u a girl , age......... reply me , atleast answer something to my question
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> What the hell is wrong with some of you all?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> would it be ok if youre girlfriend cheated but just for sex?duh!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> try not to hang on with him or his friends,go out,do different things i don't know try new things
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> home made baby it has to hot and fresh.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> So i'm sorry but, i gotta do it.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> you cant tell til u see it for yourself
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_25> You guys need to get a grip.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> but someone trys to tell you and you don't listen.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> If you meet someone great, heck yeah!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> How u love him or her?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> I owuld dump her if it was me
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> i have a bipolar friend and i like him what do i do
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> But as girls mature, they realize that bailing your boyfriend out of jail is not a good thing.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Then I heard a voice saying Sure, here you go.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> If she has to ask you, then drop it.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> So persist on her going with u, convince her how cool it's gonna be and stuff.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> wow you are 26 pretty and really sweet then really i am bad luck that i cant meet you....
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> Most older men like honest women.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> Hey ya ever in Charlotte, Nc shoot me a email, dinner or coffee my treat.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> methinks if she's being so shy that means she digs you.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> I bet he is looking for you too!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> its the perfect kiss if its the perfect person.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> So still be friends with him, but let him know upfront thats all just friends...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> She turned around and looked at me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> She confronted him and he ended up leaving her for the other girl!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> if u r in love or emotionally involved with some one then there is a telepathy between the two.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> Don't get me wrong though, divorce sucks.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> starting with her lips, move down to her neck...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> If not, then you are OK for oral.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> !No, are you seriously asking this question??
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> her, but whatever you do don't do it face to face.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> nope sorry can't help you...already married but their may be some takers
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> because you can have respect without love, but you can't have love without respect.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_95> Act the way u always act.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> eww what kind of question is that?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> skinny hot girls have self-esteem problems which makes them vulnerable .
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> THAT ALONE WOULD MAKE ME STRONG WILLED TO SAY NO WAY!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> probally a whales....maybe a giant squid...*snickers*
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> i should have cheated   trina and kelly,thats a good song lol
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> move on theirs other fish's in the sea.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_45> you will feel it  in your heart
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> I did not cheat and never will.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> I can't believe you have to actually ask this question.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> i have heard it was the flicker lol
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> 10 points for her brain 10 points for her body 10 points for her availability
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> Well, maybe you should be a lil more flirty.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> YOU DONT NEED WORDS TO SAY YOUR BEAUTIFUL OR I LOVE YOU ITS IN THEN EYES AND SOLE
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> i believe in love at first site...  cuz i experienced it.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> because you wouldn't care if they go judgemental on you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> DON'T USE YOUR CAPS LOCK KEY.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> She just has to love you back.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> if u beleive n listen to ur dreams then for u telepathy is a truth n not a myth.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> it might mean that she's just kidding around and maybe that's her way of flirting!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> no, that's why they call it love at first sight
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> hmmmmm good question.....I cannot wait to see the answers to this one!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> You don't owe the girlfriend anything!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> go for it but be damm careful (bring condoms)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> Once you start hitting off well while flirting, sit on his lap or something.
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_35> Ask yourself if you really care.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> I like to get kids veggie tale videos.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> Just be kool and ask her be4 someone else gets her sweetie.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> i just have a wondering eye.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> i just want a man who cares for me and not just for sex.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_20> Just don't push it and just go with the flow.......if there is one?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> I'VE HAD THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM FOR A LONG TIME.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> and attracting him , and do what he likes ,
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> if he's got a girlfriend, your a little late.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> how are you in love with someone you dont even know?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> WHY DO MOST GUYS THINK THEY CAN USE OR MANIPULATE WOMEN?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> but don't let him talk you in toanything you don't want to do.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> punch him in the arm and run a way... that will really get his attention!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> but u don't have to suffer because of him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> You are a lady killer my friend!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> She'd go to be with me instead of saying how boring it was.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> live him alone and go out with me
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> you have to realy know what too do.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> I'm not a girl, but let me just tell you that I totally sympathize!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Is it that he really loves you too?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> .. not the [posessed humans]..there just weak.spiritualy.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> We have only talked twice before...)
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_25> no but get to know them
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> no he may have a big problem at the moment.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> Will a hefty trash bag 39 gallon help ya?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> there are lots of things to discover.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> Do you call him a lot several times so he would not think it was a big deal?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> if not then you either can get the proof and go to her or don't say any thing.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> say he has a small dick (man part)  shut em up so fast
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> it might just be a man thing to stroke his ego
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> what is ur messenger id, so we can chat
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> I f you do not get the worst, alright!

<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> If you WANT to have sex with him, yes.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> and what if he is one of your good friends?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> never do anything you don't want to just because they want to .
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> some women want sex with no strings attatched too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> To be Honest with you there is no wrong choice in the matter (If you don't have a heart!!)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> you guys are having lunch, then your in bed a few days later with this guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> she's looking for a perfect moment for you 2 do that.

<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> some gay guys let and like for men to use them.

<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> i suggest you keeping going at your game
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> Keep zippers shut and legs crossed.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> I think you are the biggest penis in the world
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> a time when she isn't going to explode, etc.).
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> some girls think small penises are cute
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_35> I didn't know you used Yahoo!
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_45> Probably not right away but she'll know.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> its called oops lets not tell anyone about that one
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> because their parents didnt learn them right things
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> First thing I gotta say is how old is he?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> Now adays those that do stay home are internet addicted.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> always having cell phone within her reach at all times, and freaks if you go near it.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> You have to be yourself and be mature!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> right now a guy between 17-25 is in his prime that means he needs it all the time!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> You want HIM to ask YOU out again.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> Don't let him have his cake and eat it to!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_10> think about it and be very careful.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_15> u have to wait and see.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_15> if we drank alot 2 hours.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> And dont care about any other
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_10> BUT HE SHOULD HAVE DISCUSED THIS ISLAM ISSUE WITH HIS PARTNER IN LIFE, HIS WIFE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> But go ahead and try if your that desperate.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> can i ask you a question?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> Ok......just my own opinion mind you.....but here goes:  Lust seems to be purely physical.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> what kind of clothing do i look for
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> My Mom was twenty-five when she got pregnant with me & my dad was twenty-seven.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Where on earth did you get that?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> and maybe try to kiss him on the cheek first.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Guys, believe it or not, have feelings too!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> YOU WANT THAT PERSON IN UR SPACE.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Yes, I think so because many people just are in closet!
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> some women are never on time.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> If anything is telling you no, then dont do it.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> Its like your very own harem!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> maybe shes not the right one and theres someone else for the both of you....that would be my answer!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> do you think he just want ass.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> which one do you love more?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> just come out and say just what you just said.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> i wonder if you can call this love.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Miami, it's hot and everybody's sexy....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> I think that all guys do that even if they say they don't.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Sweeti - you can't MAKE anyone love you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> they start loving you the way you are?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Be her friend first and foremost!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> for the same reason that some people like chocolate ice cream and some people like vanilla.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> ivonne is my cusion and greg is the guy
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> U find girl with small hoo hoo.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> you dont want a phony relationship.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> i think guys do like tomboys.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> it is fun to do it to
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> because your heart does not know the difference between same sex and opposite sex.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> i would say, however, that women are no better.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> u mean on the computer or with webcam?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> So why not make it a date in the place where you first met?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> hi u seem ok but what do u realy look like
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Lots of ways to discover your mate here.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> many man r just stupid and they want to play with you they r just jerks(Answer my questions 2)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> but its good to be the leader once in a while...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Then, I read the other's answers and thought they had a point too.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> these days i think it is like on cuz it's krazly given to/by everyone
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_55> u will know that true feeling
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> neema seem so u forgot to ask the question...ok...
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> The fact that she is keeping it for just one guy only is a big thing!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> most important,do u like her mind?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> he loves u more than that.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> It's best you don't go out with guys who want you just for your looks!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Gotta see both sides of the story.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> DO you like him, if you do just talk to him and stuff.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> More concerned  about what he thinks your not giving him emotionally then mad .
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> Let us know how it goes!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> It would be nice if I havent heard of that poem once before!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> don't jack off because it inhibits u
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Yes my bf cheats on me i got total proof and he still denys it
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> you cheated just to have sex?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Maybe he likes u he will notice u and ask u out.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> 1 time, baby number 2 was on the way.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> If you don't ask you'll never know
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> find a quiet place where both of you are comfortable at.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> well, i was heartbroken when i found out my exbf was cheating on me.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> u shouldn't care about the women or anything.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> how long have u guys being going out?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> If he actually CARES about you then he will slow it down.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> Act like this (*^#(^)#($&_(@#&@)( Just Kidding...  Act unimpress but very interested in things he do...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> when we spoke he told me he was working, and couldn't call me back.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Just pull her to the side one day and tell her how you really feel.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> people are afriad of things they don't understand.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> i hope they all find out.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> Then follow it up with ARE YOU STILL HAPPY WITH ME?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> I dont want to be so someone's sugar mama!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> well i think romantic dinner and then party or honey moon
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> most girls are very shy and they need a little push so as for them to roll with you.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> no offense, but that is a dumb question.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> i thought it would push people away, but wouldn't you know it guys thought it was sexy.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> I think it's because they like penis.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> THE ANTICIPATION WILL BUILD ON HER END.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> u should say something to him if he wont say anything to you
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> they've only met a year ago.. and to my surprise..she chose that girl!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> But don't make it overly obvious either.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> I just don't know how to tell if he likes me or how to get him to notice me
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> But then I'm getting to the point where I'm in the middle between 27 and 60, LOL
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> we never fight and we see each other every chance we get
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> you cant do that if you didnt know you were doing it in the first place.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> do him a favor, go out with him to  applebees and say you need to go to the restroom.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> What steve wrote; I second that!
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_35> do you think I should wait_???
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> but she shud b wise enuf not to land her in a soup.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> It is a good feeling though, it makes life more interesting...have fun!
<NbChars_255> <LevSim_25> money diamonds and jewelery homeboy  i know cause my gurl loves all that junk
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_20> after a couple of months.. ?
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> you cant just make urself popular!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> No, I don't believe that it is wrong.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> Tell him if he loves you he will wait.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Its  a good thing--I love to feel that way!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> love has many reasons that reasons cannot reason
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> but if he doesn't want, don't force him too much.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i dont have a husband but if i did i would be furious!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Maybe that's just who they've fallen in love with.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> it just hits you thats all that happens
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> What can we do thats fun, and cheap?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I don't!-I let her make the first moves, then take it slow/go from there.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> FAMILY IS MORE IMPORTANT BUT MAYBE YOU SHOULD TELL HER SHE IS BEING REALLY   REALLY SELFISH.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Don't go into debt for your wedding!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> i've tried freezing a spoon and lay it on the hickey!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> If you don't mind it, then go with the flow.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> i need more details which kind of love ?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> and i clean up quite will so ive been told , lol
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> theres other things to worry about
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Just do all you can to make things well with her again.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> it really doesnt matter, just find the right guy and make sure its the right time!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> that's what i tell people who ask this questions.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> first of all why was he in jail for?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> chocolate with mint (those are seriously good).
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> you might get a 15 year old telling you she`s 30
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> IF NOT, TELL HIM YOU LOVE HIM BUT THAT YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH HIS D O GG Y STYLE
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> maybe, but i look at a lot of guys all the time, even though i have a boyfriend.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> take one day at a time.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> No, it's with the one you hate the most.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> we like to hear that too!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> I hate dumb girls that are arrogant like hell.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> can u show ur face & Id ?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Just believe me when I say that your my cutie pie.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> And other men don't do this?
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_30> use a lie detector, just kidding!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> And tell her that sh_t won't cool .
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> I myself do it while i am with my hubby.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> whomever u feel most attracted to just tell them how u feel.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i know u want to have any experience, but u will regret it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> If you say you love him too and are lying you are making a big mistake.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> we just don't want you to notice that we notice.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> He says,I'm mad, I'm going drinking.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Beliveve me I don't but let me tell u about something that happen At school.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> coz the stranger doesnt even care a bit about you!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> i guess thats what they mean when they say love at first sight.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> THINK OF TIGER WOODS AND HIS WIFE.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> he tells me he's so lonely and he misses me.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> i am a girl and i think confidence wins guys over if they are smart anyway.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> and i dont usually remember too much!

<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> you have to talk to him yourself and tell him you like him!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> If he really likes you he will make the first move
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_30> RUN as fast as you can!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> that depends i could give you suggestions but i couldnt promise they would work.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> do women actully go 4 this just random and never c him again
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> u cant neglect a GM .........
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> when are you going to move on?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> I know I love her, I can't wait for my fist slap,thats love, aint it?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> um, yeah, try a ziploc bag.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> toys i recommend the power glove!!!!!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> We love those bad boys don't we.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> and listen to your heart (not other people) but, keep logic close to your heart.........
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> my ex gf is marrying the wrong guy  ...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> i waited until i was almost 19, and the guy was a total jerk.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> She does not love you  she wants a puppet.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> i need to look for his personality and the passion he has for me or else for get it!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> when his pals arrived, he introduced me like, that's my girl diane.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> ME AND MY FRIEND TRIED IT FOR LAUGHTS, AND LAUGHS WAS ALL IT WAS GOOD FOR!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Its about adoring it for what it is......good, bad and ugly.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> How i feel so good with dating and have fun a good time without my boo!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> eye contact, and time spending w/ u
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> just take it easy and relax.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I am in love right now.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I don't think that's how it should be.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> I also know some girls went to prom without a date...and thats cool too!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> But you could make it longer!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> And am done and over with that too.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> Remember: 1.this will most likely bite you in the butt later.2.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> I AM SICK OF GETTING THOSE FATTY GIRLS AT CLOSING TIME AT THE BAR THAT DON'T TURN YOU DOWN.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_35> Yeah, I feel the same way.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Well you can't trust girls as friends or as people you just talk to.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> The ones I know won't just say it.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> but sometimes drunk if u wanna spunk thing up
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> I agree some women do like quickies.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> being a Friend means being with them in both good and bad times.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> plenty, depends what kind of relations do you mean
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> now that isnt to say that I dont have problems....just different ones.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> But it's like, now that she is with him she never wants to chill with me anymore.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> now i havent tried to contact him in 2 days.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_10> And keep in mind that YOU DESERVE HAPPINESS!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> !If you wpould like more advise...Email me @ meow3994@yahoo.com!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> just bite ur lip and say it.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> Plenty of other nice looking DECENT men out there who have brains bigger than a walnut!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Its not bad to fantasize no matter how extreme.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> i dont know...maybe he will like that type of thing...flattery.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> Now, I don't know what to do.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> be thankful that she sees all this stuff and yet she is still with you
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> And if you like the other 6 words holler @ me if you like.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> A long time ago I saw Ricky Martin dancing on TV.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> Or maybe you just haven't found the right man yet.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> But theres another part that tells me if i say yes he would jump @ the chance.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> probably drunk but i couldnt really tell you because when i get drunk i get wasted!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> if you are not willing to wait then you should break up with him.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> It's sort of like a bruise.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Are you sure they're really girls?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> he'll be so blown away that you'll get whatever you ask for...
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> the most i ever got was 7 hours.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_10> i think its only you who could answer that.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> the guy purchases for the girl and and the gal gets one for the guys thats what happens here
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> Im goin through the same thing.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> im kool wit my X. soem ppl rnt though
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> stay with your boy!and tell the other boy your sorry!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> none as long as they are legal age
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I guess you don't put ketchup on your eggs either?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Tell her you don't want any commitments.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> just kidding about the last one, please don't.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> I just dont know what to do.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> It really dont matter if he likes someone else.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> yes i have ached for someone
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If it's mutual, then you're both simply nymphomaniacs gettin' yer freak on!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> wow which country ur from where there is no fools
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> women are just as bad as men if not worse because their better at it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> someone who truly loves you will respect u...so i guess respect is more important in a way...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> yeat its real, but when you young, you just have crashes thats it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> why a married man goes to a hotel with a girl who is engaged?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> bc fighting is part of marriage and if you got through this one you can make it!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> you are very sexy and hot.i would like to date with you
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> do you think people choose to be gay or lesbian because it's fun?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> i get more offers because i'm with someone,other girls see that dedication and want a piece of it.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> If your food can't be eaten, well just call for a pizza delivery!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> don't get too caught up because he was a perfect gentleman for that 1 night .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> definitely sober, although a little tipsy is pretty awesome too!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> If he said yes then u have ur answer but if he said no... hard luck girl...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> active your boyfriend sexually as possible
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> BUT DON'T RUSH RIGHT INTO SEX W/ HER AFTER THE KISS.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> First he will look at u more than any other girls.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> As stats show they get caught lesses than men
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> rock on you got any pic's or home movies?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> I play hard to get i guess..
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_40> Does he have alot of money?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> you can get them in all sizes.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> I strongly believe in virginity... not just because I'm a Christian...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> If I got to be 27 again, heck yeah!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> Men don't have as much to worry about.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> But she got eventually got pregnant.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> no difference at all(except of hair color)
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> If he's lying, dump his sorry ass.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> well just clik on that face in ur messeges thing
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> It is good to have sex with one who loves you also
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> how about she is board and she want to dance.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> THE PEOPLE THERE ARE CRAZY LONELY AND THEY GO THERE CAUSE THEY THINK THEY CAN IMPRESS SOMEBODY WITH CONVERSATION!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> sign up for a dating service
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Why else did you get a hickey on your neck?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> sex lots and lots of it
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Dear let me our marriage date ok.......LOL
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> You will know it ... by her eyes!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> And then see how he feels about you!
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_40> wow... depends on how strong she is and how strong you are guys are.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> If he was THE ONE, I'd still want him to quit.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> just getting to know someone doesn't have to lead to more.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> and ask her to dance too!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> honestly...some gurls dont want to embarress themselves.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> he sitll feels the same but u don't
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> when you care about everything she/he cares about and you don't want her/ him to get hurt
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> stay in your marraige unless someone is causing physical pain.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> no unless its your mom or sisters not girls in general.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> work 55 hrs a week to occupy my mind.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> well since you waited 5 years wait till they break up.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> You dont ask her at all.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> well im my opinion you may say :  boyfriend: I love you!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> though truth really hurts, but your boyfriend needs to move on.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_20> if that is the case forget him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> She is so hot, i had a huge crush on her like forever
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> I almost peed myself watching that movie!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> well, if you love your boyfriend then you will have to sacrifice the other boy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> Then ask your self how old is he?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> But download it you'll see what I mean
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> They teach kids stuff as they are having fun!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> for some people it is love at first site.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> It is hard bc u can't see them all the time
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> i do i think it's wrong when some don't b/c they find it wrong.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> I don't think so... No one can control me
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> we talk alot about just about anything.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> 2. there to stupid to know which hole to stick it in.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> and my second husband had the same thing.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> seems like he doesn't even know what he really wants... :/
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Even a shy guy will nod his head yes or no.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> What you mean is do guys like ugly girls with zero feminity?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> could u know that you love someone right off the bat?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> smile at him..  let him catch you looking at him ... maybe wink at him then look away.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> yes and no  it depends on the actual situation  has she seen you before and likes you ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> because most fat girls are ball busting bitches with too much self confidence .
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> Tell him to get over it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Is strongly liking someone somewhere around twice your age a bad thing...?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> Some but not most thats wrong and discusting unless ur ugly
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> It hurts some women to the point that they won't have sex with him, while others love it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> and sometimes it is just to dance.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Girls like that sort of attention.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> But its not my kind of thing
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> some girls take advantage of nice guys.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> the man is married, and i have a boyfriend.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> but my private is too smaller than you..isn't it..?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> I have a leather whip at home...never used it though...lol.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> and it puts the ball in his court for the next move :) good luck
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> If you are just hanging out, then you shouldn't.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Have a schlong like Tommy Lee.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Hey, I have an idea... ask your mom.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I just which it was the ever way around.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> he always promise to do things that he know he will never do.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> it keeps you from having kids befor you need them.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> I know it sounds sappy, but it works!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> make out with classy guys that wont vampire your neck
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> my suggestion is that you just keep finding ways of talking to him.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> Aren't you laying it on a little thick?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Are we playing 20 questions, this could be fun, LOL
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> he is so sxy you like him more than everybody
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> oh, and always best, make the first move, we think its really sweet!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> but i dont know how to tell him or even if i should???
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> But for you it may be diffrent!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> lol...atleast you have the balls to ask...umm...read up on some kama sutra..it teachs you how...it works too.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> I don't think there is any one killer bullett!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> leave that to a doc or someone else.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> OMG, what else could we read here?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> He makes fun of you,bugs you,and hangs out with you
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> Yes, cheating is wrong, no matter what.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_10> SO I DO NOTHING AND STAYING WITH HIM BUT CAN'T BELIVE THAT HE LIE ON ME!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Don't be afraid to ask your partner what he likes, or to tell him what YOU like!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> What the best you do can about that...?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Do I tell her (I think she might be interested)?Or do i leave it alone.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> No matter how long your in a relationship now.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> because they dont think with their heads they think with their d icks!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> Good luck and Happy Birthday to your brother!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> that she wants to dance... duh...lol well, it could honestly mean a lot of things.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> WHY does he keep calling me telling me he misses me???
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> I find men with self confidence to be sexy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> DONT FORGET TO CHOOSE AND VOTE FOR BEST ANSWER!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> could downgrade her see here here and there and date others.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> you do not want to see your gf cry
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> I don't think it matters, really.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Only thing is that girls date for relationships and some guys don't.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> don't just keep silent pretending you are happy in this relationship.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> try to know if he really loves u or not.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> (just until you're ready to give it to him)........ mmmmmmmmmmmm  messed up i know,  but it's the truth.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> If I didn't like to be with them I wouldn't.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> i mean be wise,clever and careful and dont get laid into traps.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> if that doesn't work, then have a mutual friend (who KNOWS) to explain it to her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> yeah.absolutely.did something stupid too to fulfill it.ahhh.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> - You can't imagine your life without him/her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Even though it doesn't or never did belong too them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> just take it slow, you dont have to marry the guy tomorrow!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> he later asked me, do you mind if we cuddle?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> (and kiss him in some corner if all goes well.)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> do u think he will call me after it happens.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> But for my money, I find brunettes a lot more attractive.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> TRUST ME IT ANINT WORTH IT.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> i agree with all this answer and i can't tell anything bec they tolled u every thing
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> not just a chat room but a dateing site.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> hell probly start looking 4 some1 who will love him.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> But white man don't love black women.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> I'll give 'em the message for ya ;-)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> u have to earn ur way up there.. be nice to everyone!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> GOOD LUCK AND I HOPE YOU FIND THE RIGHT GIRL FOR YOU AND REMEMBER BE MATURE AND BE YOURSELF!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> both, because it would work out better.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> You really don't have to love people, you just have to respect them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> If it was the right guy, you would know
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Does he take you out in public?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> wait until you know how you feel.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> If that person is the one that hurt you the answer is NO!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> IN FORNT OF THE GUY YOU LIKE IN A RAISED VOICE.LET HIM OVER HEAR YOU.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> It gets better and easier, I promise.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Plus you get a tax cut.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> And everyone is stupid about love so ur not just the only one.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_35> I look at behinds, chests, flys ; ).
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> if she really likes you, then she will give you a sign.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> there are plnty of men out there.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_15> IF HE LOVES YOU IT'LL SHOW.
<NbChars_395> <LevSim_15> how do i get a girl??
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Or a special dinner at a nice restaurant.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_10> Oh you meant sex RULES !
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Girl why did u say no?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_10> MAYBE U JUST NEED TO TRY TO WORK YOUE PROBLEMS OUT INSTEAD OF LEAVING ONE ANOTHER.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> tell him...maybe he feels the same way and is afraid to bring it up.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Is it ok for your hubby to play golf when he feels like it?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> we had some lone time ourselves so we just chat.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> but you just have to do it while youre under their roof.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> AFTER TWO MORE MEETINGS W/ HER DO THE SAMETHING, BUT GO FURTHER, CHANCES ARE YOU WILL SCORE.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> If yall have known each other for a while she could just want you
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Never mind what I just said...
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_40> Depends if she's hot or not.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> On one hand our bodies tell us to go, go go!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Tell her that you think its best you both move on.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_20> Experience is nice in women too :)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Break alls coz you are not favour with them
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> 3. look for bunch of dudes talking to each others and choose the guy you like, total freedom!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> everyone wants me for one thing and thats sex.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> Men don't like to loose and having sex is the ultimate goal.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> no whi u luv is who u luv.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> not many excuses here as to what he is doing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Definitely impossible to swallow....but yet they want you to!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> I keep at an arms lenght but he barges in
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> and then, if you can, ask him out to a casual date with friends.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> i hope she/he is cool too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> we have nothing we dont talk about.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> i am afraid that m----- will not be friends with me if i am not friends with b-----.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> It's not an issue of her leaving her husband, more like someone to be friends with...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> i don't have his social life in my face all the time.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> if when he calls & you see its him do you light up?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> !And then you can relaxx and enjoy!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> When he says he Loves You with out saying a word.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> You can't rush love.......and you can't make it exist if its not there.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> He and my cousin had a really nice time at the prom!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> When any girl looks at me like that, (even if I don't like her) I feel flattered.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> but, yeah, he probably likes you.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_15> I THINK IF U LIKE HER AN DSHE LIKES U IT DOSNT MATER
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> I would think you are a ho.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> i feel that i'll be the better option pathania_savvy2000@yahoo.com
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> If you are in a serious relationship now then don't do it.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> so i beleive that u can love someone with out hurt.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> It seems like he's playing with you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> No ring on your finger right?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> And also i like woman who gives me challanges, a woman who is indepedent
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> its when you dream about him and can't picture your life without them.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> What should I do, at my wits end
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> ask him when the next day of school you have off is...lol.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> maybe u are going after the wrong guys and not acceppting the ones that come after you
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Don't pull your wifebeater up and rub your fat belly.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> Best of luck with the guy... And sure he likes u... damn i'm jealous... ;-).
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> I know one guy and thats me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> search in differnt palces  clubs, parties,........
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> lol  girl, there are TONS of guys who dig big girls.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> it takes a lot of nerve, depending on your age, to ask someone to dance, so be nice!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> Just put it all out on the table...what do you have to lose...Gotta take a chance sometime.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> But it matters not what I believe what it is to be.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> then your gonna wanna leave your family and run off 2 cancun with this guy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> And I know it's easier said than done.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> never do it.....for either of you!
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> being overseas is a great opprotunity don't blow it
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_25> good luck, sounds like a match.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> And guess what, I'm a girl.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> But I can't see myself rubbing chest with someone whose got tits as big as mines.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> 2. go to a place where you can find dudes (dudes are everywhere, go anywhere, that's easy!!)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> some gals can really make you crazy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> and you are just now thinking of marraige.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> Once you find it just keep pluggin' away at it--and before you know it YOU'RE COMING!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> no sorry you have no chance only if he wants sex then he will go with you
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> Whoa whoa whoa......That is such a generalization.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_45> depends on how old they are.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> I found her in the newspaper!
<NbChars_255> <LevSim_5> CHALK IT UP TO LEARNING,MOVE ON.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_25> Yes, some guys like tomboys, some don't.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> If the one is an animal, then its no!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> i hope that i help u!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> virginity until marriage won't guarantee happiness through marriage.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Don't play hard to get just yet.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> Quite sour, acidic & tastes yucks!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> you seriously need to check your grammar.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> He's just wrong for doing whatever he's been doing and not buy food, he is just WRONG!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Yes, it's even harder when u can't find them but they're right there.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> My mom is jelaus of my wife.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> u mean come?my girlfriend sez it tastes like eggs, mixed with salt and vanilla.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> 1) by their shoe size 2) on the index finger the distance between the first and second nuckles.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> Hope you'll give this some serious thought before you go there!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> I have to lie to see my (boy)friend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> God's got someone out there for you!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> And if he says no, it's no big deal -- it's just coffee, so it's not embarrising.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Its like torture knowing she'll never be with me
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> im just cool to hang with
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> well, i think that the age where you shouldnt have a child is like 40+.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> And obviously big boobs n a nice a$$.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Go for the goal; don't quit at the halfway point!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> or they dont mind because they also get what they want.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> totally wrong, in my opinion even teens sex is wrong, and adults premarital sex is wrong
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> well first is it your friend or is it you?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> Maybe your stupid for giving them what they only want.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> or is is it that you don't know how to make one?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> I Would have just bit the bullet and said HELL YEAH I'LL BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> But we always want whats not good for us.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> I haven't - if you particularly mean YAHOO!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> I sorry i didn't tell him what i truely felt for him.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_35> Depends on how well your mom knows you.
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_25> I just didn't want him to get the wrong idea
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_30> he proble is cheating on you
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> it has lots of naked people in it.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_35> If you don't, then don't bother.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> get plastic wrap and rubber bands if you're so full of yourself.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> i dont know but id like to know the answer to this ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Say I care about you deeply.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Don't pretend to be somebody just to please us guys.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> if they both really like each other then they could come to an agreement
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> seriously this question is only for guys,  i dont want girls to even read it.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> Word of advice from experience NEVER DATE ANYONE FROM WORK!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Good Luck and keep reminding yourself, 'I deserve better than this jerk.!!'
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> Go for a special ride somewhere.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> They fall in love with everyone they have sex with.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Beautiful women like Pam Anderson marry freaks like her ex-husband.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> guy above me's got the right idea
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> All the ones at Hooters do.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> DO THAT ONE NIGHT,AND LEAVE IT ALONE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> play more between rounds, she will like it also.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> so better get a good grip on it and use it more often!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Hmmm.. Well if you love your boyfriend that much, your fling wouldn't be an issue.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> i think we hit it of straight away.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> I don't love him and want him back.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> i was mad and i yelled at him.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> mabe she dosent push you on things that she would normally be upset about because her mind is preoccupied.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> but it does cause problems in most marriages.. get some professional help..soon
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> if he cares hell under stand
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Humor your friend, get her drunk and you can pick which one u want or both.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> I used yahoo personals to meet my husband!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> hey, how come that u like someone that know you at all??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> unless of course your married, then the only thing for me would be forgiveness.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> I seriously like the name Chris though :-)
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> u don't have 2 change at all.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> it's a kind of a test sometimes
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> why not a guys a guy no matter who he likes plus  you could talk to them about guys
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> the biggest mistake is rushing a woman for sex.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> That doesn't mean he wants to be buddies.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> does he llke me or am i just hot to him?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> If you ask her to have sex and she agrees, then thats what you are looking for!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> your best freind is who youare married to or shuld be
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> Why everybody say only bad about u????
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> 3) Maybe they just dont like you.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> {Hey at least she had the limo}  Lesson:  Don't try to take something you can't afford to loose.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> k everyone calls me either a  blonde or brunette so i can't take sides.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> where's the fun in not showing off your talent?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> be nice to everybody always and maybe the love will return.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> if mentally and phsically able to support there selves.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> just forget that you are shy or not handsome.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> you just answered your own question.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> I don't think so not if he had an affair.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Stay until you know it's over and when you leave, don't go back!!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> you didn't ask for an explanation, did you?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> everyone worked and education wasnt very important
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> if someone didnt respect u then u wouldnt fall in love with them.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> If a girl doesn't like 2 dance then she can't dance obviously.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> 5 days.... and it was a peck on the cheek 1st and i was floored
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> P.S i think she really did give it back to me still.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> Well did he/ she ask him out and he said yes... or what?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> if someone didnt respect u then u wouldnt fall in love with them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> If a girl doesn't like 2 dance then she can't dance obviously.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> 5 days.... and it was a peck on the cheek 1st and i was floored
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> P.S i think she really did give it back to me still.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Well did he/ she ask him out and he said yes... or what?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> U need to find the right man 4 u on ur the 1st time.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> My wife says she doesn't like sex to be long.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> remember, the truth will set you free
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Nobody just stops loving somebody else, even if they say they don't anymore.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Just find the thirst in your guy and have a nice sleep with him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> talk normal with him, just because u like him doesnt mean you can't be friends first
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> but if you think they are youre prob right...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> I believe that is so sick to happen
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_35> and likes that i like sports and has a soft side but a hard side to
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_45> If you set down and talk and they say No do you get angry?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> well the biggest whore i know..she normaly wears jeans, a tee, and a hoodie if its cold out.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> And then you go look for him, which is even playing more into his game.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> you look like a guy...nope I'm not interested
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_50> Do you know any of his exes?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> does it mean she likes you or just want to dance?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> Is your wife actually having the big O during sex?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> If you want her that bad, Sh*t go to the wedding and stop it midshow.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> hum what is the question again?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> because I've seen reports of 9 year olds becoming pregnant.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> A really bad song by Haddaway...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> First get to know him and see what he likes before wondering if likes you!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> i think that if you really love the guy you dont care about the size at all
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> another thing, doing it over the phone or on line is being a coward.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> is it because your friend has had no sex for a year?
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_45> First of all, do you want sex now??
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> let him make up his mind.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> and if he didn't look like a prune and was healthy why not
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> just don't let people take advantage of you.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> So, yeah, it's REALLY hard to deal with.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> try - yahoo personals or americansingles
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> join school finish next level, find better carreers, take a vacation meet me i can use a loyal woman.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> this is the best for a guy
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> If you're a woman: I don't know the answer.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> u can just be like yea being single has its ups and its downs.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_15> YOU ARE TOO GOOD FOR HIM!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Start flirting, and be in control of every step u take ahead in this process...Best of luck!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> yeah email me i like it jk
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> If you're a woman: I don't know the answer.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> YOU ARE TOO GOOD FOR HIM!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Start flirting, and be in control of every step u take ahead in this process...Best of luck!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> yeah email me i like it jk
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> they don't choose to be gay or lesbian.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> you can even send her pictures anonamously if you dont feel comfy telling her in person.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> i think when he kinda flirts with me i really dont know
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> yes i would  if i was in to this person and like them alot i would oh!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Depends if they are good looking or not.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> he just brushed me hair w/ his hand and pat my back gently.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> stop eating twinkies or if you are good looking and have big breastisis then show em off
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> Obviously you loved her once and got married.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> I went out with this guy who out of no where stopped calling me.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> If, you cheat on him then you are truly not the one for him.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> Now he kinda thinks you like him.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> They always fall lor the wrong guy...
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> if you are asking, then you are probally too small.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Like to wear it during sex!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> and if she doesnt do anything about just be there for her when she does find out.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> I dont think that it was worth it in the long run
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> be your self and dont be shy
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> maybe u'll find better guy to love and he'll do the same without leaving u. haha!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> Sure, why not... (that is if you're over 21)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> I was friends with him at first b/c I felt bad for him.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> i like a smart funny an pretty is always a plus
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> Go w/ what your gut says and you will be fine.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> That was a a crazy joke we played yesterday huh?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> bacause ther gay pr a lezbian
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> i would be better if u state ur age !!!!!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Action speaks alot louder than words
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Go window shopping of what you guys want for your future house.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> me myself i would'nt do it, you've only knew him for 6 months.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> seth green, kinda took me a while to notice it though.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> becuase they want to have sex
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> Hmm, yea in both the good and bad way.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> LOVE IS LIKE WHEN U CAN'T STOP THINKIN OF THAT PERSON.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_25> depends whats the catch, sk8r dude wants to know
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Guys hurting grrs, grrs hurting guys.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_40> flirt and look for the cutest
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> fin dthe cool guy and   go around him ...bco'z now a dys pair looks charming than singles
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> yeah, unfortunately i have to admit this generality.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> that is soo wrong, i dont pin her down, but still give ur man some sex!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Are you sure you do not want one ?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> it depends on what he likes
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Snap your fingers at her when you tell her No way girl.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Tell her, and see what happens
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> Acts kinda shy but not really.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> its not worth getting mad over.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> I'm gonna say no, since you seem not to be looking.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> They want you to look like a fool.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_25> holla at me and talk to me about u please!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> well i have been told alot of different way on how to tell.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> I do not even care if she wears it - whatever makes her happy is fine with me.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> but the answer to that is no.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> MOST PRECIOUS GIFT YOU CAN GIVE TO YOUR HUSBAND..
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> not always, but you should exercise caution
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> some ppl do think that, but i don't..
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> even here in canada i reli dont think that they will allow young teenagers to buy a condom.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> You'll look bad if he still has a girlfriend, though.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> IF YOU HAVE TO BE EITHER WHY HAVE IT
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> In my opinion, the biggest penis, (also known as a 'DICK'), is most likely Osama Bin Ladin!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> kiss her thats always a very good start
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> just be yourself around him, and only tell him you love him if he tells you first.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Because come on, once youve had one how can you not like it?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> Move on you dont need him and he dont deserve you.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> three days ago i fell and hurt my ankle.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> Hey speedy, word of advice... Stop now.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> do u think i should go.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> since you have to ask probebly not yours or your mans!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> i called him 10 times and he didn't return my call.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> It is like riding a bike sweetie...you definitely wont' forget how.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_30> (IE: Seeing #2 without #1 knowing.)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> .. i then learned nothing is ever certain, so be careful
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> if you start fooling around with him and it just doesnt feel right stop.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> just give her the tip and if things aren't going alright by that point find someone else
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> why do single men have sex with married women?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> You won't have to worry about it anymore.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> Maybe she loves you in her own way.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> for starters just talk to him why does it seem so hard to talk?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> u can say.... Hey , How you doin!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> hey i guess we all have some wierdness in us !!!!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> I'm smart, fun to be around but nobody likes me
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> depends on eric and his situation
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> So I guess I dont notice.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> if it is your current guy, stick with him and try to forget the other guy.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> Once he even pined me to the bed and said if you love me you will do this.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> fo real girls are gonna read this just cause it tells us not to!!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> NO, they don't like you at all.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> and your di ck stands up and you cannot get it down.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> Tell him that he can't afford you!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> haveing sex while coked up thats the best
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> a girl whith a lot of curves and big boobs
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> If he only interested in sex then you can wait.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> First off: trust what barbnefer has said (this person gives EXCELLENT advice).
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> that's simple give flowers and candy and just be yourself.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> I'd only consider him if he quit.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> First you'd have to define bad marriage.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> Probably always a liar, but not always a cheater.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> so one day i crapped in her shoe .
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> jacket is okay, but leave open.. dont zip it up.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Then if he feels the same way about you ask him if he would like to hang out sometime!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> same with my girlfriend she only gives it when she wants too!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> if you don't use it in a LONG LONG LONG time you will forget it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> ur never gonna get a girl if ur gonna chicken out!!!
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> confront her in a controled way.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> I would do it.GO FOR IT!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> I feel for you my love just had a baby on Thursday .
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> A woman doesn't want a whiny guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> that is a great way to piss off a female quick.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Most i've done is dance w/ one @ a straight club.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> yes to all but being bi...no

<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> When you guys aren't sexin' what's his conversation like?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> If you have a really good guy friend then ask him.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> She just happened to make the mistake of calling one day when she was home...BUSTED!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> think about the way he said it to you and then youll know how he meant it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> Not to be blunt, but I hope you didn't give it up .
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> all i can say is that i moved 1000 miles away.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no it just means you are starting out good
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> You know, the guy always doesn't have to make the first move.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> A lot of girls seem to resist touching guys.

<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> no not at all and sex does not last over time BUT LOVE will
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> My brothers b-day is coming up and i have no idea what to get him.

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> I like Blonde guys...but right now I'm with an orange haired guy
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> or u can just straight up cum of the cut and say im single whats your status?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> some guys might lie to get u in bed and once they do they just forget.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> But always say it with a smile.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> If you want a sure thing though, find a Jewish guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> someone with very sexy clothing and is in heat
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Just be yourself and keep your grades up and in 10 years see who's cool then!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> some girls will do anything for the guy!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> don't keep it for to long - we are getting older
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> definately when it feels right not becuase you feel you should
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> you get to know people the best in casual settings.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> then u discuss the matter later
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> definately when it feels right not becuase you feel you should
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> you get to know people the best in casual settings.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> then u discuss the matter later
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> why sit there and wait for him to see you move on.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> Go join a Bball team or something.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> but u jus have to wait patiently, when the time comes u will have the right one.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> What I do is get evrything as straight as I can.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Be able to put up with ME!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> That depends...what kind of a girl is she?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> u should go out with a guy u like and that likes u back.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> if he is THE ONE, he'd quit for me.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> hey dude... For every ten no's you will get one yes
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> On his neck wouldn't be any different.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> Its been happily aver after since!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> have a romantic dinner, if he still resists then you have a problem.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> never be the first to say it..let the guy do it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> play it easy, and maybe wait a little
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Or they might hate the guy and want to screw his life up.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> use tounge, but PLEASE don't slober all over her chin!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> She means if you want a kiss, just kiss her without letting her know you're going to.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> don;t you want to find a nice girl no matter what she is?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> at first it was getting to know each other and then kissing comes later.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> DO IT  I WISH THE WOMEN IN MY LIFE WOULD HAVE HOOKED ME UP WITH THAT SH!T
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> write single in big bold letters on your forehead...worked for me
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> OMG!..she didn't mind our 9-year-friendship..what will i do??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Hope this helps and isn't too harsh.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> how calm you dont believe him?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> ALSO I GUESS IT WOULD DEPENT ON YOUR HEALTH.GOOD LUCK
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> well it depends on a lot of things.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> but i dont know how to ask him if he wants to give it a second chance.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Love don't Cost a thing  Go out watch it and then get some ideas from there.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> i only know the mean way to say it, but say thanks, haha n smile.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> But, first thing's first, pack up your stuff and LEAVE!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I didn't until you mentioned it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> The younger they are, the more bad boys they want.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> It's like she only talks to me when things are going wronge with her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> if your an adult,age simply should'nt matter
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> add more details what u want to use?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> it worked on my own friend
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Somewhere out there is a guy asking How do I find a wife.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> Day 1 is ok with me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Then you guys can afford more things
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> But if I was him I would not marry ya ether without one.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> WHEN YALL START TALKIN LAUGH ALOT!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> i mean i love the one in jail.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> and it goes as far as my dad did but it took him 15 years to do.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> i would have had enough of him tell me or else!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> In Yuma...... Good luck with that one.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> he's either goin to love you bcuz he loves you or he's not going to love you at all.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> SO its nothing wrong with being friends right after.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Well there should be huh :-) (I AM A GUY TOO) I am pretty sure there would be.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> I not tring to be mean.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> It comes down to too things are you marring him for Love or Money?!?!?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> dont do it .it will only cause problems promise.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> if he really loves u then he wont worry abt sex.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> (you're supposed to be laughing here friends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Diamonds are a girl's best friend : )
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> try being his friend first and see what it leads up to
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> im no expert, but i dont think manual trannys have ecus.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> If you want my oppinion, yes.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> (im a father of 3 little girls and suddenly find myself hating guys)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Just say, hey, what's going on?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> you dont want to do that!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> (A lot of the best ones don't post pictures).
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> sweetie there isn't one there seriously you are so dumb
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> got drunk and had sex with his daughters.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> Maybe if ur in the same school.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> say u love him now and if and when u do u wont b lieing n e more.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Then, go back to the store without him and pick up the one thing he liked the best.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> the most expensive thing was the preacher...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> whatever the fight was about, it's best 2 completely solve, so as not 2 start another fight later on.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Probably because you are pissing him off.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> And if they don't approach you, say hi
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> next time try something like: girls wanna chat??
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> Stuff like that can get someone hurt.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> So if they aren't in tune with you and don't care enough to try then give it up.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> u cant get cool friends u have them !
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> No...not unless you want to walk around confused.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_30> You simply say Hey, what's up?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> !but think before u cum to any conclusion..is it really worth it?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> So go on with your life and if he comes back, then you know what you want.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> My wife gave me oral sex two days after!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> Most guys are bluntly obvious about girls so hang in there
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> i tryed over and over to get her to leave ,she wouldn't.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> click the link below... its not something u can eat i think..
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> no--i try to not have any kind of relationship with them
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> this is mainly for the older folks or the ones who knows there gonna get married.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Don't EVER sh1t where you eat man...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> THIS WILL SHOW HER THAT YOU'RE NOT IN A RUSH.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> Those chocolate with mint kisses are pretty good.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It will always be somewhere in yr heart ...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Don't let people fool you honey!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> lift your head up and carry on like the woman you are!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> and if u must drull, dont let him see u do it.good luck!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> ask a plastic surgeon to make one for you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT, thats f*ckin abvious
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> :)   Now its been 5 years later and we're married!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> But that doesn't mean they don't exist.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> Even if he feels embarassed to talk with you about that issue, hey!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> it was getting late so i fell asleep on his living room.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> Get back together, then dump her.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> don't do it just think about it
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_50> Even better wait til ur married!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> can u stand if she is not good looking?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> your friends are just trying to show you their side, it seems like they already know yours.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Well i would tell you , but that can land me in prison
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> u just have 2 trust in him if u really like him.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Or does he only call when he wants the booty??
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> YOU CAN'T REALLY TELL MOST OF THE TIME
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> oh yeah..if you don't get it out and get it moving it will become moldy and taste really bad
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Or are you like 15 years old
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> It's tough, but hang in there.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_10> THESE DAYS MEN ONLY LOOKS AT TOP AND BOTTOMS OF A WOMEN
<NbChars_250> <LevSim_20> can u do it with me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> its tough for guys that are unexperienced with girls to make eye contact.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> Let's Get It On - Marvin Gaye I'm Gonna Love You - Barry White (forget everything after that)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> A girl should luv U 4 who U R if she don't move on she an't worth it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> THEN FINALY WHEN I TURNED 13 I FOUND THE PERFECT SOLUTION TO MY PROBLEM.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> been there done that from both sides.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> if you think they do, then you are wrong.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> we,both staying in a working women hostel room.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> if ya gotta ask that in here you have serious problems of one sort or another....go see a shrink
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> So your mind is gonna play with you, ya know.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> i don't know what to do, what u think
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> But I couldn't go with her.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> tell him what is going on...all the mundane, boring details!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> Wet it and if it curls add some gel and your off
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_40> yes some but some might not.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> first love is , your first love .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> if youre happy with them, make sure they dont find out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> that depends on how old you are  ... but i say where and when you least expect it
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> i would have to say yes and i know am not the onlyone that thinks that way.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> I go for a guys personality.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> when hes actin diff or always buggin u
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Dog style with high heels on the girl
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> That way if the condom breaks, then it wouldn't be as bad.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> why would you even do that??
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> My advice, is don't start anything your gonna regret later.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> but hey, its not my life.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> i will have in which ever position.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> one minute u could be happy the next depressed and wanting to kill urself.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> not really all people can change no matter what you've done
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> honestly girls are b itches we just use pms as an excuse!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> gal w/ lower grader than the guy is always possible...it's normal
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> first, marry whoever the hell you're going to marry.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> YOU SEE LIKE A SENSIBLE GUY, SO DONT DO IT.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> WHEN HES AROUND,TELL YOUR GIRLFRIEND OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW AROUND YOU, THAT YOU ARE SINGLE AND LOOKING.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> i was on there today and they pinned down my personality and the things i like in men.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_10> FOR YEARS I LOOK AT EVERY STORE AND TRIED LOOKING UP ALL SORTS OF WEB SITES.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> Keep your head up and eyes open.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> but most popular girs have such a messed up life outside of school.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> im still trying to figure that out but i guess you just keep talkin and see where it goes.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> actually most women i know are less patient that me or my friends
<NbChars_40> <LevSim_35> *shaking my head*   No way jose.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> don't let your emotions down, embrace it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> ha thats a really good question.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> they say that to not hurt ur feelings
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> !maybe you dont eel the same way he feels for you ask yourself
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_10> IF YOU HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING BOYFRIEND TELL HIM AND ASK WHAT SHOULD YOU DO.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Most of them make it obvious so if it looks like he likes you, he probably does..
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Tell her to break-up with him!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> usualy, unexperienced girls likes to play although they know exactly what they want.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> If he don't feel the same his loss...
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_25> It isn't like I don't know.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> But THAT is something she's got to do.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> ), be honest with her...gentle maybe, but honest.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> U realy dont know How You Are.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> yes those : just make you look so much older!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Breakups is the hardest but u will eventually get over it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> just another poser masochist begging for attention on the net guys, ignore him
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> think that there are still many guys out there willing to have a realtionship.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> since then he didn't even call me to find out how iam doing.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Easy to get in & out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> that is not love...good luck :)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> rule number one, never date at work.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> yes a little  but not by every gil that walks by  well maybe every girl
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> I met a grrr on the net, shes mean to me and I like it!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> It's not good sex if she doesn't orgasm.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> well see if he looks at u alot and  wants to talk to u alot...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Some people keep going after it's clear that it just won't work anymore.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> a long distance relationship is one of two ppl who live far away, even if u see him, yes.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> it mayb hard b/c u have 2 think...  does he really love u??
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Tell him to kiss and rub AROUND your stuff, but not directly on it after your first Big O.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> If not tell him you are pregnant,  See what he says.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> oneday he came out and ask me did i like him i didn't say anything i just smile.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> that would solve the whole problem.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Remember, there are plenty of fish in the sea =)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> if u like my answer vote it best.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> you are your own online friend .
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> You better back off my man!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> it wasnt untill i found the one that i didnt need to fill any hole's that i got married.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> but theres never a dull moment thats for sure !
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> should i just stay single forever?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Because they choose to b & b-cuz they don't like P****

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> even if he wasn't the one, a guy that considers quitting FOR ME would be incredibly sweet.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> for the other with out expecting  too being pay off later.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> in brief let him hate u and send me back if it succeeded
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> Sorry sweetheart but not all guys cheat.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> ITS TRUE HE LIKES YOU IF HE THINKS YOUR HOT.IF HES NOT A GOOD GUY YOU WILL KNOW.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> It'd not be my first choice of places for him to be hanging out though, thats for sure!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> I guess your still not over here.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> I would not be upset, seen one set seen 'em all, right?

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> just be yourself and after a while hell see that your true to him
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> If a guy likes you, he will let you know!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> sometimes dat can be 4 da  best
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> it doesnt matter how they are packaged....  We are just SEXIER.....*kisses*
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> no its completely normal, im a guy so i should know
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> and the person confronted me on wednesday.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_30> If you are single...keep it that way.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_20> I don't even hate gay people.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> ehh, all I need is a little hole with some heat in there.. ya know what I mean?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> PLAY WITH UR HAIR AND SMILE (BUT NOT FAKE SMILE)!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> yes there is more then 1 right person for everyoe
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> look deep into his eyes he ll understand!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> We want everything, good personality, good brain, good look, everything!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> i'm set for disappointment, i know ;)  so there you have your answer
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> I like that name Chris, so marry him!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> take a guy's shoe size, add two, then divide by two.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> Laugh at the things she teases you about.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> they have to also be your best friend
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> well she told the other person.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> hmmmmmmm.its not really my style, but thats just my opinion.its pretty good though.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> do you think i have chance with a 9th grader i am in the 7th grade
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> How about you meet one and see if you two fall in love, then maybe think about marriage!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> It's like nature power motivating ur romance for specific person, sometimes i called Blind Love
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Hi, it's not what anyone else says.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> OK IF YOU LIKE HIM TRY IT OUT.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> !I would dump him down the drain!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> I have questioned him about cheating (which I know he has!)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Or you could just totally break it off.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> You look for guys that only want you for sex.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> Tell her that your always there for her no matter what.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> i would like think things could change but i don't think i could forget.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> I feel even worse for Jennifer now that they've announced they're pregnant!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> Probably the shock that scraping the bottom of the barrel didn't even work for them!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> From a guys point of view!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> unlike in telling stuff to friends or family members, there's tension if they don't like what they hear.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> If she wasn't good enough for you in the first place why would she come crawling back?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> false because life isn't fair at least that's whats everybody says
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> if you're 13...dont worry about love now...you get to grow up and find someone
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> What I will tell you is this REAL men are fantastic and are nothing like that.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> all i can say is relax and enjoy your wife,,, and let her enjoy you
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> I feel so depressed and I can't get my mind off of him.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> i'm doing it but i'm looking for someone who doesn't...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> so then from that there like she'll do anything i want, since she likes me so much.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> or u can tell of the friends of the guy or girl
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> His face will not glow ing thw dark.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> At least I'd like ot think so!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> well if he bein bad to you DONT!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> he has feelings too, don't play with him.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> Either tell him you want him or u don't.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> so maybe you should just figure out what makes you happy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> i would say pursue it and see where it goes.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> Well if he allways stares at you alot there's a start.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> You can get her in dream...!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> I don't know if he likes me or if he jus wants sex ..
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> well if he's way older forget it.... but jus be out w/ it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> 1. wear sexy outfit(its better to wear nothing at all!!)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> And don't decide what average is by looking at porn...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Hey look at all the Greek statues!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Did he say yes or no.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> hold her neck with soft hands and kiss her on the back of her ear
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> They want make out with you maybe even S**  and then leave you there for another girl!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> (tho not all)  Bugs me to the core.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> It all depends on how much you like this guy and how much you know him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Make sure somebody filmes it because it's gonna be hell of funny to watch on tape.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> Girls get a lot of attention they don't want.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> The issues that come along might be bigger then your booty ;-)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> She either feel in love with her ex again or you were an extreme jerk.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Just wait until she is in love with you maybe until you are married to have sex!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> well just have someone else  buy them for you
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> an honest answer to that is, no.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> get him to get a condom?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> if you just let if all flow.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_20> Do you see what I'm saying at all?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> i'm single but i have a guy friend that i can kiss.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> your heart is going to break one way or the other.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> ya the only way he is going to know is tell him.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_20> No dumb chicks either, stupid girls are passe.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> why would you ever do that?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> that you're not getting from your boyfriend.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> Not completely drunk but a lil tipsy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> I have no idea what the hell you just said!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> you cant give up you gotta try different things but most likely be yourself!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> you'll know it when you find it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Oh but that's a good one.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> leave it alone there is nothing worst then two female fighting over some guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> do the things you always wanted to but couldnt because you were married
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> A man who likes to dress in womens clothing
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> yes he really does sounds like  good one you have there
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> that the romance is chemical... or biological... its natural...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> yes we notice when a guy check us out!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_15> Well you could start it by saying WHAT DO YOU THINK OF OUR RELATIONSHIP SO FAR?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> i even tried calling him and he doesn't answer my calls.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> because if you have a positive attitude then that light in you shows
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> you could have whip cream or something that she/he likes
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> Yes and I love her and my children
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Ask your doc if it's a problem..
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> Alot of girls want someone that they can just hang out with and who will be there with.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> So, if a girl over looks you for your social status than she is not worth it... Really...
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> Some men want a good girl, while others try to stay away from women with morals!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> sure its ok to have oral sex....and i'm sure he'll enjoy it!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> so, yes do help her she'll love you more for it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> you get him to know you then you really ahve a chance.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> he wants a threesome with another dude.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> My problem is...after the break up.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> his other friends showed up later that night.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Have fun making one anyways-  Good Luck!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> when she gives you head after you DEMAND it
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> I would give him a good talking to!
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> watch a dirty movie and get raunchy.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> The guy needs to pull back, really.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> why would any married man want to go see any other woman naked besides his wife?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Grl, just do what you got to do!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> Because, I feel something pulling me over here.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> YOU WILL HAVE HER SHAKING BELOW!!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> the sooner its over the sooner everyone can learn to live with it and move on!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> for some its just a matter of will power to get out and let things happen!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> Bump'n'grind, knocking da boots, bubble pop electric
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Guys just don't know how lucky they are.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> I used to play this shit with a girl I knew from a couple years back.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> If he wants to spend time with you he probably likes you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> yeah , but not wgen some one is pushed aside
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> TO ANY WOMAN NO MATTER HOW BEAUTIFULL SHE MAY BE.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> you should ask her straight up.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON ALOT OF THINGS, THE OLDER THE MORE COMPLICATIONS.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Is is ok for your hubby to watch sports without nagging?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Do you love him and does he love you back?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> but dont forget the highly sensitive area between a nus and the balls.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> be yourself, unless yourself is a loser.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> If you can't spell it, you shouldn't be tasting it...
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> yes it's ok to still love your ex.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_25> i dont know who that is
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> have one long flirting conversation while doing something he likes.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> Definately the kid, no question, at all!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> pic-nic at the park, free festivals (look in your city's website -there is always free stuff going on.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_35> Does he avoid something he dislikes or isn't good at?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_20> You don't wanna just kiss anybody.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> and where is she right now in here life.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> if he loves you he will wait for you.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> Did you have sex with him?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> And I've had a crush on him since 6th grade .. and now we in tha 10 ...
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_20> First of all, cut her off.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> Now it varies, but I never go back to really fit.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> If you know him real well then go for it, girl!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> I think he has bigger issues (excuse the pun) then your booty.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> MOST WOMEN WON'T MAKE THE FIRST MOVE, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN SHE DOESN'T WANT YOU TO.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> and if u end up never falling n love with him break up.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> ive been the cheater and the person cheated on .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Love is blind but it sure seems to find its way around!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> i think it is a bigger deal for us than for guys anyway!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> it's really normal to think of him and love him because u just do.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> I need some help .. don't get me wrong thou .. he look GOOD !!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> You are her freind, you need to tell her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> My sis is getting married to someone she met online
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> tell him u love him with all ur heart
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> but if you really love him it will work itself out =)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> SO GOOD LUCK IN THE REAL WORLD!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> So to easy his mind I brought this and it works...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> be very careful because you dont know who youre talking to most of the time.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> personal loans could be a good idea.... otherwise...well..borrow!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> AND tell her how beautiful she is.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> In my opinion... lucky girl you've found your Mr.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> donot do it honey you kill your sprit by ding that .just try to forget him .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> you are home-wreaker and you should be nervous.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> because you've been looking at porn.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> LOVE CAN MAKE U OR BREAK U.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> And don't change, because a guy might not like you!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Do I tell my Ex about this?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i already went out with him but i really want to get back together.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> This is kinda a given babe.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> OMG that man is just WAY to sexy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> you love the person because of who he is and not who you want him to be.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> If not you guys could always be friends
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> Then give him a nice compliment.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> but you may have to get over it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> in english do u having Sex with your friends?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> If you mean close female friends that your wife knows because you introduced her (right?)
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> we still aren't friends like before but we speak to ea other.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> LOL (i know you asked about how to learn to kiss)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> One of my friends is even gay.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> I am still looking for the One, but he would be a man that likes me as I am.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Then I tapped the girl infront of me and asked her Hey, do you have a pencil by chance?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> If he asks you what's wrong?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> So i accussed her of doing that.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Get it out there b 4 u lose a friend
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> i didnt know how to react so i didnt say anything.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> If he isn't ready for a relationship w/ u I think you should give him some room.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> you should go out with this guy just once, and see if you really don't like him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> If you notice hes flirting past normal for him then you guys should talk.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Show her that you are a good man, and will make a good husband and father!!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Hope you enjoy :) lol jk
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> i think u should move on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> I want to join, but want to see what you guys think first.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> And Im sure he didnt propose to your booty, right?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> Hoobastank -- song To Be With You.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> this is america we speak english!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> cause it depends if they allow some young teenagers to buy condoms.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> no, you need more than just sex,  sex is too overrated!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> All guys want a girl that makes their friends jealous.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> try to judge the guy's intentions.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> I myself am a big girl.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> She told you it is okay to kiss her
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Be loving,careing...and most IMPORTANTLY: BE YOURSELF( NATURAL )
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> best love is that which helps and makes u against worst
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> you don't want some girl with your man.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> because the stranger does not know u well and can not judge u because of that.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_45> just go up and ask him out
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_35> A hickey is put there to show up!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> I know that it is not easy  but if you dont start now, when?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> I don't understand girlz..why they cheat with true lover...?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> They always do, but sometimes pretend they don't.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> i mean just bcuz we break up dont mean we have 2 stop bieng cool.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> DONT FORGET TO CHOOSE AND VOTE FOR BEST ANSWER!!!
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_25> all is fair in love and war.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> She want's u to earn it.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> May i suggest TWISTER  It works great!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> WHY IS IT THAT THESE WOMEN HAVE SUCH AN EFFECT ON ME AS WELL AS MOST MEN
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> to have love for your ex
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> If I didn't like them I wouldn't be with them.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> i LOVE nice guys, they have a sensitive side.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Just pick the public that likes it, don't invite the ones that don't.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> blondes are freaks everybody knows that
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> well...it depends...does the one u like really likes u in return?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> Well you can't really do that unless he wants to love you.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> some women like the shy type.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> if u tell him u dont love him it will hurt his feelings very bad.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> cuz she wants to go to the dance with you or maybe cuz she likes you.
<NbChars_280> <LevSim_25> ask if he is and if he says no get an attitude.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> without loving yourself there is no way that you can truely love anyone or anything.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> As far as the other thing, i dont know the guy.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Go see it when you get a chance.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> either way, trust me on this one, u will know when u are ready.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> OH YEAH JUST LIKE THE CAT WOMAN TAMING HER BEAST

<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> and we're in the same boat!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> if your 18, try someone younger.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> a simple explination is its just the way they are
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> Oh.. and they want everything THEIR way.

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> But more of my male friends say it's latex that does for them.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> does look matter THAT much to u?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> my mom was 35 when she had me, if you don't feel like it don't do it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> For the sake of embarrassment, DON'T ASK HIM!!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> because you cant sleep with her without her permission other wise it's rape.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> Like others say education comes first!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> either he met friends he is just chatting with or he is up to no good.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> WE just always think it is.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> Not to mention it could add hype to your sex life!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Okay, especially after you get married.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> and let me guess, your the right guy???
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> He's single and you're single so why not?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> if not, try getting to know him a little better, ask him about his love life...just hang out.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> Enjoy :)   Source(s):  many many years of watching porn and playing with toys with my husband (happily!)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> if u need help than talk me lat.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> tell her you want to be her everything.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> it really depends...just think when they are going into college...how old do you want to be when that happens?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> im proof that opposites attract !
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> Oh some of them are really cool.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Hmm, no hard feelings after 3 years?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> I choose to spend my time hangin' with the guys.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> I have cheated on my husband.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> do it in the butt :)
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> and that he is the one that you whan to be with.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> but i think it is as long as nobody gets hurt
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Wait a minute men do it too!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> omg omg  u r beautiful i love you WILL YOU MARRY ME?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> not trying to hook up with this girl.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Poop has never flew outta their asses I guess.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> keep wishin because it is going to ruin your relationship.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> I know what im talking about.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> DON'T ASK A WOMAN FOR SEX!!!!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> it is hard for many guys...like guys that can't grow up, if that is the case find someone new.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> there are some things that people will always see in a diffrent way, like politics, religion ect.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> If you already went out with him and there's no chemistry, then you're wasting his time and yours.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Institute -- Entire First Album Bush -- All Bush albums!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Don't go spreading your dirty germs everywhere, you are not solving the problem, just enhancing it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> well juss get in a chat room or talk to me    love_my_saddle@yahoo.com
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> JUST TELL HER HOW U FELL ABOUT HER
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> I believe in fallin in luv quick but with someone that u know.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_40> she will want a lot of sex...
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> so we should try to have the virginity in our mind .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> i love kids to death im even willing to date someone who has kids it doesnt boter me.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Then respond with oh, I'm just real busy right now and quickly walk away.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Other times if it's not that serious, just agree with her.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> try 1 on a weekend then the other then you can decide
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> do you have any aniverseries or birthdays coming up?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> Maybe the boys are intimidated by your brains.....guys are like that.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> U HAVE BEEN TOGETHER FOR TO LONG.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> Obviously he is cheating on you!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> U shud have sex only with the person whom u marry.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> ask her out and confess your love to her
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Then when no ones looking he'll ask u out.
<NbChars_40> <LevSim_35> no, because that is too cleshea'(or however you spell that).
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> I guess you are young  and can deal with this .
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> I think its because they generally don't like you.. but hey he was an idiot move on!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> it has many reasons that reasons cannot reason Ü
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> Just think I can do this, I got this
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> i have felt telepathy many times.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Women are easier to deal with then most men realize.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> After all, boys come & go.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> HOW ABOUT YOU DO THINGS THAT U KNOW I DONT WANT YOU TO DO.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> some say that they way a guy treats his mom is the way he will treat his woman.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> have tats love wines all music and good fun.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> if your now-man is flirting w/ someone, id believe the ex.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> how can they trust again, or even block the what if thoughts out.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> dont let yourself worry about it or things may not go well.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> Just be yourself  Don't rush or you'll crush
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> Until he works that out stay far away from him!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> !..plus it would help US to kno ur age
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> do unto others what u want others do unto u. do u want cheating?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Kick his a-- all the way to divorce court.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> i think that you type too much.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> tell her how you feel about her and never give up
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> Good luck and keep the romance going!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> But if sleeping with one guy makes me a whore or something, then whatever.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> no sweetie the chaeting guys are immature a real man knows what he wants and will not cheat.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> Hi , its not soo a hard nut to crack ur baffling problem dudete...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> You have to let her know that you love her and you wouldnt do that to her ok!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> Dude, if you are going to date a girl that asks loaded questions, you gotta know how to deal.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Ask to your so-called best friend,Do u really care about me?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Go to a strip club and/or get a hooker.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> if that guy is me i love you
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> i personally think guys dont like girls to be as smart or smarter than them.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> Even if you knew a guy from birth, you were still strangers at SOME point!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> If she smiles, you gotta winner.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> or, u kan talk 2 her friends first.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> or Did u like the movie.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_35> When you tell her sorry, also send her flowers with your love...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> what are you pickle or banana we should definitely chat
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> A dream girl is someone who is sexy enough to look acceptable to anyone !
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Physical,, I perfer skinny women with smaller chests!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i mean im a girl but thats wat makes a girl feel better unless shes stuck up
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> as long as you both are willing to work at it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> be confident and act like you have done this a million times before
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> it sucks but it wont change.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_55> If she's not, then just ask her to leave you guys alone.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> i believe so.good luck on that girl!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Both - I leave it to the lady to decide.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Ok... see he has a girl friend and he says that he is straight.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> I do not have  boyfreind and nethier do a lot of my freinds.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> In short, my answer is ...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> if UR still alone by V-day... hang out with friends!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> i'm shy around him, but he flirts with me a lot.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> yes   but in a special church
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> how are u meant for someone u dont like?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> mmmmmmmmmmm (i'm getting moist just thinking about it!!!!)
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> realize that you dont need a man to be happy.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> ur in luck cuz i jus happen 2 b a GURL!!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> If you get the rigth question, let me know!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> school or have a  friend hook u up with someone or something!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> A nice card would be good
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> naw but he have 1 for me
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> um... don't take the pic if she doesn't want you to.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> which is what you should do!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Maybe it's just you they don't want to have sex with.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> For example, if you are facing a firing squad ........... Fire!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> Help me get it right for once!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Then ask her :)     Best wishes!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> maybe your ex is jealous but if you two are on good terms he might not be lying.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Well ask him or just keep wondering
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_50> see the red flags for what they are.....caution..do not eneter...DANGER!
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_30> How do you know a guy is a player?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> Go to superpages.com they have a free reverse look up!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> because its so sexys to see gurls make out and its just good very good
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> But I love gentlemen so I would ask hey can I sit here?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Don't ge me wrong, I love my wife to deat and would do absoluely anything for her.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> would u put it out for all to see or keep it personal!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> its rather to be friends with him then to lose him at all.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> why not ask mary or marques?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> he had a 4 month affair w/her and slept w/her then would come home to me.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_10> KEEP IN MIND NO ONE KNOWS THAT I AM GAY.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> (Just don't judge the good ones, by the bad ones stupidity!)
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_10> CHECK YOUR SPELLING, AND MAYBE I WILL BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION BETTER
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> While she was reading the gift certificate and talking about how wonderful it was, BAM!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> you might've even caused your break up with your ex by telling his friend t.m.i.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> being random is what makes life fun
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> if you are not looking good he will not be attracted to you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> Try it again it's gonna get better.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> just be honest with her girls like honesty.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> the same reason girls like boys :)
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> Do what I did one time.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> I've met girls with the same problems though!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> When I tell people that they look at me like yea right, like exes can not be friends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> But ask yourself the big question...do you really want it to be different or just more involved & thoughtful?
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_30> Dress up and get a hair cut.
<NbChars_260> <LevSim_25> Just be like, hey - I like you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> I know I have been there and a lot of my friends--guys and girls!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> u get over him or try to make him jealos
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> Smile, and say hi.... and just start talking...... generally
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> You just have to wait for the girl who gets all excited.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> MY FIRST TIME IT WAS LIKE,FINALLY I'M THERE MMM FEELS BETTER THAN I THOUGHT,OH MY,IT FEELS SO GOOD.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> I HAVE GONE THROUGH THIS MANY TIMES IT VERY HHARDDD.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> i would you doubt that there is any hope for you?
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> Not all men are like that.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> i find it cute and so grown man.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> My honey is going to be low on moola so if I get some flowers then I'll be happy.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> it means he doesn't care about you but he wants to have sexual relations with you.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> just say it and then give her a sweet LITTLE kiss!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> r u playin with urself..or ruinin ur life... u r goin to let other person use you .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> as a fello girl, i say go for it and BREAK THAT SiCK MAN'SZ HEART!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> my friends would all come over and say how cute they were.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> The two men, will probably fight.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> Send her sexy and romantic txt msgs.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> there are plenty of aids predetors waiting to share there  missouri with people like u and i.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> i aint listenin to a guy trying to pick me up!
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_40> E. that you are now sick?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> .. and be upfront with it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> And that's alot harder on the guy.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> either masterbates, or watch people have sex,
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> and inside were all the same
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> cleaned house...then he could take me out for lunch..lol
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> im going to have to say no on this one.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> 3. invite he out on the weekend.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> No way, if he does it once, he'll do it again.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> : ur mother or father start acting differently.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> it caused me such pain and sorrow for i was that uptown boy long ago...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> You walk really slow when your with them.....  10.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> So all i can say is follow your heart!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> and he used it against the both of you to get what he wants!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> HELL I TOLD YOU TO GO TO SCHOOL AND DO WHAT YOUWANT TO DO.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> Ever guy is different and has diffent wants and needs.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Not me, but maybe one of my girls.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Tell her, but don't expect it to do much good at first.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> EITHER JUST MAKE SURE YOUR GROOMED WELL
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> don't worry u will find mr right.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> walk behind the 1st couple or sit in the back seat with ur date.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> and if you could make someone love you, it would be artificial, and who would want that?
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_20> It was all blonde slutty looking girls who's hobbies are like  drinking with hot guys, partying  blah blah.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> maybe the boyfriend dont have a problem maybe its a issue at work or family that has him upset.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> i dont think shes/hes a worth while friend if you friendship is when its conveint.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> so they they can get girls they think just becuase there string we'll sleep with them
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> no, because they r gay and cant have a baby of their own?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> seems like more guys want to get married and start a family before the girls do now a days.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> a trained counselor or a pedophile using the internet?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> Depends on if you had sex with another 11 year old....or like your 40 yr. old dad.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> sometimes you will not find him, he will find you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Ok, it sounds like your real young.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Men think; nothing goes in them to 'defile' them that I shower can not wash off.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> i used to hate girls with big boobs until i finally hit puberty and got them.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> They say divorce is like death.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_25> If you don't want to, then don't.
<NbChars_385> <LevSim_20> I think you should move on
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> Its sexy to see 2 beautiful women, but even two beautiful men is kinda gross.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> Get to know other guys, and look for someone that wants to be with YOU!
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_25> I was 15, I'm now 23, and don't regret a moment of it!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> What the hell does that mean?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Does anyone else think he cheated again?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> its a two way street so you should not be handling the relationship by yourself.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> Take your time, have fun, and laugh !
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> both but to be loved is totally better
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> I hope this helps you out alittle!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> YES UNFORTUANATELY:( AND I'M STILL GETTING OVA IT.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> where are you looking for women ?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> nope their all out to lunch
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> But you might get in A NASTY SITUATION IF YOU DON'T MAKE THIS CLEAR.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> I don't have one either...kind of like it better that way...most the time anyway.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> Why do guys care bout how strong they are or if they have a six pack or not?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> try to put yourself in there place.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> It's just ALSO true that we like more of a good thing.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> IF he's thinking anything, it's YEAH, she's letting me near her breasts!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Be confident that you are a complete person now, they don't like desparate guys.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> try to ask question funny question that will do it.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> For All- Does it really matter if a female shaves her vulva (PUBIC HAIR)?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> but who's a virgin now a days
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> It sounds like it to me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> I don't steal or cheat on anything.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> PLUS, YOU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL W/ MEN WHO ARE WILLING TO MESS W/ YOU EVEN IF YOU'RE MARRIED.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> you won't give anybody a time of day.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> If your passed the age of 20, kinda worry about it.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> the first kiss the guy sould make the move ,, its just how its post to be
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Ask her whats up with that?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> have sex and in between talk about important issues that you feel strong about...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> SEX IS NATURE, JUST AS RAIN IS NATURE IT POURS DOWN AND WET THE GROUND.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> U can get it up but u need to get more excited about it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> hard to understand with all the ****s but i'm guessing.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> wut are sms jokes?i could probably care less
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Sit on a couch, have popcorn, and watch THE MOVIE
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> they laff at you behond you back.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> you can probably do it yourself.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_10> KEEP LOOKING...THE HOT AND LOVING COMES AFTER THE RING.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> haah no.. they want you to do the leg work.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> ANY woman who feels sexy, will WANT to take a nude picture for the man she loves.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> battery and a firework got arrested, 1 got charged the other got let off
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> bUT IF YOUR BOYFRIEND TREATED YOU LIKE CRAP WELL HE DESERVES IT....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Where did you here this rumor?
<NbChars_290> <LevSim_25> maybe you should be a shoe salesman like Al Bundy
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> smoke a cig,pretend your finished lol
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> that is what my book says
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> Because u r a young stallion.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Just b yourself and start talking.. you will know if its a good thing to by her response
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> it's human nature for boys to like girls babe...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> take ur time and the time is right tell him
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> Sometimes marriage counseling is alot cheaper!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> because it's just awesome and hot, but if two guys did it, it is just weird and nasty.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> and short skirts... depends how short.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> have you ever seen him with a girl, or talk about other women?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> So if your not a bouncer don't worry i would probably be more attracted to you.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> If she shows concern then.............. be warned
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> you have to be able to look the other person in the eye at least...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Well, what do men really want?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> i like this boy but i don't know if he likes me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Go get you another women and get on with your LIFE!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Keep 'em guessing....  You're a man, aren't you?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Trust me, you don't want to deal with that crap.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> yes u can, bcoz u dont have any more relationshpis
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> DON'T FOOL YOURSELF INTO BELIEVING THIS GUY WILL PLEASE YOU IN WAY YOUR HUSBAND CAN'T OR WON'T.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> Depends how much money you have
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> other than that, i don't think anyone would appreciate sharing a bed with someone like that.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> A guy feels pleasure...No pain...I know it sucks but its the truth.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> And usually just after you stop looking.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_30> use protection every, single time- even clinton style
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> Just say hello nice ti ts and then say did I say that out loud.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> maybe you really are just a nice guy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> hmmm, if head counts then i got head on the monster plantation(boat ride in the dark) at sixflags(over georgia).

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> they are hard to deal with but don't let them stop you.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_35> You get slapped, or B. you get laid.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> well, try to enjoy what she enjoys!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> i would want a guy to be honest, tell her you will still b friends.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> would you rather them like boys?!?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_20> 7 to 8 inches, give or take a little, ...lol
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> just go up and ask what can it hurt?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> they'll call you stupid &you'll ruin your reputation.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> yeah i think guys do care about how you look!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> YES, after awhile it starts to lose meaning.Been There and Still There!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_10> HEY, GO NOW AND LOOK IN THE MIRROR!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> ( Although having the baby before sex wasn't really possible)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> it could be school related or something u found out she liked.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> it doesnt matter so much about the size.its all in the way you work it!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> Don't knock it until you try it.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> gals like other gals similar to guys like gals.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> I think I he liks me for me but that never hapons
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> Dont ruin a good thing if you have got it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> no is she the owner of parker pens
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> Im sorry but your **** out of luck ... because she is to old!!!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> First look at your nick, decadence angel!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> with my hubby for days i wont want him to touch me.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> play her game w/ her and if she freaks tell her thats what she does to you.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> well, id say.. brought me shopping.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> AND I JUST MARRIED HIM LAST YEAR.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> or you will find yourself getting somthing that you don't want.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> always put this at the back of your mind: fidelity is for women while infidelity is for men
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> Nope, you are totally screwed...unless you are a Mormon.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> 2)What should i do to impress her / him?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> And she's the only girl I've ever kissed.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> They're just stupid underwear that go up your butt as far as I can see.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> try to break the illusion.think of him as just some ordinary guy.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> Is it all a test to see how far they can take it or how much u can handle.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> Being a good girl is a good thing without a doubt.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> whoever that guy is he's a jerk and also very screwed up in the head.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> everybody wants to give precious gift to his love.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> get it together dude,start thinking with your cock!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> get out now, hold your head high, and wait for a guy who'll drop everything for you!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> HEY YOU SHOULD JUST TALK 2 HIM!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> when they start tryin to tease you about it
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> She obviously likes the other girl, so back up and let her be.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_10> YOU HAVE BEEN SHACKED-UP FOR 3 YEARS AND NOW WANT A RESPECTABLE RELATIONSHIP.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> Women bleed for four days and don't die.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> then you will just get hurt again.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> YOUR HIGHT SIZE DON'T MATTER AS LONG AS IT DON'T BOTHER YOU.KEEP 13,14 OUT OF IT,TO YOUNG.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> If that fails spend all your money on her - but I wouldn't do that!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> ask her to join you for a coffee
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> IF TWO PEOPLE ARE ON THE SAME PAGE IT CAN WORK OUT REALLY NICE.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> not a creator of problems... but every now and then... GIVE IT UP!!!..
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> well u should pick a girl that will love u very much.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> Turned off...talking Erect...touching  It's not rocket science...excuse the pun...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Pay the fee (not worth it) and you'll be able to IM all you want.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_50> Ask her out for valentines day.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> Agreed, if you like things the way they are, but want more, just don't push anything.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> Well, I think yes and no.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> Maybe you should talk about it with your brother FIRST, then see what happen's with this boy you like.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_20> you should sit together on a couch so that she'll fell all sunglely then she'll like you
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> my boyfriend wants the same from me and i dont want to.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> Go out and make it happen!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_15> are you guys IN-LOVE WITH EACH OTHER???
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> well uh yea im normally a really nice guy but ur a fucked up ho
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> I think you have a lot of money and the sisters know it!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> now i know how to dress
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> If you want bad advice, this is probably a good place :)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Even though I am single there are only certain types of guys that I feel attracted to.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> you dont want to be stereotyped with all females,niether do guys.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Well if your already boyfriend and girlfriend, it shouldnt be a problem asking her to do anything
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> for example say he says I LOVE YOU like 5 times back to back
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> That, and they know men are pigs.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> ask him.....and a friend who would know.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> Try to move on and just stay FRIENDS with her for now.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Girls love candles, thats what I give all my girls!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Yep... kinda makes you wonder why you broke up with him??
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> and dont be creepy about it!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> With guys, it is more like a Check this one out and then it is over.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> (only people without money will tell you different because they don't have it)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> BABY DON'T HURT ME, DON'T HURT ME, NO MORE!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> find out who her favorite band is and buy her a tshirt , cd or video of them.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> talk to her ask her hows her love life goin.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> first of all convince a girl
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Simply because you are a GOOD person.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Best friends do not do this to a friend!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> It's not as sweet if you make it a big huge deal.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> But hey nothing Ben N' Jerry's and some chickflicks couldn't help, or rebound dating.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Maybe you should hang out with some guys sometimes.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Makeup works or just blame it on a curling iron, haha
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> So don't worry what are u sad for?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> you dont have to be a vergo, just real.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> yes and i love the time i do that with feeling love with lady betwen 50 60
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> he has the right to know.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> rumors always have an element of truth!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> yeah i am but it wont work.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> Sure, if you don't mind the pain of having your cojones cut off.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> But what if it doesn't just happen?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> i think lee ryan  i just looove that accent
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> in your situation its so hard.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> She will look at u all the time.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> congrats on the pursuit of being a pastor.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> Don't let anyone on here lie to you!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> it depends on the age of the guy.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> first... take off all suggestive pictures in your profile - you attract the morons like me.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Why all the people have problems with speech...and spelling need to ask such dumb question?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> they open their mouths and TALK!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> not much maybe your love to your girl and flowers and chocolate.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> of cos sexy gals can aroused gals like the guys.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> chat rooms, or use your search engine.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> OK let me break this down, I am a woman.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> But if he just keeps talking then put this one in the history book and keep moving.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> does he go on the computer?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> YES..  Love can happen anywhere..anytime..you never know it!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> like fofull ur greatest sex fantasy.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> But if shes hot, then GET R DUN or something like that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> i AM THIRTEEN AND  WHAT I DO IS JUST TALK TO HIM AND TRY TO BE BEST FRIENDS.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> u that is unless you dont know him well enough.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> ask yourself, what type of girl are you looking for and what would she be doing.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> I don't mean playing hard to get.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> if she doesnt like u the way u r then dont form to what she wants.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> Always watch their actions and don't go just by the I love you alone...K
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_20> NOW YOU MUST TRY TO WORK IT OUT!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> even if they r gay, they also have a love live.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Just be yourself and it will happen!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> unless u are a lucky one an find a nice guys but theres only about 2 of them.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> and multiple partners as in i'm gonna sleep with you today and your brother tomorrow?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Whispering in my ear and tickleing
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> plus i dnt want a chik whos a village bicycle so i hold my self by the same standards.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> I wouldn't be gay to start with.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> Now - you can throw yourself into work/life.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_5> IT NEVER SHOULD BE; BE AWARE
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Stay a virgin or don't do it again, until you are married.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Love is when you cannot stop thinking about that person and you always want to see him/her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> He does kinda flirt with me but then laughs...
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> uhm....they are nicer to look at >.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> if u got friends who can connect u to new people, then u have chances to meet someone nice.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_30> Cheaters are sexier when your drunk!)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> just tell her to knock it off
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> funny it is, but guess the way it's said... PINKU
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> To me hook up is like foreplay but no sex.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> You've got the girl, you don't need the porn.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> my friend slept with a guy one night... no sex.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> he is a bit shy and i want to make him love me more.how could i do this?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> I wasn't looking, wasn't expecting anything...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> thinking about other women is not cheating.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> I hope everything works out for you guys, just talk about it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Don't worry, everyone likes to talk about themselves!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> But that's what it feels like everytime I'm with him.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Are you a now a woman, or just a pathetic stalker.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> Im not, why be affraid to tell people.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> how about no pick up line.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> If u aint given, he thinks that u dont love him and appreciate him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> That I have to teach her how.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> wipe the tears with your bear hand and kiss on the cheek
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> NOT You SHOULDNT HAVE SEX TILL MARRIAge DONT YOU KNOW HOW TO READ
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Hope you find peace soon...so much anger cannot be fun.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Try to move on,what else can u do.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> Just enjoy it & do what feels right.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> but to a certain extent they look good on alot of girls.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> and why didn't you ever leave?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> why don't go to i am a fucker.com bitch
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Then his friend couldn't go with me then.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> no dont that is a huge age diffence for younger people
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> everything.except things i don't know anything about
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> how did you know you were gay?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> they tell you they love you, yet they still leave...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> if ur shy to sk someone out then no good.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> some guys dont appreciate that though.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> soeone who can better understand her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> How did you ask your girlfriend to go out with you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> If I were you, I'd be wondering what else he lies about.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> well just go out and hopefully youll find one !!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> do you think he would take you back if you cheated.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> i like this guy a lot at my school.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> You just like black women and don't know it.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_10> FIND OUT FOR SURE..IF ITS TRUE THEN DUMP HIS SORRY BUTT
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> So, can a guy really be too nice of a person?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> don't let anyone tell you different.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> It is not right in Gods eyes!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> i know it sounds like a cliché but it may be the best thing u can do.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Could be a number of reasons: 1) Confidence level -- she could be shy!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> then if you are with someone then thats another thing also.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Genie - as in the bottle kind.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> talk to him and see if he thinks it has fallen apart too.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> i think she likes u but doesn't want to tell keep trying to get to her!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> Sometimes it's hard for us girls to accept that guys just aren't exactly like us.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Be loved cuz then you feel special inside =)
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> so ask ur date to take a walk and excuse ur else from the other couple.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> you're getting married, and your fiance suspect's you're interested in your ex?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> just love thats what a woman longs for
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> no, but any one that would have sex with you at such a young age would think your one.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> YES ITS A FREE COUNTRY WHY NOT
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> think about not what you say to him, but how you say it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> So why do you like me?lol.............
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> I see alot of celebs doing it but not only celebs are getting in the trend!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> LOVE HIM... for real... don't fake love.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Hey hon, can you just grab me another beer?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> But if he tries to act nice and talk nice to you, then... you know.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> out of the blue 9 out of 10 times is because he is looking for a booty call.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> That's cheating, I feel bad for the boyfriend.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> i know what you are talking about.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> correct me if I'm wrong but isn't everyone different?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> 1)how do u know if u love a person?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> she has a great body, great abs, pretty face and nice perky boobs.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> Sexually - get to know the man in the boat.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> unable to enjoy life as someone is overbearing.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> (Unless he is a horse... size usualy doesn't matter.)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Get some and you'll not think about it as much.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Keep that guy who love's you a lot in your pocket and maybe you will love him later.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> Thats all it takes, a friendly hello and--Boom!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> my mom says it's wrong but she don't know how comfortable i am around him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> You can't have too many friends.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> What was the deal w/ the first marraige??
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> there are some that do(just cannot rememberthe name).
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> No it's one of the most sacred rules ever you don't date your X'S friend... it's called BACKSTABBING!!!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> IF YOUR MARRIED IS GOOD, STICK W/ YOUR HUSBAND.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> I'm 17, I can sing, I'm a sweet guy, not bad looking, and I'm going to be a pastor.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i just want someone to spend it with and that would work just fine for me
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> What if this guy scams people for a living?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> let you eyes ponder and it will direct you to that perfect girls of you fantasy or dreams ...
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> Rate your marriage on a scale of 1-10...10 being best  What makes it so good/bad?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> What do women really want ?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> They care because they want girls and friends to think that they are hot and sexy!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> Really dear... don't ask ppl on such question... but if u're askin for advice.. then here's mine...
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> Also how would you ask her out?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Especially if you broke up for some reason.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> whenever i look at any particular thing first thing that comes in my mind is sex.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> someone will like you as you are
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> This way, if she doesn't have a boyfriend, she'll probably ask YOU to go to dinner with HER!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> At that point you would probably become the cheater...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> I went and picked her up (yeah, her mom wouldn't let her get her license, even at age 18!)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> i'll give you fifty bucks to sit by me for two hours
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> it is hard to tell from your question......
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> Depends on the guy,as an emo i can say i would be just happy being with that girl.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_35> never ever ever believe this, its a lame excuse and its only used so they dont feel guilty!!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> when you see her around and you dont know where you where going or do
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_50> I'm in love with my soulmate, confidante and best friend...and the great thing is, she loves me, too!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> like making love..what you want and expect.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> depends, not on the first night though.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> plis I love to read youre advice........
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Think about it - it is kinda great to be bachelor again!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> i have a couple straight friends like that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Do that BEFORE moving on with the other guy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> i don't have much luck myself.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> just be a friend and show her what you are like on the inside.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Well to me it seems like these so called good friends aren't such good friends at all.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> We live together now and he is an amazing guy!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> they might just think ur trying to do them a favor and dating em to make them feel good.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> Sunshine's on the right track....so pick her as best if it comes down to she or I.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> if you two are with other pepole or what
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> im a girl send me a pic my email is ltenenbaum9119@yahoo.com or wildone91191991@hotmail.com
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> like he liked that part of you?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> or just keep track of how boys react around you... and so some investigation..
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> I just don't get it, that adult's these days have no self control.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> and that's not a bad thing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> you might like them a lot, but it isn't love.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> If she does'nt like u then foget her and go find a girl that can like u for u.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_40> Don't worry, he's with YOU now.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> maybe start with sexy fully clothed pictures.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> Anyway it always cracks me up to think of a car rocking back and forth so for me no.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> Okay... Before you get any FURTHER attached, let her go!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> tell him that u have a boyfriend and tell him that u can be friends with him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> PRAY to the most high GOD to put her in your path!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> Does it really sound like he has changed??
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_10> YOU KNOW I WNATED TO HUG AND KISS ALL THE TIME YOU NEVER WANTED TO.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> HIS GAME IS OVER, AND YOU'RE LEFT OUT TO DRY BY YOURSELF.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Best advice, don't do the crime and you won't have to face the time.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Typically you'd say thanks, because apparently he thinks it's *time* you got some new draws.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> of course, if they really are 'true' enough.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> i don't think he will say now (can i join in)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> some day you will, and you will knew why?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> and the other girl... i'll let someone else answer that
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> i promise it works bcoz i had chkd svrl times on many girls in such cases.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Let her know you are a virgin if she doesn't already.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> babe, sadly i think your man is cheating.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> love is a buttiful thing but i u play with ur LOVE = emotions then u just ****ed up
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> wut i did wuz be nice but dont go out of the way to do things wth her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Once a while,she would be nice to me and i feel like in heaven!.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> who gives a fuck with sms jokes,be real girl
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_20> MINE DID AND WE HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR 35 YEARS.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_25> if he can't take it then lose him.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> do it in person, it hurts worse when its done over the phone
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_50> Why is she jealous... coz she loves u.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> !And for Godssakes please don't have a baby that young,a baby will complicate your life even further!!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> Find out who you 'real' friends are?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> i think the best way is to stay friends with that guy.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> Not all women are like that .
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_20> Thay way you're in the 'driver's seat ;)
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_60> if you keep changing you mind on him .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> hell yeah, go out and look.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> Only is she is not really a girl.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> but i dont wear them in college??
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> and the thing is his family doesnt like for both of you to be together.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> He wants to send u mixed signals and amplifies the attraction process more....!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> read the book He's  just not that into you!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> IM NOT SAYING YTHAT U R LIEING I AM JUST NOT SUR.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> if they really are just making it up then you wouldnt have been good together anyways
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> r u jeolous if so get over it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> ask her if she likes the movie Beauty and the Beast.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Well from my saying, you should go on and flirt with him alotto try and get to know him!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> after we had this talk he then ask me are we o.k.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> Youngest age: 16 No younger that that!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> what you should do is flirt with him a bit and smile around him.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> ONCE IN A WEEK IFU CAN AFFORD IT BUDDY
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> well you must seek only trashy women.......
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> it usually just flows on from there.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> how would dat fell to u baby?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> words r words and mean nothing at all unless there is action to back it up.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> You would do anything for them......  1.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> No, I would never do that!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> i am scared he wont give his heart to me in full.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> we feel the same  your question answer it self
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> it might not be his fault after all.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> Give it a try and good luck!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> if your into it go for it!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> No it's not cheating.. it's just you fantasizing.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> if your wife won't take nude pictures, maybe she's unconfortable in her own skin.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> or ask her to the movies or something like that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i'm positive that someone will love you one day
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> if the first happens, don't worry, you'll get it up again, if the second happens great!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> At least as much maybe more!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> They DON'T work in real life.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> They have the theme rooms etc.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> yes ur not only a whore ur a slut!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> and wll these feelings all pass?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> first of all, do you really hate them?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Dont ever do something like that because in the long run it comes back to hunt you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Chat and ask if she would like to have coffee IN THE MUSEUM cafe.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> this will be in june and I don't want my future wife disappointed
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> As far as men wanting to get married early I havent seen that where Im from.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> How I can say the dumbest thing and he still finds it funny.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Because I think that I did.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> perk them up tell them a really funny joke
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> It doesn't have to be anywhere fancy, just somewhere special to You guys.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> Girls like it when they think the guy actually pays attention to more than her boobs!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> I know when I came out to my mother she said Oh, your not funny like that!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> drop something infront of her and say hi that will start it 4 u
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> everything seems so much easier now.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_30> yes two girls like me what do i do.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> its not so much that we like girls, we just like the sex.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> just be yourself and find someone who cares u .
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> you can buy what you want or need.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> get her a cute little stuffed animal.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> or wave to him in the hallway.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> Jeez, what the hell kind of question was that?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Also you just have to get to know her better.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> I dont think so my dad is a cop and statitory rape is seriouse business
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> i don't know....you should wait for your soul mate...
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> Then go where these people go.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> well that happened to me but i wasnt pregnant and she diffently wasnt a size 4!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> Just look at Eminem and his wife.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> or is she sum 1 ur wanting 2 talk 2?
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> just be urself a woman loves a honest guy.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> We also went to dinner, that was plenty for me!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> it depends what people will think about you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> he doesnt want me to leave cause he wants to be with me all the time.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> but nothing wrong by marrying anyone you find on the street.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> but if u really like all of them pick one.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> And FYI: Not all guys play games.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> that's the explination.they can't be faithful unless the one true love strikes them over the head.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> It hard but there are some mean out there they're just hard to find
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> i told my friend that too.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> by the way i am o.k.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> the other girl is after one thing, and its in your pants...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> If she takes off her pants and sits on your lap....you got good chances.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> :)  Wish you all the luck in the world... Cheers-Danae
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Its probably good idea talk it out with him.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> I mean after all that`s all girls do to guys.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> It's not right to say hey your an a**hole because your hot.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> it's very simple...tell her to back off in a nice way...honesty is the best policy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Many men are just like that with breasts.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> Just don't get your hopes up too much...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> i'm sure you will find some body, keep looking.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> and that's how to prove his to love to u. then u go that city.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> but my absolutly beutiful wife married me and I look like an idiot
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> neither am i. i am a nigerian dude looking for the same  thing!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> whenever u and your wife happy can share the night with outside dinner
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> you ladies should just come out and say ~ Pound da s**t outta my cootchie please!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> How can I get my best friend (guy) to join me and my 'girlfriend' in bed...?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> though if you love each other love will find a way its way back for both of you.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> if you prefer the postal way it is also possible
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> not only for your soul but for your health.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> don't date him- it'll be trouble!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Start slow - join a club or team or choir or other group that has girls in it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Looks like hooked on phonics didn't work for you
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> you cheap #@!$* just kidding, how much was the watch?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> its the most special feeling you will ever have.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> If you can't trust each other, why would you even THINK of getting married?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> Well you don't really say what or how he's abusive.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> U need 2 ask him that honey.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> you should not be thinking about marraige if he does not trust you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> and he has lost his romance
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_10> SEE WHAT MADE YOUR MAN CHANGE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> and make the best you can out of your life.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> Is he the only guy you can get?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> YOU WILL NOT FIND TRUE HAPPINESS WHEN YOU LOOK OUTSIDE YOUR MARRIAGE.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> Just go up and say hi.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> Or just say hey whats up?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> just be your self  and be honest.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> its really hard to say what is average.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> just expose yourself to him ;) works every time...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> who the hell sees you like an object????????
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Yes harry larry, you're a whore.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> then left him hanging and i feel really bad.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> hot girl get it while you can : P no im just kidding im not THAT insensitive.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> First off, never, NEVER EVER answer a question like that from a woman!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> if u mean a hickey than, rub a lipstick cover over it and twist it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Kill yourself, then you are the one dying, and that should make everyone happy.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> um no that just screams immature!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> And all that is called L.O.V.E!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> sounds like you just had a bad breakup and he doesnt want to be a rebound boy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> ask me my code name is iverson
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> don't... love your life and self first if you wanted to love other person..
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Some people don't get hit on at all.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> be yourself go up to her and ask her she is doing.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> You know, that is asked alot by girls.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> then just get talking about deeper things, not like, so, how's life?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> hiiii this matter is about love
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> You get high frome their scent.....  3.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> TRy talking about your boyfriend or girlfriend.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> if you have any more questions like that don't be afraid to email me at:                iceskater_ashley@yahoo.com
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> WELL THATS WHAT I WOULD DO!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> IT'S  EITHER THEY HAVE IT OR THEY DON'T
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> or start with just a bra and pantes first.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> probably he's self-conscious and has a lot on his mind..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> F. She thinks you are lying?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> dont feel ugly if you know that you are pretty.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> What if you had gotten married then all this happened??
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> you can rub my feet anytime
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> Just make sure you swim well.......and buy some wellies!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> Um...we're just like any other kind of girl!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> But if you love him you need to tell him.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> i am sure i cant be the only one out there looking for a guy like you!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> kiss.com ... that's where i met my honey :)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> Give him head while doing it.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> if u dont voice out u dont get it.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_25> If she has a boyfriend, and she's happy, then back off!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> U can always ask her friends too.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> HOWEVER----i find him looking at me every now and then.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Ask him yourself if he wants to go out with you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> If he is, dont allow him to hurt you- leave him right away!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Is he teasing her a lot?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> if your friend really has a problem with them dating then talk to the guy.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> well its hard to talk about one's self :-D
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> i like an average girl and she is very pretty, but shy to some people.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> talk about something she might interested in, or a movie
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> Thats All you have to do.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> Just try giving him some hints , like tossing your hair etc.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> So no we aren't always trying to be nosy.
<NbChars_250> <LevSim_30> you are afraid of losing .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> You forget what she looks like?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Her name is megan and she likes me so much.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> And you cant sweat this crap beacuse, you loved a hoe.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> You should wait untill it feels like the right moment, whatever you do don't RUSH!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> But alot of men and some younger boys look at a woman as a whole package.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> You have to be In love to know what it is
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> Yes, most guys ask girls out, but hey, you've got to give us a sign!!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> cuz i am thinking about doing it
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> move on, there was an obvious reason it didn't work out the first time.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> If you touch, lay, make a move, etc.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> u will marry in same age that HE (your true love and friend) desides marry u,too
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Stop looking and wait for her to come to you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> what restaurants are you going to?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> Just say happy birthday and that's it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> FYI...it only takes 4 to penitrate.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> When will I get my chance?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> now I have to get off here and go snuggle up... See ya later!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> dont do this until you are sure you are ready .
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> so on,on,on, something you are doing, is saying to them come and get you????????
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> just be real tell her whats on your mind tell her wat you fell she will be very happy
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> take her to a movie that she likes
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> well im a guy and i know how it is.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> OMG why would you send somebody a copy of your ID?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> yes i am.. and after 5 years, we are still in love
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> Aslong as she is using it correctly you guys will not get pregnant.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> depends on how mature they are?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> First, would your brother care if you started a relationship with this guy?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Just think of it that way.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> you get that warm fuzzy damp feeling in your blue jeans
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> maybe u didnt include them with it.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> cant save a life with words.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> lots of random posts tonight huh?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> not all women..  take it from me..
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> money  if you have money you don't need anything else.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> since you are shy, maybe hang out with some of your friends when you flirt with him.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> If she's your girlfriend why would you need to impress her?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Either way, you don't have what she wants RIGHT NOW.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> IF IT'S BAD, SEEK COUNSELING, AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK, JUST END IT.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> if you dont know that..then your numb!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i think you should get a plane ticket and go see him!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Well me myself... i am still a virgin and yes sometimes i feel embarrassed to tell people it.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> Plus, there are just the people that get pregnant on the pill, even with perfect usage.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> me, im the best choice hands down
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> I want a reply from you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> have you ever tried yahoo personals or eharmony.com or other dating services.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> no, hanging out with friends or going to outragous partys is the only way to have real fun.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> If she knows you like her then just chill.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> Or the signs are there (guys checking you out), but ur just not reading them.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> what do you think i should do??
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> I care about him a lot..but sometimes I wonder if it's truly love.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> you're not insecure, you just see through his crap.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> and put down a towel, no one wants to sit in the wetspot
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Get the ball rolling and keep going.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> if you don't, then let some other person help or just give them a little quit time.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> STAND UP FOR YOURSELF, START LETTING PEOPLE EXACTLY HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT BEING ABUSED!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> cause u should b. i guess, thats just wat we hpoe
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> but check it out usually between the age of 35 and 45 HA prime time
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> 3 Tell yourself I can't do this now and mentally lay it aside
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> if u wanna be a virgin b4 marriage, maybe 17 or 18.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> try your best to see it yourself first.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Do some guys like this or will I just need to fake how I am to keep someone?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> u shouldn't have any doubts in ur mind about them.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> You read their texts over and over again.....  11.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> did u run out of medication or is therapy school on break!?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> ...oh, you're a really sweet sounding guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> For example, if you just sit there straight faced then it sends a message that you don't care.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> no offense or anything but i dont think las vegas is a good place to get married
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> She is who she is...... like it or leave it!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> no really it is a form of herpes but not the kinda u worried about
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> i love well formed females under five foot, really,
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> if that is the cause you never had nothing with him to begian with as far as prettier .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> us girls are twisted, dont try to understand us.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> If not then go for it all the way but except what ever come from it...
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> Im a girl i knows boyz like black boyz they like the gurl booty than the beauty..
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> AND I WAS GONNA GET A JOB AND YOU STOPPED ME FROM GETTING IT.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> Yo son if u really want a girl to like u you got to be urself.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> i only admit it to ppl who i knw r virgins too.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> yes.i don't think there's any problem in it.but if he has some other good qualities also.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> second i think you are too young to have a g/f.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> but says he doesn't want to go with you and doesn't want to, and doesn't tell you why???
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> so they can pick lettuce while they cruise :) dont worry, i am mexican!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> what should i do if my best friend was macking on my boyfriend
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> you better stay away from jail man.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_40> If myles is the one you want then get him back.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> if he doesnt like it move on.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> Ok, im a very straight guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> you ignore her acitvity & works
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> But girls are like that too, always think they're not cute, sorta gets annoying.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> eat lots of chocolate and ben and jerrys new york fudge chunk ice cream.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> i'm sure there is somebody out there for u.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Nice looking women treat men good too.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Just don't let random hot women get to you.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> the first time i had sex i was 9.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> If you still want to play around then don't get married.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> in person would be the best over the phone just shows what a coward they are!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> he might get turned off on it too and you might be able to have a little fun.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> if you were gay why wouldn't you want to married to the person you love.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> Show him that you care and still want to be friends if you two broke up!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> We got married 10 1/2 years ago, even though I never proposed!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> AND the food isn't that good and the beer selection is lacking!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> I just told my friend i have strong feelings for her.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> Well i hope things work out for u and  GOOD LUCK to u l8r
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> You acually mean girl or women?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> for a real bf, you should be 18.......but can be younger if just a buddy
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> Not u. Alot of guys are hoes and want there di** to fall off.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> guys are afraid of being made a joke of and turned down
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> find a girl u like and do any crazy thing to get the date
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> thats the last thing you should feel
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> be honest and forward dont beat around the bush, it will only make it worse
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Besides how do you know the guy who wants a fling will love you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i don't think it's odd if that's what he wants from you.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> Don't you think that kids back then snuck the occasional peek.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> First of all your boyfriend shouldnt lie!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> No, it was a fling...I don't think his girlfriend would like it....
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> :( But i sure love it.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> SEX TOO IS ONLY PLEASE WHEN IT IS DONE.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> is it because you are expecting him he'd love you the way you love him?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> 4) Waiting -- to see what you are REALLY about .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> but l luv my hubby with all my heart and l wont want this to continue.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> don't do the same things, try to spice it up my doing new things.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> his family rejected that coz of my age!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Not only did he rape your girl, but he was your so called friend.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> Cheater or man with something to hide!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> !IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> if you know them well ask them whats up.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> if things turn sour in the relationship with your boss then things can turn sour on your job.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> don't fake because if it turns serious they will notice.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> if they always in your face smilin
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> LOOK TO SEE WHAT HAD HAPPEN IN THE TIME OF MARRAGE.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> I guess boys should be after girls not men!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Thats a lot of stress you don't need right now!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> should love me always.and shold be romantic.and she shold be hot.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> and try and figure out-what happened,here.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> to avoid answering the real answers
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> id personally love both =] but id rather be loved.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i just want to ask for opinions that would best fit my question.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> The bigger they are, the more they get in your way!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> dude, i'm goin through the same shit right now.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> because you're a baby and can't get over it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> These are questions that good - caring women look for.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> from my own personal experience...just try to be funny!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> men can touch their balls women can't
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> like: not to start talking to him/her, not asking about him/her, not answeering him/her for along time...etc !
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> the best thing he ever did to me was when he bought me the first rose.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> If you marry her, you could rub her feet for life!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> you know there have to be blondes mixed into this
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> youre nuts leave the guy alone
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> probably girls always want wat they cant have
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> How well do you know this man?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> My friend cheats on his girlfriend because girls beg him too.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> or maybe she just doesn't want to
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> being a guy, it is embarasin wen ur 24!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> and given that i am not in that setting i don't know what is driving that.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> when she starts playing around with you and talking to you a lot.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> She my friend is haveind her frist kid
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Now you have to take an STD screen every 6 months for the next 3 years.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> 8 years together she still looks great.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> i think every single gurl who is looking......looks for a a real loving, understanding, caring man !!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Ok, ask her to go outside in the parking lot with u becuz u need some air.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Or at least the ones I've asked do.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> This isn't why he said it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Looks like you got the point.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> What ever you do' dont stay with a cheater.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> my sympathies, but just tell everyone straight up
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> see i use to date this fat guy, until he broke up with me.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> No, a guy can't be too nice.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Are you sober right now...this seems like a pretty sappy question.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Dont ask always.... tell about yourself, your dreams, ur goals ...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> which i thik is so nasty since i have a bf!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> a skirt it is more comfortable for a girl and sexy for guys
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> im 15 he's 18 and in college he loves me to but we decided it wont work.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> Then find out what she is into...then go to her and say I heard you like(mexican?
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> first thing u gotta do is stop spending so uch time on the computer asking dumb ass questions.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> Maybe you should just leave her be.... she might be trying to help him get to heaven faster!
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> It just might knock his socks off.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> THATS EASY, ME GETTO TACO BELL !!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> If it is your first time yea it prob.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> this guy has serious issues...log off/sign out immediately and dont EVER EVER contact him again!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> you cant make him love you.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> do some thing u enjoy if ur date enjoys it too then u have some thing in common
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> things will go smoothly if you try this.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> they aren't complicated at all... self centered is the proper terminology
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> But thank god we tried it out first!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> and if you get told no, so what!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> nothng wrong, it could be just fear.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Be stick on that and you will be succeed...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> was there a reason you guys waited 3yrs to get married?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Don't trust other people, no matter who they are.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> or just stay seprated if your in no hurry wait him out and mabie he will file
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_5> SOMETHING THE BOTH OF YOU NEVER EXPERIENCE TOGETHER.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> females be tryna play wit guy's heads.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Don't worry about the boyfriend stuff.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> why i did u have 2 break up wit him wen u new u liked him
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> If shes really one, you outta luck.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Um...I meen smooth talk her, get close, and invite her over.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> so it can happen!...Anyways hope this helped!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> But they can't be any guys you have to be close to them.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> I recently had a great guy friend kiss me.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> your husband can't control your mind!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> What would having your picture back accomplish?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> no...as far as i know, he's not dating anyone right now
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> Then, do what you like to do.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_20> Shaved looks like a little girl, and i don't want a woman to look pre-pubescent.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> 1 just being that he's not divorced yet.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> If you want to, then go ahead.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> i did like the taco bell answer.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> But....like sunshine suggested.....read up on it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> It's like some weird animal instinct.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> MAYBE YOU NEED TO TRY SOMETHING NEW WITH HER.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> when you figure this one out please let me know
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> just be yourself...do NOT try to be something you're not!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> everywhere, they are like grocery stores all over the place
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> you should be like wow girl you are so cute whats your name
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> I NEED MORE INFORMATION TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Umm...no panties would actually be more comfortable than butt floss.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> People conversate with other people all the time!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> PLUS I'd rather not choke myself :p
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> They really don't, it's just how they communicate.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> sex at the neighborhood park in the daytime(nobody was there).
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> not on the first date but def on the 2nd!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> give her a large teddy bear and ask her to pose with it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I felt like I was kissing mushmouth!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> why are all the HOT boys jerks and the ugly boys are nice?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> STAY LOYAL TO THE GUY YOUR MARRIED TO, DONT CHEAT!!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> lolz...n e wayz first of all, do u noe the gurl?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> worked for her with her family.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> get her fav flovers,chcolate, your love.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> you shouldnt feel ugly and unwanted just cause a guy treats you like shit.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> So, until then, I think I'll just hang out and have friends.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> hope i help u even a little...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> If you don't want suprises then next time tell him what you would like.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> or you love him the way he is?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Just always be there and she will eventually warm up to u.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> move on it will be the best for both in the end
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> Now we broke up now his friend wants me.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> maybe not, but if u want to know just how he is, u can mail him asking that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> because they want to get girls  duhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> But right after youv dumped the now-chow, and your ex starts flirting, id go back to now-man.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> and in same girls like boys 2 becz boys have those things which girls have not.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> quick answer: our brains actually function differently!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Depends how much you like them.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> Then, you should probably see why they tease u.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> so i get to be close to a girl with out having them wanting to suck me off.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> as they get older they get more 'guts'
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Many ugly guys care about only sex.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> yes it is and when you do people will know you are an easy sl[ut
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> cuz iranian guys r loyal,truthfull and care for the family.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> If you don't want to, then don't.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> If he wants to go then shut up about it already and go.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> some people hang around you for what they can get.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> ANY ONE THAT CAN CONTROL NATURE CAN STAY AWAY FROM SEX.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> When YOU know what you want.... Then YOU will know what you truely need.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> and in the end is it really worth it?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> cause guys are stupid and like 2 show off 2 anyone and everyone.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> If they were to say 100%...yeah, then they could be sued.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> give me as much response as possible
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> you can never get that trust back, so move on.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> get some hard proof...like a police report, etc.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> i met my man from online.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> and fined out wha shes into!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> man can give to his women love and all what she like
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> maybe he loved what you were like to him at that moment.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> no matter how hard you try, you can't help who you love no matter what they do to you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Depends on how good looking the ex is ;)
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> touch wood i hope i dnt change my views!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> Mayb ur having an affair with him coz u still love him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> he might be better than your ex.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> and ask yourself what you might be doing wrong.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> i think u got wat i mean.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> then ask the dude u hate how his love life goin.then tell her ur real fellings
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_30> Get out while  you can!Your lover may go psycho on  you!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> don't bother yourself with him, move on and forget about him.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> once they're done crying, manhandle them and spank them.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> people m waiting for some good answer
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Ya-we do or at least I do, but I don't think about it every 12 seconds!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> your girlfriend doesn't want you asking about other girls expecially her friends.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> don't tell him you love him .
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_90> If you have to ask youll never know
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> My best Guess being a Guy , Is there is sum1 else in tha Mix...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> by a chance do u know anyone that live in the same state with her?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> No if ands or buts about it!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Just speak, strike up a convo and get to know eachother!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> Just do what your heart tells you at least your real about it to her
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Just say it Einstein...not all that hard...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> It's like most guy's wildest dreams  have a threesome... he's crazy if he won't.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> u gotta get OFF of that fear man, i mean lifes to short for that kinda shit.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> give a big smile and say HEY
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> just ask her out on a movie.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> what kinda music are you listening to?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> NOTHING MUCH JUST THE SIMPLE FACT THAT HE CARES
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> People who don't type in all capitals...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> your mom, they have surprisingly good advice sometimes
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> It's like asking why do some people go for Coca Cola and others for Pepsi... or something like that!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> It just depends on the girl.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Guys are afraid of women with brains, and they humiliate them to boost up their own selfesteem!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> TAKE THE TIME TO LOOK AT EACH OTHER AND ASK YOURSELVES IF YOU LOVE EACH OTHER.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> I told her to ask him when he came in the house call she hung up in my face.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> becz the girls have those things which boys have not.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Kick his arse to the kerb.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_30> but a 6-7 inch is nice!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> its fate u'll get to them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yes, and it rained today, and i had peaches for lunch.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> no i have never been to england.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> How about in choosing a mate?!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> i kno sumone n i want 2 find out information bout him.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> overall, wait, don't force ANYTHING AT ALL!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> I bet he would get a real kick out of serving you :)  Have fun!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> Of course you don't like to complain... YOU ARE THE FIXER of problems.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> but for sure not everybody is telling the truth on the net.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> your Avatar doesn't help at all!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> I told him I liked him and gave him my phone # he just tore it up.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> MY GUESS IS THAT YOU NEVER DID BUT, PERHAPS YOU COULD LEARN TO LOVE EACH OTHER?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> did he dump you or did you dump him.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> For the same EXACT reason hot girls are bit**es and ugly ones are nice as can be!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> I once went out with this guy and he broke my heart.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Have your own Style & be Cool ... Act like you are already in a relationship !
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> But be real and dont try to be fake.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_15> MOVIE OR BRING HER TO UR HOUSE AND GET DOWN AND DIRTY.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> THINGS THAT YOU COULD SHARE THAT YOU HAVE IN COMMON.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> don't go crazy trying to impress her.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> stay away from these people at all costs!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> well, u probably look like a guy that they can trust.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> 2. he doesn't care about her or her reaction.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> so you've actually seen a guy slap a girl?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> And there are lots of good non-Iranian guys.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Im not an american to understand what do hicking means.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> i really hoped i helped, even just a lil bit.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> no i go out with people i love.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> even condoms don't gurrantee 100% protection
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> just try going to da club on a singles night or something.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> there is no such thing just be yourself when you talk to someone
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> if she's nuts, then she'll probably say every day, which if you can afford that then hey, no stress.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> once i was,  don't be in a rush getting fucked isnt all its cracked up to be.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> not really, you have to be the judge
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Falling in love over typed words and web cams only is not so hot.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Tell him that you didn't mean to hurt him!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> And thats' what I think you should do!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> why would you want to know, thats gross.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> no i do not but its easy to find her just go to yellowpages.com
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> this is really a question up 2 u. but i say do what ur heart fells.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> just his kindness and love, because he is so nice and loving and i don't need much
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Ambitous, successful, intelligent, educated... oh wait you said dream girl right?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> There are sensitive caring men out there who don't let their penis make their decisions.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> Starting over is a hard step for me, I can not open up yet.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> and what if your boyfriend findsout how would he feel.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> and hope i have answered you on this matter
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> or was that just all a fantasy?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Why Don't Guys lay back for a lil' while.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> :P  I wouldn't want to share my husband with anyone...ever.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> Hon, why don't you trust your insticts?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> And you know him better than her, right??
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> So could you share some of that with me???
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> I HAVE BEEN VERY SHY SINCE BIRTH BUT GETTING RID OF IT.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> Why not tell the girl the truth!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> Tell her you Love her every min of the day,Well.it works for me :P
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> this is a really hard one.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> Then if they get mad and start yelling, gag them.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> i was going to say not until you said the X cheated on you.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> if u r honest with ur relationship then u make a guy intersted in u.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> Dont take him back- even if he was drinking or not.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> If you like someone let 'em know I always say but I guess I'm wrong!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> GEEEEEZE My Valentines' chocolate is long gone!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> Janu,sweety pie,lolly pop,this one did it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> i am not trying to be mean but you need some help.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> C. She does nothing for you?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> yep... and we have a baby.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> if not you need to stop and think and think hard and long.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> find people in chat rooms and ask if they want to be penpals
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> dont even GO on the webcam anymore!!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> i know it's crazy... but it's true
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> not happy that he still see's the ex on occasions and dosent care if i am not o.k.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_35> color is only skin deep....it dont matter until you get to the inside.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> And to hurt someone that truly cares about you is bad karma.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> I don't do anything that hurts someone else.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Well mine is 10inches long and 3 inches thick But thats just mine care to try it out
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> IF you truly loved him....it wouldn't bother you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> Jewlery wise...Something simple but not cheap..Like a Necklace or cute braclet... Music..who dont like music!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> you have to kno what there into for ins.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> but pls don't get ugly, just to find that guy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Dpon't pull a shakespeare, don't force it out.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> If you know what I mean
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> but that is what sisters are supose to think
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Because hot guys don't have to try hard to win affection.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_45> of cos they can get into homo or want to be homo.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> goggle web and you find what you are looking for.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> what if he blew the best job opportunity you ever had by insulting your future boss.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> Energy is good but too much is pretty annoying!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Why haven't I had one yet and should I tell him that he really isn't the first.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> So it really is up to you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> i love sex so very much, but can barely ever get my boyfriend to have sex with me.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> :) Best of luck to you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> buy here a movie that she said was a favorite.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> may be you should say you're looking for something bigger.. :)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> So obviously she just wasn't good enough for him and you are.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> show him that youre better with out him.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> Don't be arrogant, women hate that.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> im the most popular kid in my 8th grade class and a big jock.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> youre probably shy because you're afraid to make the wrong impression on him.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> They don't know him like I know him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> clearly something is wrong, yet they wont admitt it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> I black i went though it...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> I know his is alot but i had it on my mind for a while.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> 'cause the smokin hot ones think their too good for you or sumtin like that, so that never lasts.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> pick any good guys out, the rest you can blast away with a shotgun!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> oh no, they ar superior(this is what 90% think about girls), and for them sex is beter then humor.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> The pain .... oh the pain of losing the one.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Because it is sexy and makes charlie stand at attention
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> I don't now but they look like it hurts
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> Cuz if it vibrates well then....
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> she had no answer to me.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> Why not he's single unless he's committed
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Start there and see where it leads.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> often, but most don't act on it.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> He wasn't and that was for sure.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> i don't want any one-word answers.. i need details.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> Well some say this or something like it, but then they go ahead and do it anyway.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> why else would more than one girl use that as an excuse?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Once or twice a week would be nice I think.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_30> let him see the true you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> u should go to a mental hospital first to be able to answer that question...
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> If she still gets mad GET RID OF HER.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> how could you not have both?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Dang...My first reaction is to tell you to run like hell b/c people on the internet can be nuts!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> i would think one that is very desperate.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> Go ahead with your life, don't bother him.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> The are times i dont feel like making luv.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> all u have to do is find the irl they think he raped and ask her
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> 96% of all men have at least cheated once!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> WHY DO U MAKE ME SEEM TO BE SO BAD.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> A decent guy expects nothin but love.. Make him yours by just showin u care for him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Hell yeah it hurts the first time, when you are the woman anyways...but after that, it is great!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you're probably just looking in the wrong spots... but yeah, eventually you'll find your special sumone...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> it will be hard, but if you dont do it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> But don't let him think you don't like him.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> wow....a guy in need of help huh?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> so go ahead wit yo self and do ur thang.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> on the cheek or on the back of my neck.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> You sound like a caring and sensitive person that does not deserve such BS
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> And then obviously: go to a bar with a friend and see if any guys hit on you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> probably not at first, then it depends on what type of person you are
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_40> He said to leave him alone and you are not.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> :-) they are sweet romantic spots.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_20> question: how far is her place from u?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> May I throw my hat in the ring?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> (your treat of course and of her choice) and take it from there
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> i was but i just found out that hes a hoe.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> eah i guess if they do it at home but not at chruchnot with every body there
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> she can use it to cover.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> you could try a marriage counciler
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> I expect nothing and hope for something really nice!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> not even us girls know....hahahahah  its hopeless!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> seeing a good marriage adviser is great idea
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> but if u can't control it, confront them all.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> ask yourself why u dont want him to
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> So we can just go crazy??
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> If you pick Myles then you should want him enough to tell Ryan to get a life.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> THEN LEAVE HIM ONE AS YOU GO OUT THE DOOR.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> i hope that answers ur question.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> (haha..ur getting advice from a 15 yer old =P)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> a lady who is not into just one thing, but opens her mind and body to both.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> They're out there, those good girls, you just have to look hard.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> nope,, everything that is too much is bad !
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> I will just say right off the bat...
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> She expressed interest, I said, thanks but I like WOMEN.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> but better dont have to much hopes, in this things of love its always women get hurt!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> thats kinda weird, dont ya think?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> If he cheated once odds are he will again.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Now that I saw it and asked about it, he said he was just looking for new friends.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Well i cant give u that much advise b/c im the same way!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> maybe because he's still hiting it on the side.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> His little sister said she'd spit in my baby's face
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> if no, I'm not for you
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> IF so then NO...if it is then possibly so.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> The fact that is is dating you and she is your best friend makes it really bad.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> no she is a slut and not worth dateing anymore
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> HOW AM I TO BELIVE YOU.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Because she has a history with your guy!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> in my opinion once a cheat alwasy a cheat i would leave him alone!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> dont know i met my wife on the internet
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> or does it feel different to you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> Be yourself Be nice Be a Good boy!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> YOU SAY YOU LIKE THIS OTHER GUY, BUT I'M SURE YOU LOVE YOUR HUSBAND.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> And i have worked very hard for the place i have and the things i have.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> I've seen some beautiful girls, yes, but so too have I seen some nasty stuff.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> i would move on, but keep in contact with him as friend
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Lois, being a guy, I actually ran inot this situation once.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> And why cant they stick to just one woman
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Just go ahead and talk to her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> What.. Did you just go see brokeback mountain?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> same thing happens to me just be cool and pretend you hate him (no effence)
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> dont get me wrong-am not in the habit 4 casual affairs!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> if you both broke up because of differences .
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> stay away, there are better ways
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> Or maybe because you are just getting more mature and realize that marriage isn't only about sex.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> what if i didnt want u to do something u really wanted to do?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> But really it's just where society's at right now.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> Other way around, it's really complicated, if you know what I mean.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> unless their friend is understandingthey shoulden't.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> A bad 80's outfit with big hair and lots of pink neon
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_20> when ı was 15 and ı would hate ıt
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> no, if she loves you and choose to be with you, then you have nothing to worry about.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> I'am newly out of a 19 yr marriage myself.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_20> not to give photo id and yes i think its enough
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> Some women may not want it everyday, but maybe once or twice a week.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> Try yahoo people search, I got some useful information there.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> no, but he does have crushes on certain celebs.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> how old are u, get back to me, ejy1@sbcglobal.net
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> It means that they did not care about your feelings and just cared about their own.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> i will ask for help when i need it.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> Maybe hint in at first as to not scare her..lol Have fun!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> :) The Americans have some hot competition...
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> Guess I always think of that saying: Do good and you'll find good
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> i'm in tx so the laws are different, but u can find it thru a search online.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> is it real that girls like gifts all the time from their boyfriends ??
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> If you really love him, then try again.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> i dont expect much just some one on one time together
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> maybe- who knows?- you might fall in love with her too :)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> I WANT TO DO THIS EVERY TIME.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> Definantly an alright girl who is loyal.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> If he's not that is sick and wrong.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> Be happy that u dont have bf..live freely and enjoy life
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> plus they dont hit on me!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> You can also do some secret admirer stuff, thats if u really really like her.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> Gotta go, this turned me on!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> a day...i used to go 4-5 times a day, but now adays once and be careful
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> if you choke smile but don't get embarassed and say theres a chip stuck in my throat, just playing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> do not date at work unless you dont care about your job.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> be the best man in her world
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> Is he actually dating her or just checking her out alot?

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Have you asked him if he is seeing someone else?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> not only could they help but they can also buy you some Ben &Jerry's icecream!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> friends r the key 2 every gurl, trust me.

<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> I don't see anything wrong with it at all.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> he is your brother why would you think otherwise about him unless you're sick.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> !i mean they are rare.....like an endangered species.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> by doing just what he wants...i guess i can't please him!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> whatever has meaning to her, or just pamper her on the 14th.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> YOU ARE PERFECTLY NORMAL GIRL, THAT'S THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSSED TO GO.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> I WANT SOME ONE ELSE'S OPINION.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> and i bet you feel like i do, all confused and frustrated.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> actually, you sound like exactly the type of guy i am looking for.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> why in the hell would you want your friends ex and youalready know whats going to happen.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> That doesn't mean I'm out to marry 'em.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> well ya, how do u think people start to talk to each other.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> If you want a Hickey removed...don't get one in the first place!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> Has a few issues it seems, maybe paranoya is the biggest...move on..he's not the one
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> YOU LIKE HIM, OR YOU LIKE THAT HE PAYS ATTENTION TO YOU?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> sit down and make up a list on paper what you are looking for.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> is that what u can alone think of ?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> if you dont liek him hes not the one!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> HELL YEAH GO OUT WITH HIS FRIEND IF YOU LIKE HIM
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Some say..If you lust after a peron... you already slept with then in your heart/mind.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> in person would be appropiate but if things are going to get ugly the phone is a better option
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> If she knows your a virgin, she may want to lead!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> OTHERWISE YOU TAKE A CHANCE ON GETTING WHAT YOU DONT REALLY WANT.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> I really like but I just can't find the words to ask her out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Take your time, have fun, and EXPLORE!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> i have 4 brothers and no sisters.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Once you meet the girl of your dreams.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> You should flirt with one his friends and he would get mad.If not act like you don't care.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> im sure you wont have a problem if all you say is true.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Dont, suggest all going back to yours for a group sex session!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> so you have to consider what kind of a mate you would be.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Love is better than lust, right??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> i think we are counterparts of the one another.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Not cheating unless you actually act on it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> If he respected you in the first place, he wouldn't have done it anyway.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> it would be like a regresion in my growth.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> I guess that's why there aren't that many redheads.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> yes u shouldint let someone git hert like that.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> a girl did that to me and i fell into her trap, even though she is far from perfect....
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> in some case if she doesn't ask u... just wait.if not it's ok.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Not you and all your stupid questions!
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_40> is it smaller than your middle finger...
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> you have to really dig yourself out of a hole.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> but it all happen when he/she confused whethr he loves u or not.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> if you aint seen him for 16 days surely thaty tells you something!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Got a girlfriend... then wait 1 month and become monogomous and check her checked first
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> If he likes you then start hanging out with him.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_10> SORRY (OLD LADY WHO WILL DIE WITH CATS)(LOL)
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> take her/him to the beach n have a picnic w/ them.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> Oh ya I'm 24 and he's 18 :-)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> ive heard a boy-toy or just called a lover.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> but he was so nice to me!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> Im going to say NO because what else have you got....
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> But i dont know much about it, my bf is muslim (turkish) and i'm pagan.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> u know how can u be sure he doesn't want that girl.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_20> i cant believe you are so hypercritical!!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> OPEN YOUR EYES GIRL YOU HAVE A FUTURE GO WHERE EVER YOU HAVE TO YOU'LL FIND SOME ONE BETTER
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> i told them that they needed to get their head examined.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> 2.But ur guy gets the chemistry here...He acts as if stilllll your best friend ...!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> ONLY you can decide that...  Do you care?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> well, if you ever need anything let me know.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> You know what we all want !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> That kills the mood and you have to stop and start all over again.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Well that's pretty tough...Well be her friend you know talk to and stuff.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> Don't try to impress her with money or looks.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> that and a few other things too
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> it depends on what kingd of cheating
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> 4chan.com's /b/ is pretty gay..some times
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Listen Kid, you're just a freak.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> Have you guys met face to face?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Do you mean like a pen pal.
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_35> My ex and I are friends.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> They become all you think about.......  4.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> Don't want to much to fast !
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_30> Then just chill alittle to give both of you time!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> id take one that size anyday!!
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> Mentally - stop asking strangers and ask HER!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Don't rush things...life really goes by fast.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> And dont feel bad about it, he has problems.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> if so please contact me asap!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> i think iam always going to have a thing for him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> chacha77 is right, if he's too smooth he's probably a player
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> in a picture then ask if she will just take her bra off.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> I think it should be the guy but then again I'm pretty shy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> if you feel happy not giddy follow your heart but be up front and tell jhim ur feelings also
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> why dont you just visit her at home, bring her food, DVDs or anything she likes...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> just tell him it would be great to have a 3 some
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> There used to be LOTS of good girls out there...until the bad boys turned them around.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> what is a fiance of 2 kids?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> i was on the shot, and got pregnant with my third, pullout or use a condom.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> things aren't looking up for you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> I am, it sounds like ur a nice person who would really care about someone!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> IF you really love her yes.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> your looking to hard....let love come to you
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> the love with the other person just hits you and sticks.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_10> ASK YOUR FRIENDS IF THEY KNOW SOMEONE THAT HAS YOUR TRAITS AND QUALITIES.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> Ask him what's wrong or what are you thinking about or do you think we'll ever get married etc.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> If he's not cheating he's doing something bad.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> Sometimes it's just not about you...It's about him and you certainly can't control him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> You just have to be careful because their are some frauds online.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> men: write their name in the snow.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> so no im not embarrassed to admit it
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> put yo self out there man!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> have fun you are too young to be stuck with someone that doesn't like you!!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> cuz it aint no joy for an uptown boy who`s teacher just told him good bye
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> or you could just flat out tell him that you like his bestfriend.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> Work your way up from there.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> seriously, if a girl said that to me, i would know she meant business.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> plz plz plz anwser me baq thank you
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Eh, blanks are just wasted anyways.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> make it casual mayb that way u won't be so nervous.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Guys want girls who will make them feel like a man.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> WHICH WOULD MAKE HIM FEEL TRAP, AND RUN AWAY.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> I'm really sorry and I love u soo much
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> then you don't worry about but if he doesn't like you then get on.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> and you'll always have a date to lilith fair
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> If she says no, ask her what movies she likes.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> was a very bad boy but am now reformed.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> An girl that is loyal because I don't want some dumb girl that looks hot!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> flirt with him too maybe invite him over to your house
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> Because in the back of every man's head is a dream...a glorious dream!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Although, this does not mean that those pretty blue eyes will ever cheat on you again.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> but if she is cool about it, it's nice if she approches.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> I mean, wierder things have happened.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Ask her about her goals, and talk about you too
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_90> Pretend u r staight and ask him if he has a girlfriend
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> If they ask you to move on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i would have it evryday with my ex husband
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> I'm not saying it's not worth trying, I just think it's something to keep in mind.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Isn't she your girlfriend cause she already likes who you are?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> Cuz my friend dumped her bf thinkin he was cheatin on her and he wasnt so FOLLOW YOUR HEART!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> !at least you are a hill billy you are not supose to think about him that way
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> because i mean i reLLY don't know
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> If he cheated once on you, he will cheat again.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> but really if were up to me i wouldnt need sex ever again and still be happy with her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> and when you tell him dont be surprised if he asks can he experience it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> How is it that you even know that word at age 11????
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Don't say things like, 'lets stay friends....' because you really don't want to.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Dude, after that blind side, DO YOU REALLY want to fix things?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> And good luck with your surgery!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> once a cheater, always a cheater.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_25> Otherwise, 2 things:  1) Go gay  2) One word: prostitute
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> how about all yall come to class one day wearing saris?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> i was married 2 days before we did anything
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> when u will have 5 babies frm ur ex bfs
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> too late, idiots like you already can't respect women.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> what shall i do in this case ??
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> Firstly, not all women are like this.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> yes they are, and let them be like that, boys dont need to change hahaha
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> yes you should and tell him that you two made a mistake kissing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> He still promise me a good massage though.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> tell her what you think mabey she'll change her mind!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> he smells like perfume thats not urs
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> why not have many friends that are girls.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> if that's what your after, then knock yourself out.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> If you are dating a guy that a lot of girls like then the chances of them cheating increases.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Like they say, you dont knwo what you got till it's gone.. goodluck =)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> yeah sur as long as ur not good of friends
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> yeah sure some people wait till the right person
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> eyes ...they say it all .. use them ... :)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Not the typical flowers and candy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> We fuss and argue a lot over stupid things mostly..some really important tho.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> or if she's carrying somethin.. ask her if she needs help.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Then just start taking off her clothes!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> )food...want to go eat (at a nice resteraunt) with me friday night?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Don't get all hung up on your size.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> A GOOD GUIDE LINE OF RULES MUST BE IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE NO PARTNER STEPS ACROSS THE LINE.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_20> I'VE KNOWn HIM 6 MONTHS I LOVE BEING WITH HIM I AM SO IN LOVE WITH HIM (but) ...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> it means he's an ass and he digs yer friend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> you can't make a girl do anything.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> It feels weird though but yah.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Women pick up on subtle hints better than men, I think.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> somtimes romors are true but somtimes they arnt.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> im currently dating a man who's going to be a pastor too.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> some time i find my self liking a guy for reasons i don't know.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> try club love in D.C...and do what u gotta do man, ur liek what...30?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> DON'T EVER SETTLE FOR SECOND BEST!!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> She likes to talk to him alot!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> If you can cheat on guy #1, why not on guy #2?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> Tell your brother to HOOK you up girl shoooot!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> but i woudn't worry too much about it'll happen when it's right.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> coz they r confident with there self they dnt care about there weakneses.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_30> I mean, well, if you're a good guy, maybe I'll marry you (just kidding).
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> One thing I suggest is just don't bring it up.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> cuz thy jus wanna show off there body... and thy wanna look better than other guys!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> they are the best comfort when you have nobody to spend it with!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_50> back and forth and so on .
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> and you maybe thought a quick fix band-aid like marriage would be the glue/ to keep you guys togethter.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Since i was 16, alot of gay guys tried picking up on me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> he should go with the loyal girl...looks fade loyalty will always last...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> if i sa u in real life, i probably would think u where cute 2!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> You be romantic, if he likes it he will respond ;-)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> what kinda car are you driving?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> yeah pictures or something like that works .
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> Don't let one fool keep you down.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> what would a girl in 8-9th grade want from a guy in the same grade?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> ASK HIM IF HE CHEATED ON YOU!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Thats not to say I have slept around alot but I have been married 3x.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> good for you, did you just learn your number?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> But here's the weird part...she NEVER turns me down.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> Of course I would, why not?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> one more thing what state are you in seeya
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> if you miss him when he's not around you then you like him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> so just get a gun, aVibrator and a well paying job and u wont need a boyfriend!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> that doesn't mean that i wouldn't be friends with them.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Fool me once, same on you; fool me twice, shame on me.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> my problem is i don't have a big penus( about 5in erected).. and i only last about 4-6 min.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> None of my other friends (including me) thinks he's that great, especially since that boy gets in trouble...lots!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> 2nd dont be a brute if this happens
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> If he keeps lying, then he must not care for you all that much.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> I'll love to have two husbands...who joins me????
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> u sure will get screwed for asking this question by the yahoo answers team... Anyways.. how old are you?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Its totally out there, you just gotta go find it!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> I think getting married on the beach at sunset is more romantic, but that is just me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I don't think 18 is too young.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> Jealousy sucks and it eats away u inside trust me i know and it is'nt fun.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> there is nothing wrong in dating blacks, asians,whatsoever.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> i dont know about you guys but i cried when i read what yahooguru wrote!!!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> how can i get back in the dating game and trust and love agian.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> I don't mean to sound mean - But are you sure you REALLY LOVE HIM?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> girls   boys know what lust is but not love
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> From the male viewpoint...women, finances, women, cars, women, work, women...oh, did I fail to mention...WOMEN?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> women want both cause it feels good
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> no because i don't belive in that at all it is just based upon the stars!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_25> tell him maybe he likes you.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> No no no no.. Never go backwards.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> no dont avoid her coz of ur pride.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_25> So just buck up and say it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> by giving her a gift which you prefer: choose one & why?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> You never want to look back on your life and say Oh!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> ask him why and if he doesnt know than forget him
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> unless your 12 of course ;).
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> it is a challenage to a another female to get something she cant have.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> that's the most used excuse i have ever heard in my entire dating life.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> be adveture PLUS he'll love it!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> Sex 101: Women need romance, men need sex.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> (at least that is how my life has gone)
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> dont put that on the net
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> ), about issues that lead to marital failure.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> Guys have just the same problem and he might be too scared to ask you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> if she feels comfortable calling him daddy then u should let her do it...  maybe they have a bond...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> it kinda sounds like maybe he's not that into you anymore?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> then maybe you should hear them out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> ask me after 10 years .... maybe i'll have the answer .. oh poor I am
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> In short, Tell yourself your are worth more and LISTEN to yourself say it!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> I hope one day I can have them here with me :)
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> Can you please give me a list of things waht to talk about.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Sometimes you just have to say something shocking to get his attention like Oh yeah?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> at the end of the period?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> trust is the number one thing that makes a relationship like that tick, no matter how much youlove him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Probably did, so you didnt wait for the paper (marriage license) then, no different.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> yeah im all bout equal opportunity   if yur hot then yur hot thats all there is to it
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> this thime it is really over.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> most girls do by time there 25 to 30. blokes never do tho , if there that way inclined.lol
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> well first off ya aint gonna find a good one on the internet!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_20> HOMOSEXUALITY!...well i think it is anyway.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> but if you can't, then you know you really have found the one.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> plus it gives parents a chance to meet you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Just catch her eye and smile.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> They always want what they can't have.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> if e doesn't wanna tell don pressure im.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> i can undersatnd why u feel so......i myself hav felt so very often.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> dont worry me and my friend feel the same way about this other girl!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> whenever we are together, i always end up hitting him you know play fighing, its what highschoolers do.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> it would also help if it looked nice as its served.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> I always used to get in trouble for things but my brother would not.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> She probably doesn't want to talk, or maybe she's shy...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> you would probably have alot of fun sharing that experience together.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> I'm wondering why do you care if he breaks up with her?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> Try to get on with life.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_40> ppl these days are just ya know.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> a wonderful relationship with the one you like, and later you could love entirely.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_15> GUYS UNDER THE AGE OF 27 WILL TEND TO CHEAT ON WOMEN.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Im sick of living with no money In this shitty apt.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> if all fails go to a strip club!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> what girls can do to make u fall for her?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> about the freindship u hav to make him realise that we are just friends.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> he doesnt call me anymore he just comes over then hes gone the in the morning
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> MY WONDERFUL PESONALITY , AND OF COURSE MY GETTO ASS.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> Not fun....I felt bad for her kids too.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> cuz they are assholes and they dont deserve u
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> I had a lunch date with a beautiful woman once, but mostly she just led me on--does that count?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> a nagging woman is a man's worst dream.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> you could become a club referee (soccer) but you need to tale a class.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> dont be fooled just because he said he he loves you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> you have to do what your heart tells you to do.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> do stuff like you would do when you first meet.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> Or put on some of your favorite music and do karaoke!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> to give you money I guess  and for you to pick on them it seems
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> ask him if ur beautiful, sexy,or hott.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> The worst she'll do is say no, but you gotta try.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> If you make her laugh your in.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> But five years though....WELL, it's hard telling.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> you can't make her do anything.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> They never work and make you look like an idiot.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> ok I am dialing your number now!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> it could have been a wrong number.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> maybe she is embarrassed and feels weird just try to talk to her
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_20> I am one of those whose husband cheated!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> tell his other girlfriend what he said and see what happens.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> But him and I are still great friends.

<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> okay well good luck on figuring him out!

<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> I did 4800 Miles and I am Divorce now.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> He came back down..and he wants me back!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> That's just the way I see it now.

<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> but should i tell her i like him?
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_55> its risky if u get it from ur gf.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Even if you don't agree with them.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> I bet they are bed rooom eyes.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> what do you mean, you feel you're a girl?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> yes... happened to my gf too about 6 months later the treatment...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> I should have did/ said this- no REGRETS!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> But if you try to be a good friend, you can have so many great people around you!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> It sounds like you are a Christian.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> WHEN YOU ARE IN LOVE YOU WILL PUT THAT PERSON'S NEEDS BEFORE YOUR OWN.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> start making out with as many guys as you can.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> i dont think that is a smart idea.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Dear do not worry be trusted in god.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> And if you arn't then it should be easy becaue you don't know her!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> take it bac old skool on her and write a letter
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> By the way hubby and I have 3 kids and have been married almost 9 yrs...this time.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> yea... hes not worth your time n love if he doesnt care about u
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> 3) He stood me up for our new year date (Clue, he was with his Ex!)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> glad you ended it, but make no mistake.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> you'll learn a lot about that person and yourself.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> THATS NOT RIGHT JUST BEING WITH BOTH OF THEM IS ALREADY HURTING THEIR FEELINGS.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> yeah seriously, tell some one, aka ur parents, a teacher, clergy member, anyone u can trust that will help.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> I really liked this guy, he's smart, sexy, and really nice.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Cuz they can't compete with that
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> i dont want support, i want a really good reason cause i've think i've diproven them all.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Plus send her a BIG FAT check.And that is with out her knowing itwas you who sent it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> What a jerk - and the girlfriend is a bitch.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Like a loaded visa so she could buy her and her kids cloth toys and ect.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> or just wait for her to remember me??
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> thats ur job to do that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I tried calling but your line was busy!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> ;)  AND most importantly when you don't have to ask you KNOW.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Did you get a friend to tell her?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> LUST IS WHEN YOU SAY YOU'RE IN LOVE WHEN YOU JUST MET SOMEONE.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> i think but for introduce ur self by them.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Biggest joke played on man - size doesn't matter.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> god luck, i hope shes ok.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> i remember saying something about putting her up for adoption, because of what my dad said in real life.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> guys may insult you and some girls may not want to date you.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_20> sneek out and still see him
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> if a guy respect his partner enough i s'pose it depends on the guy.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> yours cause gay guys are gross.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> is this a kind of fantasy for him?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> just ask her some girls are to nice to say no
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> get to know her better and dont do it just to do it.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> Don't ruin it by going back.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> then you will be in control.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_40> no, you must settle...but not always for less.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> post naked pics on a 360 page.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> but if you dont think you can wait cut her lose.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> So what is she *hurt* over?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Now, this guy told her he couldn't go around wid her.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> be mature dont be scared and go for goal!
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_30> be yourself and they will come
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> First you look around to see what type of guys your interested in.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Should I Just try to be friends for now?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> let da situation take its course ba...
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> Hook her up with one of your guy friends she does not know.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> Don't worry about his issues, don't have sex with him and go out with other friends.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> just be yourself and don't sweat it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Dont worry, things will get better.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> so guys look for in a girl and girls also to guys.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> I worked on my own issues first.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> I WOULD GIVE HIM THE WORLD IF I COULD!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> But girl, you should move on.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> But you don't need a mate.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Guys like confidence, not girls who don't think for themselves.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> yes we are all different and unique so why talk about it unless it is a big issue.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Take a deep breath and introduce yourself or just say hi!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> A hot girl or at least take homeable....
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Otherwise have her use a friends phone.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> DON'T HOLD YOUR LIFE BACK WAITING ON HIM TO GET BETTER.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> And guys will follow you arround.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> She can't find a nice man for herself?
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> You know mom to son, dad to daughter.

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> look, life is too short to wait him until he decide to come to u!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> typically, your momma knows what she's talking about.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> everything depends on you honey and whats inside youre mind and how you deal with this.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> for you even to think on it,makes you pathetic,you said it your self,move along girlfriend.

<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> about 15 years before men do

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> I want a girlfriend and i am not scared of that, but u see, wanting isn't everything.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> i can't feed him all time.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> You don't believe you deserve better, but you do!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> so in the end i got the raw end of the rope.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Prefer if Men answer - truthfully!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> And I doubt that anyone else in here have either...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Ya can't mix and match them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> do you miss him when hes gone.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> but eventually you should move on.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> The question here, is not if you love your man.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Give it some time... they ussually start to come around once they get used to u being around.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> I can forgive all his things coz I can't forget him ... ...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> Hey hun, Be careful with other peoples hearts.

<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> try joining a drag queen show lots of them not gay just like entertaining
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> or not having it at all!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> You could ask him if he woud consider going out on a real date with you...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Don't try changing for some guy.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> You can't let a guy use you like that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> asxk the woman to be your freind don't ask her out that is just sick
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Good Luck, I hope it's been everything you hoped for!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Absolutely not... would you want someone that you loved to dump you just because of your hight or age?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> Do you mean S & M?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Ok...here's the whole picture in short.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> IF YOU HAVE MONEY I WILL BE YOUR FRIEND.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_25> i dated 2 women once, for a year, i wouldn't do that again.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> it wont and dont work like that.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_30> Girls who are hot and know it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> Don't let your hotness heat up your brain and attitude.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> am i too young to be getting married?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> no beacuz i did that and its better to say it now than say it later then regret it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Wow, it sounds like she doesn't have too much trust.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> If you didn't mean to full in love with him then y r u looking for his attention.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> If you are lucky, you will only get married once!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> It kinda makes the kids realize how maybe their own parents aren't that bad.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> act like your interested in what shes talking about.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> is she nice and like to have fun.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> it's kind of happening right now....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> you shouldn't be asking this question to a bunch of strangers.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> It takes lots and lots of time.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> Is he so lazy that he cannot pick up the phone.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> They shouldn't be taken lightyly (NO EXCUSES!)
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> if you choose to go, don't go alone you have to be very carefull these days....good luck
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> if you love him so much, talk to him instead of asking the internet.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> just get a life... you can at least give away something that LOOKS legit...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> :-)  I think it's just how sex in marriage is supposed to be.
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_30> heres a crazy idea try YAHOO
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> just call her and see what is going all.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> get a guy friend 2 ask him and if he does go out with him
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> i have been divorced for 8 years now.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> It just takes time before u realise u have found true love.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> honestly what you should do is exactly what you did.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> when you are not doing your job and just sitting around thinkning of girls....
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> and do wut you think is right
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> If u wanna discuss it more deep then chat with me on yahoo pickut2001@yahoo.com  seeya'roun;-D
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Jus be yourself and ur ok u'll get attention out of that
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> i think we all have our perfect someone out there.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> love is the most amazing thing you will never see, only feel...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> HOW OLD ARE YOU?, I CAN GIVE YOU AN IDEA, BUT I MUST KNOW YOUR AGE.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> He's always angry and yelling at me...so, I want to get as far away from him as possible.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> If that doesn't work try to inore her but most of the time that doesn't work.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> I don't know what to do...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> I met a married guy and then I met his wife and daughter.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> Don't chase him, make him chase you.....
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> her real father dont come around, ownly when he want 2 and he dont do anything for her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> 4RM MY POINT OF VIEW NOTHIN IS WRONG W/ BEIN GAY/LESBIAN.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> that depends on u  was the sex good and r u now currently with someone else
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> Nope, you won't buy also a car, you didn't drive before !

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> Tell your freind to get lost!!!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> Then the date of marriage don't worry.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Oh come on, Mrs. Howell is where it's at!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> tell him 2 leave u alone!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Don't hide the woman you love.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> if you accually look like the avitar no.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> I know I would have to be in love with a girl for that.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> Do have sex with her asap.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> verry normal verry girls like gurly girl are like that so you are normal (d)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_10> FRIEND OR NOT, THEY WILL BETRAY YOU AT SOME POINT.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> get creative with out hurting her feeings...and never tell her what your getting!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> But if u really like this then i think that u should ask him out.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> haha i like these other answers!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> Like I said, get over it and just move on.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> I dont know what ur saying
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> im not selling myself on here but i was just curious about this question.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> my kids are just like any other kids out there.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Why, cuz it was a quick and easy answer and I didn't have to think.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_20> Yea it's hard I KNOW BELIEVE ME.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> girls of course girls are the first people to find a guy they like
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> see if they will befriend u and help u learn nu things.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> If my wife is even slightly jealous of a female, I love it.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> If you know he likes sports, talk about that.. if you know he likes music, talk about that...etc.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> go to the supermarket and see what items a guy has in his cart.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> if you look like your avatar,yes(I'm 14)
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_10> WELL WHAT I THINK U SHOULD DO IS JUST LEAVE HER ALONE ALL THE WAY.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> a special meeting wth a friend hoping to get married in future
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> YOU NOR YOUR KIDS NEED THAT CRAP IN YA'LL'S LIFE.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> i'm not married yet but i do think that handling one wife would be tough enough already...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Or if you just don't like her anymore, then you should feel no remorse for dumping her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Get that list of things that would make him happy and do them.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> yes,, he just wants to getinto your panties
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Get to know the person and NEVER hurry!
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> what do u do when u like 2 guys?
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> LOL.....sounds like hubby better wake up.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> What happens should you & he break up?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> you can still be friends, but don't push it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> i dont think that it would be completely right but that is me.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> My face, I can seduce a man with my charm : )
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> Some people do cheat again and some people really don't.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> this is your life and your body take control and do what you want not someone else.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> if u like that much ask her out
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> Do you know what you're worth to YOURSELF???
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> but be nice while saying it.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> i say it's wrong when girls just expect gifts and don't wanna give..  thats just a real bitch.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i think u can find them everywhere.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> do you actually hate him or was it just at that moment?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> TRUST SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN THERE, IT'S NOT WORTH IT!!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> because they get jelous when we have male friends,
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> You won't know unless you do and if they don't then you deciede to move on or not.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> With some men you can't make them wait for too long once their ready.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> never rush into it, its a cause for disaster
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> hey really think like at 15 or 16  because there teens
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> well an age would be better.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_40> ask yourself and talk to her nicely, why?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> Well if its been a year and you are still not happy, then yeah its time to say goodbye.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> I don't see anything wrong with Will.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> * If you can not stop talking about her/him to your best friend
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> well i dont like the phone to much cant gauge how you are responding to me.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> My wife sure wouldn't let me go alone!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> i love him and he says (and i know he does) he still loves me.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> try and stay calm and not get irritated they will give up
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> even worse is the fact that he thinks its okay to do that...man u really should get someone else
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> yes , you'll see one day when you find the perfect persone
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> We tried telling her to stop, and she gets the point, but she just won' stop!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> It's gotta be Ginger, She's hotter and has a better name.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> well i hate to say this, but sounds like he has moved on.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> And the the same letters show up on my Yahoo mail a month later?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> U dont find true love in 2 days or even 2 years.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> Maybe offer up some cash too.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> lived in bedroom most my life best friend being a mirror and music.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> it depends on how he reated when he found out u liked him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> he is either a mama's boy .
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Maybe I would have waited then I would not have gotten divorced.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> thier is a secret on that...........try me and you will know
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Meet her in public not at her place or yours.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> who cares what the family thinks he needs to love you not them!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> But I never asked him if he loves me now.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> When you're in love, you just know!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Try to recognise that u r in luv or u just wanna br friends.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> did he ask you this in the heat of the moment?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> if not than you should find someone who does.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> If your not then you should move on.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> either way he is definitely a idiot .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> or do you mean you like girl things and act like a girl?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> have  to check local law books  american indaian no
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> if your brother is younger that could bethe deal.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Not anymore :)  I'd say TALK.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> In my family we only exchange gifts with kids!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> If you even have to question in...get rid of him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> IF you truely love eachother yes wait.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Just go out and start meeting guys, there's bound to be nice guys out there.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> but my advice is to go ahead and live with someone before marrying them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> They don't get to see thire daddy anymore.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> its early if u get it from ur bf.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Go and do something fun with her.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> maybe you need a hug and some guidance
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> marige is the leading cause of divorce
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> Only problem is once they get a guy the don't know what to do with him!
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_30> no dont do that take it slow it is a life time commetment
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> iam from egypt plesse icanot find any frinds can you be my frind
<NbChars_310> <LevSim_25> You gotta make her want you.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> That is just they way they are.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> just say hi..or send a sms.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> i luv steelers and i would wear normal clothes like sweat shirts and jeans
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> as much as you can handle have your cake and eat to enjoy!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> what happens if it's just for a one night hook up, the lean, built guy will win that one.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> I love a guy who makes me laugh alot.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> Just try and make it happen!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> Obviously this girl is not that into you and likes the other guy more.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> most do not and they do not even know it themselves that they all lie most of the time
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> Maybe time will just tell why...
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_20> get in the habit of doing something else... a playful dirty look, maybe.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Finally I asked him if he still loves his ex (married with kid) and he said...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> wll as for me it seems that you dont trust your girl..hey!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> you don't want him knowing your street address just yet.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> don't let me get you down.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> looks, character, way of talking, style.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Thats how big girls look to me and most men that don't like them.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Like maybe no one understands what's it's like for you?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> It's a big world out there and it's waiting for you to jump back in better than ever before!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> wanting to get revenge IS pathetic honey...move on...
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> Ouch, that right there spells trouble to begin with.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> Why, do her letters show up on my company e-mail every day.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> If you're good enough to live with!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> or go to a strip club and just have fun !!!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> Tell him exclusives like, (example) I would LOVE you to hit it from the back & spank me!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> no it is not to young for a kiss!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> Have you tried phone sex with your girlfriend?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> friends mean well,thats all i can say...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> YOUR DOOMED, TELL YOUR MAMA TO COOK SOMETHING AND LET YOU HAVE IT.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> because then you should talk to someone you trust and respect.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Then once he tells me that I would be like Well, would you ever see me and you together?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> Hey, I'm in the same boat as you!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> you guys need to communicate before you go and file papaers.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> ask someone thats coool with him to ask him 4 ya
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> And as far as I know, you only got one chance at it to make it work.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> and this is important to me because?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> so we just need a break.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> do you mean morally or if they do this?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> will your mom get over it?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> While at work, I keep my mind on my work.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Actually, I think it's men who generally go by looks.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> I have no real preference on body type, i mean i like my girls decent, im human.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Aquarious, I looked it up for you
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> know, so that i can find the guy and break his neck
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> Don't try to make friends.. Then you will have the best of them.. trust me ..
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> don't let him freakin move in with you!!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> It is about your heart(s) and not about the Stars at the skies !!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Look at all the child predators out there...and the undercover cops that try to bust them.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> can you get them in a retirement home?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> just be nice until things get better---u dont want to call it off too soon
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> I'm 55 and I still dream about a girl from high school.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_25> Just be a man, step up and ask!!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> First kiss is not as serious as virginity, but it's worth finding the right guy to give it to.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> But I know how hard it can be.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> as long as you like the person.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> Are guys self-concious about this too?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> it cld just b a friend of his.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Embrace your new found freedom-you don't need that dump truck of crap!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> of course it is just hope that they feal the same about you
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> then ud know how real tough feels like and your life will become better and without any probs !
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> i almost lost my friend over a guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> the feeling of care which we have for parents, bros.; sisters and for friends....
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_35> live life.if he didn't like you so what.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> its the person who makes it last.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> you have sy....do you would want to take a coffe ?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> if u don't believe it can last then it won't.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Just buy her something and see if u are shivering.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> I've already read the book He's Just Not That Into You.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> i will not give my life story and my situation is not exactly the same.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> no i dont think it is i think it is for both of them
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Don't worry IT IS NOT YOU!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Pls ppl...let me know what should i do to get my husband like bf.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> thats a hard one to answer because the interenet is so inpersonable.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> my friend  is always annoying when she doesn't try to.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> PLZ HELP ME OUT...... What should I do now?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> depends if you are male or female.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> You don't want a guy that likes the fake you anyways.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> But everytime I wanna end it, he doesn't want to.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> And just WHAT the HELL are you asking?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Always with the good ole country girl.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> sorry... do not have good fun over the internet.....
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> (insecure)  said of a person or their disposition: lacking confidence;
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> That's the way I see my wife.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> i guess you could say he is interested in you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> To be honest none of them !!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Everybody wants to be loved really bad.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I dont think it is too young to have a kiss on the cheak.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> If you love your current boyfriend that much then you already know the answer
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> has  he got a computer and no so computer savy?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> tell him you love him and then maybe he will love you
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> i never be one, but i think it should be really good hearing yourself and him saying the vows.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> Do what ever u want it's your life and I think it is perfect.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> so good luck getting the answer to that one.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> READ THAT BOOK and DO NOT call him.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> because if he is it can be weird because you're in different stages of your life.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Believe me, HE WILL NOTICE THAT!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Give him time to figure it out but don't wait forever, give him a time limit!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> as in you wish you were a girl?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Answering you & watching an old rerun of Jaws2!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> tell him I dont love you but do it in  a nice way.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> I admit, there I times I wonder what if?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Try to back off a little.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> my friend is inlove with his friend, well they're both guys.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> i'm a girl and as for me that's sweetiest thing a guy would do ...   :)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> If it's single serve stuff, your in.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Am i in love with her/him?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> TAKE THE 1ST STEP TELL THE PERSON THAT YOU LIKE THEM.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> terrible excuse; leave him out to dry
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> I can't seem to let her go...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> What I would If I were in that situation would be to spice things up a bit.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> but maybe u shld dig a little deeper into the case.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> One day if she is walking walk with her and talk.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> is he worth fighting with your mom over?
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_40> because you look good but because you feel good.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> now if the guy doesn't want u to get him something still get something.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> call him  say I LOVE YOU.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> Let them come over and chill out with them!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> y mostly boys wants to chat with girls but girls i think they dont wanna chat with boys
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Most people don't have the maturity to pick someone out for life at a young age.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_20> absolutly nothing ,love knows no race-religon-or gender.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> however, just call her up and tell her the truth (gently though): that you want your things back.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> I am Bisexual and I just came out and people are treating me A LOT different.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> The friends are either not as mature, or jealose of his good looks, or both.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> yes i got like a billion chicks... ok only 3 this week, but next week a billion.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> yes just export or down load
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Or have a stripper do it for you....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> big boobs and a sarcastic attitude... it worked for me....
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> DUH j/k become friends with them and make them tell you what they like and then screw them
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> well pimpin aint easy gotta put them feelins aside and put that mac down
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> 2 of my exhubands were abusers.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> Most of those girl reckon married man have expirience, I think its crazy!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> If it's a friend who talks about sex and you sometimes like it then that's good.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> hahahahhaahhaahhahahaha : )   If it smell like fish-- RUN in the other direction:>
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> u need a chat room with females in it so u can talk to them there.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> but the money and the anger is why i am so close to leaving.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> Who cares if it doesn't work out you LIVED!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Number one: your too young to have a boyfriend.

<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> First of all, let me say i'm glad for you bro.

<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> no.. and if you think so you're a creap
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Start bragging about having casual sex, and you'll have even more...

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> he.s bored liven it up a lil use your imagination
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Leave her alone- if she loved you she wouldn't have put you in that situation!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> So it can work if you want it to!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> and she is part of a soap unless she catches him red handed....

<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> there will always be good humens with the bad ones
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> A lot more women then men go by heart then looks.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> well, you better look for a good personality and awesome looks!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> Sleping with a guy doesn't mean you love him.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> let him know how u feel.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> You don't want any mistakes later.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> some old guy in Texas who pretends to be nineteen or something?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> your just the girl he sleeps with?....No...you better show him how you feel.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> why do you want to know...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> if you really loved or like the person it shouldnt matter then race or color
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> You don't got no time to waste dude.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> you don't want to hurt his ego.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> And at 4 I can't say hey your daddy cheated and don't love mommy anymore.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> anyhow, i apologize for being wordy.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_35> she does not date people from work.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Diamond ring...oh yeah, got that this holiday :) Why do I prefer it?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> YES SOULD BE EVEN WORSE THOUGH.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> I just want someone to talk to!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> But if ur X really loved you then they wouldnt have done that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Right now, i still like him alot, and haven't gone out with anyone since the brake up.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_10> PEOPLE WHO KNOW BOTH OF YOU WILL EVENTUALLY TELL.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> write him a letter and then go on holiday alone,to give him time to think about it
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> first u just tell her that u r always with her.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> I said yes, he moved to where I live (a looooooong way) and we got married.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> if he doesn't want to talk then try a counseling.

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Number two: yout too young to have a boyfriend on the internet.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> To fight fairly, do the following:  1) Stick to the issue at hand.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> they are only for fooling around with!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> He looked sad, and walked away quietly...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> try to advice him  and stay beside him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> what two people feel is can not be bad.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> where are those girls, could some of those send me a message on my yahoo
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> why'd you give your stuff to her in the first place?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> write her a note with one small flower then she will know who and what your all about!!!!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Don't be afraid though, don't show doubt.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> once a cheater always a cheater.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> so if ya like girls go like girls its ur life ain't know one stopping ya.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> take him out and show him different places and new ppl !
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> just don't get too over anxious  and be Paitient..It will pay off.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> just start talking to her and get to know her more.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> im in wa if u want 2 find out
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> lazy inconsiderate husbands... :P  the considerate helpful grooms just stayed in the wedding pictures
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> when i read something instead of my reading i have my mind somewhere els.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_20> !I wanna see if he is THE BEST MATCH FOR UR BEAUTY N INTELLIGENCE!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Hope this can give the both of you alittle help.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Now can I ask you one back?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> Because you wouldn't like it if someone where doing that to you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> umm  who are you talking about?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> im wonderin if the only reason my bf stays with me is because im incredible in bed?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> I ASKED HIM ABOUT IT BUT HE SAID THAT HE DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING GOING ON WITH HER.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> man, you NEVER say that you're ugly.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> MEN OVER THAT AGE TEND TO SETTLE ON ONE WOMEN.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> TRY GOING WITH THE GUY THAT LIKES U & IF HE IS NOT THE ONE BREAK UP WITH HIM!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> No more stupid hiding, or getting mad at him because you want to play hard to get.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> you can't build a relationship if there is no trust.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> But you should take a break and go get your GED.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> I will ... even I know he is lying me or giving me a lot of pain ...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> JUST TELL HIM YOU LOVE HIM!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Yep,but they never work out for me.But I approve
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> is he way older than you?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> Men hunt and woman nest..........keep that in mind!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> when he tells u that he loves uy and he seems like he mines it
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> Dump him a cheatin friends not a good friend!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> then it dont so if you get it back then you had to get it off some one else
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> JUZ KEEP SAYIN HI WHEN U SEE HER.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> i dont see why people judge us..
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> I think some men are just not good at small talk.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> yes, wait for a few more years.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> you dont, let a boyfriend find you
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> first of all , dont confront this girl.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> GODS SPIRIT EMANATING OUT OF HER!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Get to know someone before you take them to your home....LOL
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> Does he think he's hot stuff and you gotta put out his fire?
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> Eww no EFFFEnse but it is GROSS
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> I just wanna know is it an attraction or more to it?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> carrying around your anger is such a burdon, and its really not worth it.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> But if you actually go out there and talk to your crush then it's not as important.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> Get a life, and look for another girl.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> Just let it go, and only talk about it if he wants to (and says so).
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> He tries to change, I can see that...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> Plan A: Try talking to him and your freind again if that doesn't work.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> / What is the real issue here?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> No why did you guys break up in the first place.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> u should find someone who speaks ur language and the language of the contry ur in.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> Did you break up or did he?
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_50> I say it never too soon to fall in love.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> only if its something you both want you have to both want it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> I need help befor I rely mess up!!
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_35> im a real playa but i dont wanna meet ya
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Why would you care if there IS any?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> The girls will teach u,I wouldn't wotty about it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> date of birth doesn't matter more like date with guy.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> if her accept your offert is a good way, if not...forget it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> first be friends, guys fall in love with the girls who are really good friends soo often :))

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> dont sweat it there is plenty of boys out there let your girl have him
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> The rest of her aint so bad either!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Did you ask him why he wanted you to hit him with a coat hanger??
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> I MEAN I CARE SO MUCH ABOUT THIS PERSON ITS CRAZY!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> not if it's lust, because sex with lust loses the must important element.........
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> its nice if u get it from ur parents.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> I agree with yall we have like 50 chicks for every guy
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> (People shouldn't knock it till they try it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> or that she has no f****ing idea what ur talking about.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> because they are idiots.. men were put on this earth to be stupid.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Tell her if she can't trust you then you don't need that in your life anyways.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> just tell him you have a bf just dont tell him who.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> If he is shy he might just be afraid to ask you out.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> But i'm not that lucky yet.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> I cheated aand she put me out.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> honestly, i'd just ask him face-to-face.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> It won't hurt unless you have an issue between you two... }
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> have a really nice car/ its an instant EYE CATCHER!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> I know ya'll had some yrs.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> there are some place like la try there if not then try a map lol
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> If you love her then it's right.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> just be yourself , and honest, respectfull, and u will have any friend ya want
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> he doesn't apologize to me about it, he's apologized to the other girl though.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Even if the wife was the one having the affair.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Why don't you try gettin' close to her a lil bit ?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Did one of her friends ask you?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> if not then continue to be eye candy for the ladies.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> its kind of hard because of the sterotype that surrounds musclebound men.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> GOOD LUCK AND PRAY FOR US THAT HAVENT FOUND OURS(PLZ)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> its never to soon to fall in love
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Don't think about how hot she is.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> Bottom line...suck it up and take what life throws at you.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> How can I get her in the mood??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> cuz I thought that was best for my child.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> if 3 days later he doesnt call U CALL him, probably had appointments or something.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> You should be pretty safe, but who would want to do it with you- BORING!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Wish you the best of luck, whatever you decide!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> It sucks when you aren't even friends.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> THAT IS A COOL POEM !!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> as a guy give him some space.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> ], i don't see a problem with divorce.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> oh telling the women you got two stores is that suppossed to get them interested in you?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> People will label you a slut.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> MARRIED AT 19 HERE AND THAT WAS TOO YOUNG.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> If all he's doing is chatting, then no biggie.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> THERE ARE BIRDS,ANIMALS,FLOWERS, MOST PEOPLE HAVENT SEEN.SUNSETS THAT WOULD TAKE YOUR BREATH AWAY.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> so i make it short and to the point.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> he was waiting to see if he was going to get something if he stayed married to her.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> IM SURE SOMEONE ELSE WILL ASK YOU IF NOT ASK SOMEONE ELSE.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> find someone to spend the rest of your life with
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> Well...what if he is just as lost as you?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> im tired of taking him back.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> Get out before it's too late.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> Loosen up and let him have it!!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_10> YOU DONT YOU JUST HAVE TO TRUST HER UNTIL YOU CATCH HER
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> Its just a gig so no.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> !i have a few friends--he's tall she's short..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> !beauty lies in the eyes of beholder
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> Also why is it that they are no longer married?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Just go up to her and be yourself.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> And penis is not the only way you can satisfy woman...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> yea i think its a day to show someone u love them anyone a friend a boyfriend girlfriend.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> try yahoo's personals site, it's free
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> i have a friend who has a boyf that is horrible to her, calls her stupid too and everything.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> She's a freshman-You're a junior, remember what it was like!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> If you can't trust your mate, it's just not worth it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Sorry I just dream about marrying my boyfriend a lot.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I hope someone answers this so i will know too.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> sounds like you love her very much!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> just ask... are you trying to be creative?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> other people come and go, but you are always with yourself.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> or desperate to get in your pants .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> Some guys actually like big eyes.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Keep your hands in your pocket !
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> Tell him your not ready and you don't know when your gonna be ready.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> i cant sleep when i close my ays so i just see her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> My wife is a good woman.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> I just don't, and apparently she don't either.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Ask' Do u care if I call u sometime?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> but dreams remind you that you do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> and if she ain't, you won't ever see your things again!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> try to impress her some how- do anything that sounds good.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> dump him u are not a trash can
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> my bro had the same prob.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> I'm chatting with a guy from another country the last few days and i do wonder ?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_15> WELLL IF YA LOVE HER THAT MUCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> What is SO wrong about it???
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> good insight on this kind of thing.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> If gays get married, it becomes same as normal marriage later.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> What if you never get married?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> sure if you want to lose your husband in future.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> jUST BE REAL WITH HIM AND HE'LL COME AROUND.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> and why would you want to make someone love you thats fake.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Just as if I asked you a question what is so wrong with being a Black?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> when i call him on it he denys it
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> Listen, my dear, it's all about doing you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> u r reciving this message so wat do u think ?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> there are so many ways to liven up things..do not just let it fall by the way side.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> My boyfriend and I just starting dating.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> do not do it keep it to email only fix what you have first
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> and if the girl is worth it she'll apreciate u and say yes!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> choose sweet but not cute because they respekt you
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> call her but if you think something is going on like she doesnt like you then dump her
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> u have to have a lot of luck with u and be there a good time.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> So my answer would be no.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Just tell her to stay out of thier way and have friends over more.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Size is a GOOD thing and you either have it or you don't.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> You are a good woman or you wouldn't be worried about your marriage.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> If your girlfriend is happy her mum will be happy.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> And now...oh my god my sms is being read by a crazy man as well LOL
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> break up with her and say i didnt want to do this im very very sorry
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> this may not have benn wat you wanted but i tried... love MS cowgirl....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> children) then what do you have to lose?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Good luck anyway whatever you decide to do!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> hang out with your girlfriends, go shopping, pursue a hobby, watch TV, whatever, spend some time alone, enjoy yourself.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> Men play at love to get sex, women play at sex to get love.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> who's always honest listens to your problems gets along great with you has your back
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Showing that picture of your good looking self is a good start!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> forgive them but dont forget their names...
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_20> find a kinky chick thats down
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> I mean, what if she wants to treat him like her REAL husband?!!
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> don't waste a friendship over a stupid (or great) guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> ya it is possible if u both love each other very much.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> u cant only the person if they honest will tell u
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> spare me...sounds like a load of bull.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> so sometimes guys will say that so the girl will have sex with him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> women do it all the time to men.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> nope nope nope they all dogs
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> (WELL THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS......)
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> there really is no answer to that question because it really depends on the girl.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> sometimes they have different looks on things, sometimes they think differently.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> im great actually 2day is my bday
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> is something that nowadays people  make a big deal out of it.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_15> TO ME IT SEEMS LIKE SHE WANTS HER CAKE AND EAT IT TO.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> every thing except doggy ...what's urs?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> WOw, I didn't know there were 7 seas!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> you are being played as a sucker.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> if he really loves you,he won't even think about it for one second.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> No sweetie, I'm not even considering it...  ;)
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> if he likes you a lot he will give everythign u want.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> i would (sell)it,and make a nice profit while i could
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> youre never too young if you love the person youre getting married to (or if hes rich) or both.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> well i hope this will help u.;)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> a nice smile and a good heart .... ooops thats 2
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> such detailed dream can get you pregenant.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Good Men != Good + Men.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> U seem to be a tranny.....
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> club cofee shop store u tell me
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Okay, you've fallen down, it's time to get back up.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> hi first loved you then suddeny got a new girlfriend.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_50> together, good or bad, but you deserve better.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Please do not listen to that stupid answer she just gave you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Just now I read some gay guy who wants a hummer.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> Good women always find good men... (I guess u got the answer ; )
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> women are jealous beings...esp when it comes to their bf having female friends
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> If she looks at u while u're not talking.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> If the two of you are into it, then yeah.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> ha ha u don't u have to catch her doing something wrong behind your back!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> Why would you want to be with a guy that doesnt love you---??
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> then after some time, see if he's ready
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> You will have to ask him that!!!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> i dont think we made it out of the parking lot that night... ;)
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> besides once someone does truly love you.. he will come back begging anyway.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> if he care he will try, i said TRY and do this
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> It could be lots of fun!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> $100 all day long any jeweler.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> if she threw you off, she obviously doesn't want a romantic relationship with you anymore.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> kiss another guy in front of him
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> If she glares at you...forget it!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> You're gonna do what you're gonna do anyways, right?
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_30> yes u should.coz fightin is not a good experience atleast for me.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> (put the gun on the table and talk to him)....or..fine..just talk to him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> So many are looking for something they can't have instead of keeping the person they are with.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> what a girl do for when she wants to kiss me too?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> maybe , who knows, only time will tell, wait and see
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> guess u r trying to keep up relations with one n many.....making others insecure!!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> My ex used to call me her Poet Lover.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Geeze, I hate it when really good looking people are so boring!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> groose  kidding i meant your question
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> So, if he can do it so can you!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> If she really cares for you, having a smaller penis will not matter.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> SHOULD I GO AHEAD AND CALL CHEATERS.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> Actually, I'm going to marry him.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> boys just look in for girls couse they like them or they just think they r hot
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> ya he is right and i don't want get arested + u r too young
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> yes it is colour shouldnt matter
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> pls help me...  PS:  give me geniune replies...this is very much serious to me.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> ok...First of all..stop with the suicidal shit..not gonna help you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> well i can't answer that because i have a friend i don't like either.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> SO TRY TO KEEP UR MIND OFF HER AND KEEP UR SPIRITS UP.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> As mentioned earlier lawsuits and begging work
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> But if you are gay and looking for a religion where that won't be sinning, there isn't one.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> So, how does she know that you like her?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> ?, sorry i dont know what that is
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> It feels like if my mom doesn't even like me.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> You are a fool for staying... not leaving.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Just imagine him being a father!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> thats why you keep thinking about her.you wnat her back to how things was when ya'll got married
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> CLICK THE HISTORY BUTTON NEXT TO THE BUTTON THAT SAYS MEDIA
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> people who are not kind and selfish are very ugly
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> You fill out your own LONG paperwork but it's cheap (like under $200.00).
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> leigh's  answer ..........  to the point......
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> if a man called me a freak i would take that as an insult.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> typing this...and eating my dinner...and you..
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> SHOULD I TELL HER WHAT I THINK OR MOVE ON.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> getting points for anwsering this and just hanging around my house before i go into work tonight
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> Funny, great conversationalist, big brown eyes, great looks.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> if he keeps on pushing about gettin' it on - you need to move on.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> take your parents with you, if you can.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> maby u 2 should go ur seperate ways for a while.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> Then she came back to me sayin that she didn't want that guy anyway.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> Guys shoudln't just be Oh what's the best way to get this hot girl in bed with me!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> are you having problems with your wife?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> But if you loved her youll never truely forget her an youll always love her.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> yes i am :)  ym me :)
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> us women think we are going to hurt their feelings.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> id love to.. hey im online on yahoo.. buz me at im_me_hotmale@yahoo.com   hope to talk to ya
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> You should try to hang out with him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> If she gets upset only after realizing she`s wrong, tell her to SUCK IT UP.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> But that is up to you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> I live with a bunch of racist rednecks but im not racist.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> or the person is just so dense.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> its happened before and will happen again!!!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> i would give him three strikes and he's outta there!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Find another one atleast for 5 years!!!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> yes i am... hit me up with info... me69dou2@yahoo.com
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> I just bought one last year
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> Try your local Biker Bar..If your Butt Ugly you should score around closing time.......
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> me me me me me me
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> The head nurse couldn't check him in.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> divorce is not a horrible thing.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> THE WORST THEY CAN SAY IS NO.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> Trial and error, don't come on too strong, and have fun!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> If he or she truely care about u there's no reason why he or she  should cheat.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> ask the married men some times the girls dont know
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> E-mail me so we can talk about this: wilsonfreetorhyme@yahoo.com
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> And you have the 411 so why not.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> .. behave yourself and come on .. how can u even think abt it!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Sorry, but Mom is ALWAYS right...and it REALLY sucks to hear I told you so
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> Be gentle but confident and do not look scared!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> She already has one child and her mother takes care of it.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_15> Best bet:  KEEP YOUR PANTS ON UNTIL YOU GET MARRIED
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> I don't like big girls because they don't look good to the eye.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Then in december she broke up wid me cuz she started likin another guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> She really will if you do that ok?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> You see where I'm going here?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> She will think you are a stalker.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> say im not ready to make a huge commitment yet being friends is best for me right now.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> yeah there really is something wrong.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> leave him because he is not worth it but cause you can do better
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> do you always show what you have.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> The only good men around r the men us women wouldnt want, like the less attractive, mor geeky ones.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> I am not looking for a BF
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> you need to weight out your options.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> If you don't like that lose weight.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> in my opinion guys only like foreign girls because they think that they are more sexy
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> he wants you for sex and you know it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> they're all happy dreams & they're all different.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> don try to show them off too much..
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> There are men out there who are willing to love and BE loved (I am one of them!)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> 4.  ooo ear lobe sucking.. every guys has his different spot, but you get the idea.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> Ok I have been dating this girl for almost a year that I met in yahoo chat .
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> yes because your great-grand mother and his great grand mother would be sisters.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> if they have their mouth open and they're male
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> so if you stay with him then you realize that what he wants and nothing more.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> BUT FOR NOW GO ON WITH YOUR LIFE.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> aww thats so sad well needless to say she was a bitch!
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> how can i convince him i didn't mean it?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_70> give her red rose and kiss
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Do you know what a womans 5 basic needs are?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Because I really care what they think.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> If not, he's not worth your time!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_65> i call my fiance Bubba and Baby.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> but listen don't let other ppl juge and role your life.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Furthermore guys need friends just like girls need their friends.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> Let him have a little bit, offer him a snack you know?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> She has started TALKIN' to that guy.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> Anyway, You should do what ever makes you happy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> Clearly he is not just friends with you - he is still hung up on you.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_10> THERE ISNT A PLACE LIKE THAT NO WHERE...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> let her do what she wants.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> (some of these cost as little as $20).
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_10> YES EVERY SITUATION IS DIFFERENT BUT YOU HAVEN'T GROWN UP YET, SO TO SPEAK.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> I'm sure it's was she's waiting for.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> i just watched weekend at bernies, and now im answering yur question... wutr u doing?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Ask her out and if she says Yes, that's mean she likes u.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> whats it mean and what should i do now?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> I'm a good man, just not latino.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> If you are the bride, its really up to you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> U always need somebody like that so u'll never feel u're not worthy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> it is not weird at all, my husband loves my toes!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> I really do not know what to do.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> pls don´t try, get out of mine, its better that u buy a dog.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> do you realize what this means?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> um skool bumping into each other acciedently
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> thats just nasty i would never have a stanger in my house
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> Uh huh, you wan't someone to pay your way...right.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> size does matter and movements matter
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Well if you guys are close you should tell her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Tell her what she wnats to hear.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> I could please my man lol!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> as long as the person makes u happy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> But a kiss on the lips, 7th grade is a little too young for that.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> if you love her, yes, go for it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> I love her very much and I would do ANYthing for her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> I preffer all of thee above :P
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> or does it matter..keep in mind i would be a very good catch and a great hubby
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> i'd be freaked out if you were my bf.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> and my boyfriend doesnt know either lol.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> ok oohing and aahing aside were you wet down there  does she eat pea-nuts during sex?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> my favorite color brown and blue
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> in making friends, first thing i know is to be nice.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Ask im, if e realy likes u e wouldn't wanna ly.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> omg....... i never do it so i don't know.. lol bit i guss it's reallie sweet..
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> how would you feel if he did that to you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> please dont say just ask that would be to akward.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> If you really have to ask that, then i think you already know the answer
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> So don't let things get really bad.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> that does happen in many cases.many often they make ideal couples too.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> go on to a female chat room
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Guys can be a little NOT showy sometimes which is a male thing ;) Hope this helps.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> go for fantasy, live life with no regrets
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> First night, first night of what?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> EVEN IF IT IS WINTER AND FREEZING COLD.IT WILL BE THE MOST NERVOUS, SWEATY,PERSPIRATION FILLED DAY OF YOUR LIFE.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> That you don't to share her with anyone eles.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> all shades of blue and pink
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> of course there is, just how to do it?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> not making yourself stick out like a sour thumb.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> that is a disgrace to mankind, so don't even think about it!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> just tell him what you really feel for him, maybe she also into you!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> What if money came up missing?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> so i told him str8 up 4 him not 2 say that unless he ment it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> if he's not calling anymore & things like that.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> everyone gets married on the right time in there relationship.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> But some people think it's for a guy to shower the girl w. love and gifts.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> 4) Finally I asked him if he still loves his ex (married with kid) and he said...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> But hes still da same:( I just can't leave.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> should i say yes or no or what?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Although my type is a white guy but im not predjudice.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Dump him, and go do things that make you happy with other people who make you happy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> You sound like you're a kid.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> whatever you do DONT use a lame pick-up line!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> if you don't like to date drunk guys, dump him for whatever reason
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> so instead we stay in relationships we do not want.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> and no animal sex is not appropriate either the same rules apply .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> * Love happens when your not looking.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Girls don't like shy or weak guys!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> Have the other girl tell her.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> Might take some time, but it'll be worth it in the long run, if that's what your up for!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Guys are pretty much going to do what ever you'll let them.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> try to go out with him and see what happens.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> if there pupils are dialated then you know.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> we are all hot in our own way.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> At least you won't spend the rest of your life wondering about what could of been..
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Three Fwd Wishes: Grace => Mercy => Peace.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> Take that break and don't let him in your bed!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> so don't do it to yourself.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> If you think that two women being together is sick, then why ever answer the question????
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> i dont think it matters if your white, black, purple, yellow, etc.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> I ask her nicely please don't do this.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> but i told him that i dont know any thing about this but wants answer from me.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> well because he felt like it ur mom hates girls luvyo bro sry

<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Do you hang mostly with him?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> Most girls like the mature guys.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> have you thought about what you could win?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> YOU JUST NEED TO STOP LOOKING AND SOON THEY WILL FIND YOU.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> Send Her flowers and chocolate MORON girls like that I should know

<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> or, get someone to do it for you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Mary Ann...I like brunettes better than redheads
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> No......no girl would want to go home with a stupid idiot like you.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> i dont exactly know where we stand in a relationship.... ANY TIPS??????????
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_5> JUST BE CAREFUL CUZ WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> He sounds like a pretty decent guy but just not the guy for you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Find her & talk to her!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> If he is a nice guy then you should totally keep him!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> i have some stupid popup that won't go down and i can't turn off the speakers....elevator music, nooooooooo!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> But my boyfriend is my best friend but dont ruin your relationship ok..
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Now his ex wife maybe coming back to him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> You do not want children with problems, do you?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> go right ahead if you like them and they like you back.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> I say, just go over and start talking!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> yes you are supposed to please a woman.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> but ask yourself are you mentally and physically ready?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> i just wish for u that U get a Real n loyal friend.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> yes he's just not ready to tell you yet
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> don't concentrate on hatred, it will consume you to death!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> remember, in the end, its just you.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> im 15 m and nice to talk to as a cool friend
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> where can i find a great guide to lesbian sex positions??
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> oh love that doesnt sound good :( im sorry to say but i dont think he is worth it.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> entertain her with some small talents.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If you're not happy then why should u stay with him?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> go g!ve he@d to a female fish and then you can tell us all what it smells like
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> The kids stilll need their dad but you do not need a looser for a husband.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> this is such a crazy question that people think needs to be answered.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> you just like that certain type.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> This kind of thing makes me mad!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> Yes, though it depends where you go.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> (secretly) and i've found no colficts with culture and otherwise.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> and on v-day give her roses and ask her out.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> it depends from whom u get kiss.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> as for you- find something interesting to do for that time.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> just be your self most of the time that works good luck :p
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> First thing is, me and my ex have split up and got back together alot.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Just ask her if she has a bf.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Being a girl i suggest gift her a set of ring, necklace and earing is best....enjoy
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> i did, and it worked out nicely
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> are you mental... of corse its wrong!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> but tell her what you want its the way you say it nad mean it is what it conts
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> PPL JUZ THINK ITS WEIRD GOIN OUT W/ THE SAME SEX U R.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> and think that if you do not have it something is worng.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> stop being so shallow about a hot one.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> i'm ready to give in or give up.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> 3 months, at that age it took about 3 days for me!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> Wondering how stupid one must be to use 'u' instead of 'you'.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> break up with her she will be more sad if you don't don't make her the bystanderd
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> Kids are going to be a problem.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> I was going to say yo momma.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> if you want someone to talk to practicallie_sane@yahoo.com is my e-mail
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> I loved a guy for 4 years, and he loved me, too... or so I thought...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> tell her how hurtful they can be
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> Figure out what you did wrong!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> as many times as their schedule allows
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> by the way dont listing to the dude with spell check because his a churk.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> He cn/cnt be lyn- people usually don ly abou these stuf.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> he doesn't love you boo......why waste your treasure on him?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> I persue guys kinda agressivly, it works for me.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> imagine if they both divorce u and each one takes half of everything, u'll be left with nothing.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> alot of guys cant handel me.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> I don't know what to talk about.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> You know, it's just creepy that your looking for a girlfriend in a chat room..what are you?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> yea,they married the all sweet girls lol!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> anyone who says so is called a racist.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> becasue we are obviously not allowed male friends with you guys getting jealous.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_55> so your not alone and so you feel loved.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> What are you interested in.... girls?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> And make sure ask her out!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> if you oppose it maybe you should stay in your own affairs.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_25> go to a bar and PARTY !!!!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> Best of luck to you in life, love, and happiness.
<NbChars_345> <LevSim_25> i could be a friend too.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> Let me know if ur out there.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> Feel like you couldn't have more bad luck if you offered to buy it?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Hang out with friends keep yourself busy.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> Try to think of the kinda stuff he likes and work with that...ex.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Do you like long walk on the beach too
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> You dont want to wake up one morning and think Oh my god what have I done????!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Do not look too hard though, you may never find him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> It seems easy but it ain't jess n dave
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> i need a dish that looks, smells and tastes great, but is foolproof, cause i am a fool.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> I think it might mean if you ever wanted to be friends with benefits he is willing so call.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> someday he'll come 2 u.  theres a person 4 every person out there.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> if she really cares about you she'll come back.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> or even on the subway or in a store.
<NbChars_255> <LevSim_35> Let it go and move on!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> someone who is my age i mean like 13-14.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> a guy is just a guy.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> INFACT IT HAS BEEN PROVEN THAT MORE MARRIED WOMEN CHEAT THAN MEN.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> u r any one else shouldnt want 2 be labeled as a freak.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> You can't take back words - you said it, he believed it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> (Notice I mentioned nothing about looks, job, or money.....none of that really matters to a truely sincere woman!)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Don't be a fool and fall for the same line alot of girl do.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Hell dump you right after sleping together.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> but like i said you need to sit him down and talk to him about it
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> If he acts suspicous then leave it at that for then and do some detective work.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> but men and women define their need for space differently.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> Just like the stuff at the store that is half price, why is it so cheap?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> Whe you are in it, you know!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> Try watching Bueaty and the Geek, u'll c wat I mean
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I didnt think I was doing anything wrong!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> if they call you beautiful not hot.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> tell her that you can satisfy the needs of both of them.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> you are going to regret it i promise you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> pshhh.. im jus as stunned as you are..
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> If you are not religios, and she is OK with that, then it should not be a problem.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> are you going to be going around the whole world collecting your stuff back?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> B/c I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_20> my reply to that is : I WILL IF U FIND LOVE IN ME..:)  READ THIS.....................:)
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> Dump his butt, have some self respect.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Sooner or later she'll realize what a nice person you are!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> I mean did she break up with you because she thought you called her ?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> every time i fall in love here it hurts!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> Tell her she'll let you know!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> just go up their and said will you go out with me and ask her for her number
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> i'm very desperate to know my answer!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> hot chicks don't get to talk to a lot of great guys becuase everyone is intimidated of them.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> meaning for meaning is to mean that it doesnot have a meaning  lol
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> We are double dating w/ my sister and her boyfriend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> sometimes good enough is just that
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> 2's company, 3's a crowd, 4's too many, 5's not allowed.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> AT THIS POINT IN MY LIFE AM READY TO GIVE UP.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> from your situation.. dump him.. you said that its stale already.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> i love him and i fell wonderful with him
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Sure, just load it in the picture area.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> keep a distance with ur friend...since u already know it
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Hook him up with a F**king f a g
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> u can't make someone love u even if u try.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> because they take their life and love lightly.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> I do what ever i an to look really hot around him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Do you really want a girl whose mother is gonna control her life?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Just be nice & polite & be yourself....If thats not enough you can always ask !!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Now I have fun and enjoy my life I'm the one that is important.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Tell him that's not ur style.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> If you still have feelings for this guy that does complicate things.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I don't see anything wrong with that!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> I was not able to just forgive & forget!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> i think you're totally right about this not being a place for gay bashing.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> like prett farve, hes was really good but now hes not so good.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> yep love is just one of those annoyin litle things in life that you have absouletly no control of.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> If you play hard, you'll get the GRAND PRIZE ;)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> i was 15 when i first met him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> i dont remember any who didnt.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> it might be wrong for the involved person, but not u.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> im not sure, but im in 8th, and 13, and still never did, and im PROUD of it!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> after all, she's your best friend so its perfectly understandable that you like her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> If they become obstreperous, I have one of my minions trounce them.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> (for e.g ask him to call you whenever he feels ok).
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> By the way we are both females and not gay :-)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> Not any god I wanna know.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> trust me, im 19 and they're still like that at that age
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> I can not tell you how shallow that is!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> And for what, to appease some god?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> If she wants it give her another chance.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> AS LONG AS YOUR HEART IS AS BIG AS YOU THATS, ALL THAT MATTERS.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> yes there is nothing wrong with it to me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> why do u called it love when both of you cheated and lie to each other????????
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> If you do it real well, he might graduate you to baseball bat...now that's where the real fun starts!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> And I could not be happier w/ ANYONE else.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> I can tell you this, most guys i met don't care so they do it any ways.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> .........so i quit talkin to her, in search of a smarter woman.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> But don't go around kissing everyone!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> depends if he was my size and I liked the choices of clothing he wore....!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> lol but u should just make sure your there for him !
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Yes, he likes you, he is just shy.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> Al Greene, Luther Vandross, whatever you like, just don't have it so loud that you can't talk.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Don't wait until after Valentine's Day!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> so ignore him, and dont show him any kind of interest!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> yes, but thats not the way to bet.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> if the guy doesnt like you for who you are then he is not worth it!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> I don't see what the problem is.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> just come out and tell her that you want her to be you gurl!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> But make sure nothing comes out of it, unles of corse you're married...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> i like this guy but i hate askin guys out but do think i should ask him out
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> For awhile, but then they are always looking if there is nothing else to back up the relationship
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> pick up your bible and read it and you'll know what love is.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Do try to watch the kind of foods she packs in her cart though!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT MY MOMS DECISION!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_10> HERE U GO CHECK DIS OUT!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> and besides whatever makes the two of you happy is what counts.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> By the way how old are you???
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> depends on the man.... drop me a response.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> I know it's hard, but try and pity them.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> If she's made it clear to you that it's over move on.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> Well, first look for a girl that likes you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> I know it is hard but you should definately NOT call him.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> First off... why doesn't your family approve?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> If not then I just defiled my hairbrush for no reason ;)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i know how hard it is.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> i'm 18 and cannot wait to get marry.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> yes you are way too young to be thinking about marriage
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> the easiest way would be yahoo messenger
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> i am an 18 year old christian male that is to put it frankly horny.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> If that's the case then don't worry about what they think.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> after the squealing ask them to be in your wedding.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> So y not in love ????
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> But,(there's always a but), you also have to think about what would make BOTH of you happy.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> but cant find anything about it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> wait a bit- dont be so eager
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> If she wants it and you take it easy, she will want you even more!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> if he'solder that could also be it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Just remember, be a gentleman and don't kiss her on the first date.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> if u can't get things together then u don't like each other and u are not ment to be.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_20> (Or Husband Swap if that ever comes about - it is only fair!)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> Keep yourself busy...VERY BUSY so that you can't think about it.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> well you answer your own guestion stupid there it is
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> have a real serious talk with him.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_25> Be the bigger man (you know what i mean)!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> I got married 2 months back...I had a boy friend and had physical relations.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> can you be trusted do u like to laugh need more info
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_25> To catch guys, guys want a chase, not easy.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> I was 15, she was 21.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> if he's smiling and looking at you then sure, he likes you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> thats why everyone knows except the wife.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> It is wrong for gays to get married!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> if God didn't want homosexuals then he wouldn't have put that on earth.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> He's a really nice guy... loved by everyone, a crowd darling I may say.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Are you playing with your dad's computer?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Now here is a heads up for how guys think.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> nearly 11 ,or 12 they mature
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> man i DID pick the wrong day to stop sniffing glue
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> i feel it is ok coz we are free people,and can do so.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> if u nt satisfy plz email me at fastfellow2000 id in yahoo.i hope u will satisfy.thanks
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> if you love this guy and he loves you then go for it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> As long as i already knew the girl and we had some chemistry
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> sure its been done plenty of times.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> He said my voice is sexy too, esp.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> tust me you'll know when u meet the right one.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> there really SHOULDNT BE any guys who fit your description!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> i will be pretty weird don't  and don't make from your self the first talk of the ppl
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Throw a big party and then tell them about it and then they'll b like omg i lve u
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> i say you will know when its time!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> be honest and true to your self
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> But maybe he just wants to spice up your sex life?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> If you do not take charge fo your life, who would??
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> dbl wahmy..as a female would that be something that would turn u off?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> AND IF YOU SHARE IT WITH SOMEONE,IT WILL ADD A LITTLE MORE  GOOD TO YOUR WORLD.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> Just make sure you dont mess up or lie...
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> Black ps I am not african american
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> Maybe she also loves HERSELF and HER LIFE!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> but hey im only one person.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> Don't make it too big or expensive.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Kinda, but I knew someone who got married at 18.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Yep, having sex with your self!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> make sure she is a lesbian too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> can you tie your shoes now?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Well it sounds to me like you haven't found real love at home or abroad.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> in this case, either he plain lied or he has issues (abusive issues or just bad personality)
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> i wouldnt want a guy to like me for my body parts!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> I care about him but I'm not sure if I want to end up marrying him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> TAKE A BIG DEEP BREATH N SAY HI START A CONVERSATION 2 SEE WAT U GUYS HAVE IN COMMON.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> she is coming back in 5 years.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> I kissed a guy on the check in 2nd grade!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Works like the rabbit but way cheaper.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> flirt first see if she responds well to that and then ask her
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Pitts...why do you care what others think?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Unless you're fat and ugly, say hi to 'em.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> ;)   But Rascal's right - if one has love in mind and the other lust, it won't work.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> you'll never know until you lose it!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> He already went out with this other chick after me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> just stuff that they know that means thnx 4 being my bridesmate i hope i helped ya a little
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> I always believe that guys asks girls out.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> If she's rude.....chances are she's not worth pursuing.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> We're good friends too (have recieved many hugs!).
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> Cheating: There are people who are capable of it, and there are people who aren't.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> u guys broke up... that means that u dont love each other.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> you don't give ring unless you are married already or you want to be.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> e: A very sweet guy who needs to move on.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> I wonder if anyone else really wants to be happy...
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> I need more info about u.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> first of all how do you dress.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> the ugliest woman is a man because he's no woman
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> If you really are that bad of a cook.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> just go talk to the girl, be friendly and give ur relationship some time.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> Do the things you couldn't do because the ex didn't want to do them.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> but if you'd like, you can work at a tobacco farm or work in the summer time.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> depends whenever u no ur both ready and no yall want to spend the rest of ur life together
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> I tried to leave him so many times but im the one who always look like the fool.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I don't know what to do.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> if u have them on the ropes,whipped or sprung yes otherwise no.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> MAYBE WE GIRLS DONT BELIEVE U TO THAT EXTENT....WELL U CANT BLAME US 4 THAT.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Look at all the pretty grrrs here!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> He didn't like the break up...
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> is 7th grade to young to have your first kiss?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> I HAVE WAITED FOR A LONG TIME TO FULL IN LOVE WITH THAT SPECIAL SOMEONE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> typing the answer to this which is typing the answer to this
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> you've been dating her for months now right?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Man, I thought you were married anyway????
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> plus, i had an uncle who had 2 wives, they couldn't live together in one house.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> Track her down and ask her what gives.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> and she will save you alot of heartache even though you dont believe it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> in a joking kind of way.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_30> A guy they can't figure out drives them nuts.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> So I suppose God thinks animal-luvin is okay!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> TRUST IN MOMENT AND LIVE IN JOY
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Believe in true love, it is out there, but don't go looking 4 it and dont look too hard.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> OK I'll tell you what it is but promise you'll never play with your dad's computer once again.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> We fight because he doesn't seem to care that much...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Don't hate me because I'm honest.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> sorry, you need to figure that out, that is something only you know the answer to
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> My daughter says she hates it here and wants her daddy back.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> flowers and sweets won't do it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> 42% of guys are good guys.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> Three Fwd=> Wishes: Grace => Mercy => Peace.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> if he doesnt know what you are worth then he doesnt deserve you in the first place.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Girl I think he's playing both of you..He probably don't want either of you
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> Don't force anything, that's the key.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> If you have to ask you have a lot to learn.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> i had myself done this with my girlfriend a couple of times- and not for cheating!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> If you get a reaction, great.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> But those your man love you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Talk to a buddy, the men at church, people who I wouldn't worry about.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> If they have not, then it is completely wrong.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> TWO: She could be cheating & shes afraid you'll know or already does know.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> ask him what he thinks of you
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> talk to her about why she doesn't want you seeing him.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> If you want a genuinly good guy, just be yourself, and love yourself and that guy will find you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Maybe HE should dump your butt because you're an OLD STORK!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> WELL THINK ABOUT IT WOULD U WANT UR BOYFRIEND DOING THE SAME THING TO U. I DON'T THINK SO.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Why didn't you go with her?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> It is sad to say that to most guys do care about weight.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Think about what you would do if u were her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Don't bother,  he probably isn't worth it anyway.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> DIAMOND RING THEY ARE GIRLS BEST FRIENDS
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> I don't care what it is...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> Nevermind that the guy might be a great guy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> Any guy who's out there and doesn't care about the girls feelings, isn't doing for the right reason.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> Is it too difficult to say GOOD BYE to somebody who treats you like garbage??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> i think u are a bit too young for a relationship.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> If you love him, keep lovin him.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> if i was to flirt with you it's because I like you.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> Nowadays with aids out there Sure it is a good thing!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> THAT HE HAS NOTHING 2 WORRRY ABOUT!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> If u BREAK your PROMISE, u Cannot be TRUSTED;  If she BREAKS hers, she is FORCED to do so.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> watch sports woth him and dont complain, suck his c0ck and bring him a beer
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> PLEASE, LEARN TO LOVE YOURSELF FIRST.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> i too, am going through the same thing.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> tell him that it is YOUR day not his.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> Are you freaking serious with this question...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> Or atleast until they breakup, and even then you should talk to her first...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> IF he really loves you look at what love is and what it is not.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> that is way to small for you and i and u should kno that.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> but still you cant get over him/her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> but just be his friend for now because it sounds like thats what he needs.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_40> let me knw the website plz.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> she kne wyou would get upset, thats why she didnt tell you before.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> If he's with a girl or married leave it alone it's not worth it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Why isn't he 'doing' me now?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> Love and trust, can't have one w/out the other!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> i found out to be nice to her and just be your self.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> But ask yourself What am I feeling, What is he feeling?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> (and I am really not trying to pass judgement here, just being fair).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Especially if you arent doing anything wrong.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> second: have you been drifting away from her?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> Of course, the flip side of love, is ...what?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> if you think about him in a cushhy way,don't!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> WELL.....FINK U SHOULD LEARN GRAMMAR PROPERLY AT FIRST...COZ UR QUES DIN MAKE ANY SENSE WIFOUT IT......
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> as man sex is a must must !!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> Need to impress girls, then don't try to act smart.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Well to quote Eddie Murphy It's a d___k thing.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> i fyou want an outdoor wedding with the leaves turning, the fall.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> because it always was my fault.its something alot of man and woman have just the don't all say anything.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Right and w will be married soon...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> not from dog not from  cat.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> when you find the one of corse
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> not at all,I never come online here.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> You can't really talk at all.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Maybe thats all you need to do.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> thats soo weird i feel the exact same way wow!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> IF YOU DON'T TRUST HER THEN YOU DON'T LOVE HER YOU JUST THINK THAT YOU DO.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> im headed to chicago one weekend a 12hr road trip
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> You can't really talk at all.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Maybe thats all you need to do.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_15> thats soo weird i feel the exact same way wow!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_15> IF YOU DON'T TRUST HER THEN YOU DON'T LOVE HER YOU JUST THINK THAT YOU DO.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> im headed to chicago one weekend a 12hr road trip
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> I think u should forget about her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> or by not trying to look at him much.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> Tons of fish in the sea!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> the same reason why everybody else falls in love, attraction
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> you dont have to but maybe sumthin tellin u to stay there and sumthins givin u hope!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> look into his eyes.. classic but works :)
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> Then I KNEW that I knew I loved him.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> i think its good to b protective cause it shows how u feel about her am i right
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> Oh yeah... take lot's of toilet paper for those moments that... you know !
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> you could say well hey buy me a coke and we'll discuss it!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> i dont want him to give up on me because we cant find anything to talk about.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> my man is a good 8'
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> However, if you're YOUNG AND HORNY, TRY THE BATHS.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> It might be more to this Question if you know what I mean.........hmmmmmmmmmmm
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> in other words he just wants a piece to tell his friends about.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> give him more time...guys take longer at these things.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> That's the same thing I'm going threw with my wife
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> If u HURT her, u are CRUEL;  If she HURTS u, u are too SENSITIVE!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> Tell him I said good luck with that.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> you will find someone who loves you back, because if he did he wouldn't hurt you.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> any kind you want to ask.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Especially if he/she really not cheating you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> I hope this helps a lot of people     out there.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> tell him the truth in a letter dont ever make him wait u as u will break his heart
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> you gotta take a chance, or else you'll never know.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> You guys are still kids yourself wait until you are married.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> And glad that I have the best of both worlds.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> best advice, hook up with her outside the job.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> there is help out there but who really needs it right.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> So I need your advice guys and girls,what should I do next?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> I don't know, I don't care, but your attitude is totally hot.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> just depends what type of music u and your partner are into.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> you are a very smart young lady.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> U did not make a mistake u said what came from your heart.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> BECAUSE WHAT YOU HAVE IS EXCITING AND FULFILLING IN WAYS YOU NEVER DREAMED OF.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> no that would not be dumb becasue you think ya'll are good for each other go for it
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Depends upon the man, of course (whether he is her type or not), but sure!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> 25 as long as the man is long and strong
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> if you know any girls then ask them to be your gf
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Well does he say he does?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> You really can't answer that question as male or female......It just depends on what type of person you are..
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> i would take a step back and look at which person makes me happier and why.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Depends on what you wanna know.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> i you realy love him dont brake with him just because people said things.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> I've never cheated on my wife.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> myself... there's this one girl... but havent asked her yet
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> depends on who is watching it...
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> well i dunno... nobody slept with me when i was 8 yr old... LOL
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> she gets rid of guilt by confessing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> (sorry about the run on sentence!)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> Yes he CAN, but no he SHOULDN'T.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> hmm.... gotta agree with Batista cant argue there.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> Hell, what do I have to lose?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> Love him if you love him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Simply don't agree to go out with him if he asks you again.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> keep yourself busy with other things so it will keep your mind out of the hunting thing.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> but seriously, just go up to her and talk to her.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> ahha then she will stop thinking she needs to fake it if indeed she was.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> if you like the guy, dont date him.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> But you don't see me murdering anyone, do you?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> if he looks at you a lot and likes to be around you and acts funny around you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> ask her if she wants to.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> 2 people, no matter how much in love, have ups and downs in their relationship.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> It dont matter who u fight with, what ppl say, or who looks at u funny!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> lets her know u noticed her in a deeper rhelm.... not just the lower body!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> If she is interested in him the answer is NO!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> If he truly loved you, he wouldn't be with her!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> preppy,trendy punk,goth plain or fusions of styles?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> OW  glad i didn't know the answer
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> PS- if u ever go to mexico get some yoli soda.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> accepted him as only my frnd so that i dont loose my love!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Who did she get HIV from?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> Who knows why she is cold
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> i like my man to be tall it is so sexy....
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> By the way I love a sexy man.How old are you??????
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> No need to be hatred .... if u are confidence in that images so go on !!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> if so, then to answer you question.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Girls don't just see money or looks.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> well i agree with u because im addicted to it :)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> just keep getting caught up- and MOST of them can't even lie good to cover their tracks.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> of course there is what a silly question
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> A man being kind to a girl is sexy...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> youre out on a date and this guy grabs your attention is it rude to gaze?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> i wish i could tell him enough.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> He should love you tons of bunches of oodles anyway.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> keep it professional on the job.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> im in the exact same position.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> you should not give them your number.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> if he says i love you don't say it back to him unless you really mean it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> he can but it is considered cheating and no one likes that!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> Only if the guy doesn't think the girl is hot(unless, he has better, but that is not foolproof).
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Walk up to her and say hi.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> sex=is sharing and fun but,not that important.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> u need time.. so stay away from gals.. n concentrate on WORK only!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Rock On...uh..I mean keep saving energy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> when you get right down to it its amazing how much abuse a woman can take.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Im not a big fan of gay people.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> well it is a good norm, but it has been turn off these days.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> because men have a hard time getting over losses.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> SOME MEN ARE STUPID AND MAYBE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WANT, SO THEY PLAY GAMES.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> i dont wanna just randomly go up nd be like GO out wiht me?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> it's your wedding, whatever you like.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> (hey just kidding  i thought  i would be funny )
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Don't let the idiots get you down, there really are good men out there.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> i myself tried to get help did it work for me no .
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> insecurity is not something you can talk him out of.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> If you guys dont trust each other and you're engaged...what is it going to be like when you're married?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> please help me 4real... i been worried about dis 4 a while....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Omg, that's why I doesn't have a single girl friend in my life.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> it's very gross.. its where you eat out the poop hole
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> I mean come on man, you've been up here asking about girlfriends for atleast 3 times.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> But hey, who can they blame?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i think it means that u like that person very much tell them u like them
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> they are my brothers and we would do anything for each other.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> No not until they get to be adults.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> 2.1) If yes then back off dude... Give respect...  3.0) Does she know you like her?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> also, i'm not sure if there's a way to about finding a soul mate.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> She's 15 ... give her a break.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> admit it ladies, its what every young woman dreams of.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> sounds to me he is still in love with you and wants anouther chance
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> india is that place where u get all types wedding traditions.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> I had some neighbor guys who were gay..they were so much fun to be with!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> She probably doesn't want it gave out...K
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_25> Kick her out or move out yourself.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> but it's not abnormal to envy ppl.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> I like Smack my b**ch Up by The Prodigy  :-D
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_25> is any one try it ?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> if you ever figure out the answer let me know!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> are they just saying that to be nice?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> thats what I think of speed dating
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> alot of fighting, jealous would be involved
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Love, whenever u feel something special about somebody.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> for a girl or a boy
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> knowing that girls do wait for the guy to tell them.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> its the inconsiderate and egotistical men that couldnt care less about anyone but themselves.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> this does not seem a real marriage.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> BTW I'm still laughing at your use two hands answer on that threesome question :P
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> I'm guessing your asking because u either shaved in that area or thinking about it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> It just means you are scared to meet new people, nice guys, etc.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Do what u think is best.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> i was in japan for over 3 years.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> u should have told him before he hook up with other girl.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> why not ,put tell him that
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> that's a bad way to get over someone.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> She likes to go out with you alone....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i've asked myself this question several times.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> and it's hard to get back on the playing field.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Yes it still exist even today, but finding it is the tough part...K
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> Camiguin island man... that is sooooo damn nice.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Tools and Gadgets are always good, heck even a bottle of his favorite booze!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> She either will be okay with it or she won't.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> It can and will happen someday!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> my ex broke up with me a year ago.. .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Did you leave out a word, like don't?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> 20+ just so i'll sound clean.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> What do u think the guy is thinking??????
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> i've been dating someone for 10 months now.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> cause their are plenty of gals who can plz ya!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> take the guys that do like you and get what you want out of them
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> yes i believe in true love.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> then leave the room until she cools of and come back and talk to her.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> Like a married couple but of 3?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> If he's wrong you'll know don't be like me and deny it.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> you better B the bigger person and tell that person you like them B4 some 1 else.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> She finally got outta dodge and moved to another state.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> tell the guy to buzz off and go find himself sumone else to bother.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> finish college get a nice stable job both of you.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_50> I say take a deep breath and go on!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> Well if he's mean to you then why would you wnat to be friends with him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> most men dont....most of us like nice fat azzes
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Cld spoil the friendship if u say that in a romantic-like way
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> I do'n know .... gods know :D
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> ask yourself why would you want to hang out with a depressed person.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> if he start making rude hand gestures then he likes you.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> u have to just give it up.
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_25> be friends in the end if you can.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> you will never know if she'd go out w/ you unless you try.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> education honey you never get to old to date
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> The procrastinator you probably can't do much about because a lot of men are like that.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> i dont think you are in love with him that would be incest.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> you will never know if she'd go out w/ you unless you try.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> i dont think you are in love with him that would be incest.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Basically dont tell her you are cheating on her and she wont worry about it anymore.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> but you should know if love is there dont tel her show her
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> dont get in the middle of a fight.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_10> I THINK GUYS LIKE GIRLS WHO ARE CONFIDENT NOT COCKY
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> its plan as day u atleast wanna be friends so he couldnt have been all that bad...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> People will either like u, love, u hate u, or dont care either way!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> I work alone with a girl and I find her very attractive.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> How about you marry him and see?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> No you do not have to or need to quit your job .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> things might change when you get out of school.know what you want!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> get your fiance to talk to him about it too!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> ofcource we need love cuz love is the best thing that could happen to u ......
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> Get a life and dont worry about their lives.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Try the old I know you love me, but..... line.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> I luv Green Day so he would be like my cousin or something cool like that
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> the best thing is to do is follow it heart!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> fOLLOW WHAT YOU WANT TO DO DON'T FOLLOW THE CRITISISMS!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Maybe she is cheating on you.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> maybe she's just better than what he ended up with.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> sometimes they dont and sometimes well there just play hard to get or flirting or just being him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> if you want to be around him then you might just like him for right now.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> She was like ya I kind of figured that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> I've seen to many good men get hurt so dont subject yourself to her icy breeze...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> you will know it you will feel it
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Women love tall men makes them feel like they are protected and it is sexy!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> just kinda hint it, by hangin out with him more, takin his side in arguments, ect.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_55> doing the deed where i shouldnt have
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> If hes a guy and hes alive, yep .. you guessed it .. hes cheating.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> get rid of anything that reminds her of you & don't put her personal info on the web.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> But, then u support your sponse anyways.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> you gave me a mental picture!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> sounds like a non sequitur to me.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Yes for me, HE is so attractived ....
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> when you meet your mr.right, you'll just know!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> But, then u support your sponse anyways.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> you gave me a mental picture!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> sounds like a non sequitur to me.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Yes for me, HE is so attractived ....
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> when you meet your mr.right, you'll just know!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> Are you looking for a nice guy, or a bad boy?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> just spend time wit them... they are not gonna eat you.... don't you have sisters or cousins...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> A girl should not like a guy that doesn't like them at all.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> it turns out that he liked me too.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> yes , a guy and girl can be friends
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> best answer is to take life 1 day at a time.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> It just means you are loose.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> honey i wish i knew, because i am asking myself that same question right now!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> Did you actually like him from day one?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> treasure it grow with it that is a wonderful thing
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> How do u love the friend?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> I BELIEVE HE WILL; I LIVE FOR THE DAY...
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> Love is caring.... so on and so forth!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> I need to do it more.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> that mom must be crazy HE IS UR BROTHER
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> then you might end up cleaning the fish.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> if u know she'll come back to u.. wait for the time..
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER ABOUT THE HAIR HOWEVER I THINK SOME MEN WITH BALD HEADS ARE VERY SEXY
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> go for black or navy blue boxer briefs or briefs
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> But if its a play flirt or a wierd out look she has or something she probably doesn't.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> tell him that u r sorry n u wont do it again
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Not a bar, or an online dating service... Or speed dating UGH!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> ask him what will u do in your next new life that  you havent done before?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Of course you'll need a lot of gas!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> Jennifer E.    Just because I love her.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> :-)biting back do not mean you are a winner move on :-)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> ss wang chig you are funny.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> im usually fine with once or twice a day.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> why is this in love and romance!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Do you know why she suddenly stopped liking you ?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> do what u like and what u want to do.see how easy it was.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Makes watching that stuff a lot more barable.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> And how they'll be related 2 u!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> I don't know what mistakes he has made.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Every time I told him of my crush, he liked the girl too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> If he is so hot, ask him to do more workouts !
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> Run away with your boyfriend if nescessary, you say you love him right ???
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> c'mon now, you can't expect the man to not have friends on the basis that they are female.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> alot of my friends think i am gay but i do not!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> If nothing else if you really like her hopefully the two of you can be friends .
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> but you got to start some where.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> the same reason women cheat on 'em.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> during discussion about who eachother has been with this all got brought up!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> He's so awesome and i THINK IT WOULD BE FUN TO HANG OUT WITH HIM.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> try and think on the bright side
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> If u want so then be expectin her to have more than one...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> and i just don't know how to tell him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> You should try to flirt with her and see her reation to it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> Use to...but I don't give a crap what she does now...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> if not good dont get mixed up with those ones trust me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> no.. trimmed is fine.. don't mess with it too much.. it's wierd looking.. it looks like your 11..
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> If you wanna shave then shave, if not then don't.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> Or still living at home with mommy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> See, i'm shy too, so i always wait for a guy to approach me.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_50> Depends if you like it fast or slow?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> there are too many people out there for you to be hung up on a distant family member.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> i have noticed however, that to men female friends are only women they haven't slept with.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> men and women can go without sex pretty much the same.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> But...that was years in the making.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> there is a chance that they don't love you the same way.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> Ask him what he thinks is going on and where he sees it going.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> ONLY THE KIDS AND DRUNK PEOPLE TELL THE TRUTH...
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> please help me i really like him
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> well at 17.. everything is interesting about a gal!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> no, he constantly complains about your ratty hair and your snoring.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> They are no dummies at all!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> because that would suck if you made someone like you they should want to and she doesn't.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> there are a lot of things to do out there.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> I like when men dress nice.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> u are attracted to them or u really like them
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> But women want to be wooed.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> no ur not u just not mayb into that style of those girls u envy.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> Hey WISE FOOL...so is that the girlfriend or the pet?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Tease him a bit... without being mean.
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_25> that may hurt you in time.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> They don't realize they have a good woman until shes gone.
<NbChars_255> <LevSim_25> i don't think you want to be pregant at 17 do you
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> just get married......................and have sex for free for lifetime.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> to get a woman off with your fingers  ladies what do you like
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> men are really bad mind readers and us chics tend to just expect men to know what to do.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> do not have kids,  just keep getting abortions  trust me
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> cool lol...you have a good amount of time.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> She could put it nicer, or say nothing at all!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> Men just think differently than women.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> any and every thing if you dont tell them they will find out on there own
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> We're married now, so it worked!
<NbChars_375> <LevSim_20> Have sex for the kids sake.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> have some friends come with you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Shorter the better, even BALD is sexy!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> Finally PLS GO TO UR PASTOR OR LOOK FOR ONE IF YOU DONT HAVE ANY.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> but, what you should do is just be there for him as a friend.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> if you're gf has moved on so should you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Unless you gave him  some BD, no.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> me 600 ( like Wilt Chamberlin  )
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> THEY DO NOT GIVE PEOPLE A CHANCE TO LET THEM KNOW WHO THEY REALLY ARE.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> first you should start just to talk with, her hang out, just be her friend!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> 2_ you like the more knowledgeable loving laid back,  NOT SO HIGH STRUNG.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> i just flat out tell him...hey, i think you are hot
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> i don't think it could work.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> and if she doesnt like you anymore, ask her if it's still alright to be friends.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> She took it ok but then she went off on him last night.What can u do
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> sometimes they like that the girl has some control
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> and the fact that i've been married 3 times means that i must be looking for love.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Her name is Hillary Rodham Clinton.......good luck there Pal!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> First, i'll make a confesion...am no girl.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> I AM FUN TO TALK TOO OOHHYEAAHHBABBBYYYYY EMAIL IS:SEXIPOLKADOTS@YAHOO.COM
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> that way the adult would be able to watch over you where ever you would go.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_25> lucky for me i found my Mr.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> How do I break out of my rutt?
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_35> sincere girls are usually stuck with jerks
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> true love when u find someone need u and u need her
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> My friends & I like the Steak & B.J.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I like guys with dark, medium-length hair and blue eyes.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> i don't know why - i'm not a redhead.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> Short on cash: Do something uber creative!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_10> BECAUSE THERE IS ALWAYS SOMEONE BETTER OUT THERE.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> it is gay like you bitch
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> yes ,if there are five mens.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> it depends on ur girl, or the girl u want (to get) .
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> GOOD LUCK AND I HOP EVERYTHING WORKS OUT FOR YOU 2!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> As Mom says, if you do not have trust, you do not have anything!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> Hope this helps, and good luck!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> U don't,but may be u want to?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> Just lay it on her easy
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> it may hurt a bit (so i've heread) but the pleasure is even better...it's real SWEET!!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> uhmm no words can describe it u just feel it
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> I now keep my crushes to my self.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> You have all got to be out of your mind!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> I GIVE UP.... NO, I KNOW THE ANSWER!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> I like a guy who doesn't even know I exist.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> He's a jerk and a loser.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> I had another boyfriend and Im sure he had another girl too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> life without love is not a life at all.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> I'm a hair and eye guy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> No No NO a girl with flwt ass No body likes
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> If he didn't hate you, most likely you wouldn't like him anymore.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> ask him if he likes corn cobbs in his ass
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> if he proves it to you everyday
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> vow to make sure she realizes what she is missing
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> -Love is to tell her how much I like her, how much I love her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> like everyone else said--have ur partner open them..
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> brush her/his teeth with your tounge
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> Next, if you really want to go, THEN GO!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Hang in there, move on, and keep looking!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> sure you have to be a little patient
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> the little things count more than sex.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> no  i know that and i'm twelve
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> B) He thinks/fantasizes about you a lot.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> (I REALLY DO THINK THAT WAS A GOOD QUESTION...)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Any thing i guess but make sure it is fancy
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> i say go for the one who you want
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> dont tell until ur bf tells
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> sure but dont expect to have a wife for very much longer!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Dude u really got some problems.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> i cant see your picture its to little
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> It wouldn't be rude to look though.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Talking on the phone for the first time after chatting online, I mean
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> .what can i do to get over it?
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> I wish he'd just 'do' me!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> and not by sex or any kind of sexuality.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> if u loved him at first, u will alwayslove him
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> Depends by what you mean by bad.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> (ANYWAYS YOU ONLY DO THIS TO YOU LOVEONES OR GIRL SO YOUR PRETTY SURE SHES NOT INFECTED OR SOMETHING).
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> if she doesn't then look for someone else.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> u got lots on ur mind!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> No idea......but that would make a great song title don't ya think?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> I'm not a stupid woman and the guy I was with didn't always beat me.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> that all depends, are you that baby's daddy?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> A unique question for you girls!!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> fool me once, shame on you.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> Im going to marry this man and I can’t do this forever.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> what about more than one photo?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> cmon u need to giv dis guy a break.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> no i haven't (i've done it)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> men are visual; that simple but I like inner beauty
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> 4.0) Are you sure you like her or you are just impress with her?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> if you get a bigger picture then maybe you would be but as for now i really cant see
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> unless that was what you were hoping for!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> only if there was drinking, singing, and a rubber duck involved!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> any kind of question that you want.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Just look for a single man with kids of his own.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> If its higher, consider buying him a video game or something like that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> I agree with curious trav... go on, ask her, and see what happens, lol!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> my spouse and i both like to have sex alot
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Those are ur true friends... not the ones ur fighting with over a guy!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> is it even possible to throw in the towl and find your soul mate.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> John Schneider has aged very well...i loved him on The Dukes of Hazzard!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But I haven't given up and you shouldn't either!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> if you were financially well off, then would that matter?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> that is just the way the most guys are and that really sucks
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> i have a titanium wedding band -- it's cheap, but looks great.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> no .a guy that can wear feminine clothes and is still straight shows that hes comfortable with his sexuality
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Plus, that way you can go to a later movie.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I don't pay her to talk.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> 4.1) Like and Lust is diff...  Email me...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> ...a guy who dresses up all the time?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Like me, my two uncles and and my grandfather.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> even the girl shouldn't mind in the first place if she really likes you.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_25> 4.1) Like and Lust is diff...  Email me...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> ...a guy who dresses up all the time?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> Like me, my two uncles and and my grandfather.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> even the girl shouldn't mind in the first place if she really likes you.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> when the time comes you ...........................
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you want to marry , you have to see marriage adviser and talk about it
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> you shouldn't regret anything you did.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> {just make it work and it will if yall and love}
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> they stand on street corners at night.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> He wants to fuck you, so bad but socially there is no way is hell he can.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> it depends on what kind of fat azz the boy has
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> person cheated on me with at least two other men after we were married.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> every body lies its just easier to take advantage of when ur a drunk
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> me i wanna be your friend mail me harryblehnabladder@yahoo.com
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> WITHOUT being too flirty or looking like a s***
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> it really depends on what sort of grunge girl you're talking about.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> neither...i think trust is the most important thing
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> wait until you are both 18 and have full-time jobs with benefits
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> im 19 years old but i will soon be 20. i have been in a relationship for 3 years.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> whats the best way to get a guy to notice you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> try wearing boxers 4 a change.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> girl most men and women cheat cause they are not satisfied in their currrent relationship.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> His name isn't Sean is it??
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> then just pkay it cool for the moment.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> i mean they don't know what they want.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> I am in my second marraige and it sucks.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> nothing that could happen cant be overcome!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> Dont worry about boys untill your about 21.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> But nice and slow love songs.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> if he says yes then you can ask him,Have you ever considered me more than a friend...?
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> (At least that is how it should be....*cough*)
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> his name is Phillipe and he is SOOO LOSER !
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> find a new girl friend and get on with your life.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> if he says yes then you can ask him,Have you ever considered me more than a friend...?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> (At least that is how it should be....*cough*)
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_30> his name is Phillipe and he is SOOO LOSER !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> find a new girl friend and get on with your life.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> ok so he is my best friends boyfriend and i've known her since we where in prekay.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> god bless to be always young.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> id never cheat on my girl but i know a few men that would and i know thier type.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> you rock~ you have a lucky girl ;)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> love is a waste of time.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> (get out of the house) That too!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> if you ask this question you can't...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> I didn't know I even had a girlfriend.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> So yes it's okay to read the menu; just don't do it around your partner.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_10> YOU MAY END UP GETTING HURT AND WE DO NOT WANT THAT NOW DO WE?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> Don't try to make her realize what she's missing.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> who gives a fudge just have sex with him
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> if she is a visual person she likes beautiful things e.g.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> If u SMOKE, u are BAD BOY;  If she SMOKES, she is a GENTLELADY.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> i learned that the hard way
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> I think guys go for brains and beauty equally!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> ask this to urself..u'll know that..close ur eyes..relax urslef ..u'll get the point
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> I thought you had an answer...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> or i can't believe you did that!something like that but try not to do anything bad.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> come and meet me i will give the answer
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> if you like each other then stay together  they are just trying to hurt you
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> I WILL SUCCEED ON WHAT EVER I WANT TO ACCOMPLISH...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Do you kick butt every time you pick up a basketball?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> If a guy can take a girl out then a girl can take a guy out.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> It was Brutal but hey, I'm alive & kicking!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> a walk in the park was my first date i loved it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i really don't see the problem here.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> :-( So what do i do?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> that means that......ummmmmmmm........... u get down on yourself 2 much!!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if you find her, chances are she is better off than you.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> well they arent prefered but if the rest of her is hot,hey life is full of comprimises
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> wish to participate in yahoo chat w/java applet
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> make some friends and expand from there :)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> if your friend is not worth fighting with, dont date him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> u can fall in love w/ one and have it work out
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> seeing as most likely the picture is already seen, voice is the only thing left to imagine
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> hmmm...first u jst confirm tht whether she loves u or not?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> i guess you are asking too much dude.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> you shhould wait if the guy cant respect you and ur body then screw him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> say i love very much,i not live without you
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> why let him come to you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> SONGS THAT HAVE GOOD BEATS, SO YOU CAN DO IT TO THE BEAT OF THE SONG
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> watch the music video i should have cheated by sumthin cole and listen to what she has to say!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Eh, I don't know what to do.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> Your true love is out there....find him!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> Oh, kitty cat stop playing with us.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> For me, a shaved guy is a huge turnoff.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> i need a white lady as my wife
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> talk to people let it out and read
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> you need to get things straightened out with them, and yourself, before you go any further with anyone.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> ima take a shower but never do !
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> about 3 billon man on earth!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> don't make babys, don't go for anything serious, serious relationships rarely work out after highschool.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> ask him when your doing something you both enjoy
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> Fools fall in crap too.What's your point?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> still, do not just do these for the reason of meeting your soulmate.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> Try telling him it's personal, or that you don't like anyone, or you don't know...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> AND THE REST OF YOUR QUESTION IS: I NEED A SINGLE YOUNG WOMAN WHO IS 18???
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Why are you so obessed with lifting men?!?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> maybe you shouldn't be listening to what your friends think.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_30> forget about the guy that doesnt like you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> i like my boys hair with braids and waves too cause that's wat i do i braid hair!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> well i dont think there really is any perfect man for a certain person out there.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> Do something really nice for yourself.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> that would be the stupidist thing!!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> it will really hurt his ego a hell a lot!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> Don't try to understand it if you ain't got one
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> I need me one of those  Then hes thinking Gawd, i hope she didnt see me staring.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> I'm in love with A, but I think my bestfriend X in love with the same girl as I.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> It is all in your hands after all!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> Right now I'm saving my virginity so I can give my ALL to the one God gives me!!!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> tell her he is ur bro!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> good boy - you did the right thing.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> And when I do, she throws a big fit... WHAT SHOULD I DO?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> easy if he keeps staring at you and you can see that then he loves you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> i HAVE BEEN TO THAT ROAD BEFRORE AND YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE IT!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> If you look anything at all like yout avatar, I can guarantee you that she deos!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> 2-5 years, depending on your age.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> If you love her, then Marry her.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> if you like him you could wait for him
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> Y DOES SHE NOT TRY TO GET ANY MORE FRIENDS.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> i hang out with him every day because he wants me to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> and usually wiht nothing to say because we talk about 5 times a day.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> i don't know what u mean.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> depends on what you look like and how ur personality is.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> He may actually be the one and you would pass him up just because he makes a good friend???
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> - If you see this Amber, I love you!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> having sex doesnt mean you love someone.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> yes, from personal experience, if it's small, it's not gonna do much at all.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> You have been wishy-washy for 4 years!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> do them because you want to.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> If he has a new phone number get that too.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> it dissapoints me to hear woman say let the man approach you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Of couse your girlfriend isnt going to like you meeting other girls.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> do u want people to know.. y u'wre mad about her?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> ask her why she doesnt like you anymore, for one.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> Ok ok I straighten up... just quit telling everyone.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Don't worry, you and your sister will see your dad.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> atleast give urself some time..  best sugestion is to work..work n only work.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> I bet he's got the smallest penis ever.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> why am i always the one calling?
<NbChars_255> <LevSim_30> i think best for mans 25 between 30 for ladies 24-28
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> because then its genuine and her heart is safe!
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_50> have sex during her periods dont need to use condoms
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> i,m not gay but buy you need to  get help if you not a kid you act like one.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> Yeah, same thing happens to me (I'm a tomboy so I don't have any girlfriend, haha).
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> its really really sad :'( its hard for most people to imagine a life without love but....
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> it's ok to try finding someone but be yourself doing it don't try to be who you are not
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> I wouldn't do it but if women can wear men's shirt, boxers, wifebeaters etc..  why not.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> if he doesn't respond to you, mae sure he's not cheating on you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Being young is one thing...being immature is another.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_25> Well I love Braids on a guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> not really because when they r shy they are probaly hiding something
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> I actually dated a girl like that.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> about your spous/bf/gf/person you like and/or love?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> And it means more because you made it!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> by the way.. y did u put the link for her profile??
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> for a booty call,im on the first plane!!!

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> well, i have people answer my question.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> like squeezing warm mud through your toes
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_40> .....however, you are going to make your own decison, good or bad.

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> well, you sure call me hot all the time so why not?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> Repeat after me: Dump Him, Dump Him, Dump Him.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_25> Start asking him ALOT who he likes.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> If he says No, at least you had a nice Valentine's Day and can start looking for Mr.

<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> go for it and have fun
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> Well, I think you should try to go out with friends.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> They just have it going on but u dont wanna risk ur relationship so lay low.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> We don’t like baby daddy drama and most of us don’t want the responsibility of having kids.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> chances are its some sick A$$ petifile or a fake picture!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> Even though im a guy its easy to say.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> If he been saying stuff he never said before and your surprised don't worry.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> I see it this way: you know the people handing out Chick Tracts on the street?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> just feel bad that i'm upset.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> OK WELL FIRST OF ALL SAYING YES TO MEET A GUY YOU WAS TALKING TO ONLINE IS REALLY STUPID!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> and why would they need to lie?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> HE MUST HAVE DID SOMETHING REALLY BAD TO YOU THAT SOCKED THE HELL OUT OF YOU!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> so pick and choose your battle wisely..  good luck
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Tell her shes weird as hell.

<NbChars_170> <LevSim_15> Get over it dude, NOBODY WANTS A WANNA BE PLAYA!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> It's like the whole world stops and I can just relax.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> No, you are not doing it right, when you do you are gonna know the difference.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> Don't mess with married men, though; not worth the heartache for all concerned.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Young boys have a problem expressing real feelings (Old Boys Too!!).
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> Be lovable and the rest is up to her
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I don't know what to tell you!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> why is it so hard for you to ask?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> I have this book and I LOVE it!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> liverwurst cuz then i wouldnt get eaten cuz everyone hates liverwurst
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> he needs to get over it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> most guys i know r such jerks!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> i thing it may be usefull
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> saying it doesnt mean you mean it.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> I dnt call but i Chat!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> common boy dont try to complain betwwen girls and animals...all girls gana get mad at you!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Do something nice and lovely, not too girly.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Unless the boy is like 10 years old, I'd say no...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> But if he just is inmature or something like that there is always hope.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> it's cheating but yes you could do it.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> once established, ask him if he wants to go to a gay bar of some sort.
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_25> If he scares off, his loss.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> but if u are married and have a boyfriend.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> I say TRISexual is the best ........be open to anything try anything once!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> yeah if you find the right guy
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Ask yourself a few questions... > > Do you like your boyfriend?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> i certainly don't think so, you shouldn't either.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> Then of course, jewelry never hurts!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> And NO, I am not gay.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> So if you've got a dirty mind, go with that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> i went to aucopuco mexico and it was beautyful.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> alright, i like this guy, but he already has a girlfriend, i think, but i can't tell!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Porn can definitly spice your sex life up.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> If it is truly love , then why call them a fool?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> if u really love him and he loves u .at the begining we didn't know we were cousins
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> take care, hope all works out - scott
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> And girls secret fantasy is to dominate a guy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> i hope some of this works for you!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> i would be scared to death if he even come close to me with that face.

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> i guess they are lazy to answer
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> let ur brother go n visit a doctor
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Even though Im a guy I seem to have the same problem.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> Simple rule - if someone wants you to like them, they'd be nice to ya.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> also make sure he knows that u dotn love him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> He kept saying he was over her and didn't love her anymore, etc.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> no way there will definetely be a major catfight!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> 1.1) If not then start there befriend her...  2.0) Is this girl in a relationship?
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> i never thought of night terrors.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> Find some one else to like ... if the guy you like hates you, why would you bother??

<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> wait,and if they break up you should ask her if it's alright to go out w/ him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But I am serious about that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> so for you seek always elders.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> If she loves you and you know it then you have nothing to worry about..
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> when you are not sure you will hear it in return
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> if u know she doesnt like him u have nothing to worry about.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> i always say actions speak louder than words.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> maybe u slept with to many girls?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> NO...just be cool and get to know the individual first...there is some scary shit on the internet.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> and then that night, massage her into a deep sleep.

<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> i say go with wat you like

<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> before we got married we had more sex than we do now

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> this question was asked about 100 times try too read and u will find the answer some where
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> but anyways i would not meet this person alone because as nice as they seem you never know...

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Not even an enemy or someone I don't really care about.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> you give him special attention and you flat out tell him that he is hott!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> If u do WELL in your exams, she says it's LUCK;  If she does WELL, it's BRAINS.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> Sadly, hes married n i'm married n .. no wait.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> You don't really get to know someone well watching a movie.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> Why would you be a fool for loving?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> Thats a while down the road.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> maybe because they just don't have any since and don'T REALIZE WHAT THEY HAVE UNTIL THERE GONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> I really think it has to do w/ jealousy though.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> try to find a new girlfriend.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> or probably wants to get to know you since you are family
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING THAT MIGHT HURT HIM.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> tell him that you like someone that you really ...Don't....like.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> U would not be normal if u didn't peek.....
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> but i know what to look for now.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> Go with your heart... or dont pick any of them!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> get a friend of yours to ask if she still has feeling for you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Just say right out,Man, it is none of your business.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> Girls dream of their perfect wedding day.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> i have one since 9 months
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just say right out,Man, it is none of your business.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Girls dream of their perfect wedding day.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> Yep ,,, it is best to just tell em straight out
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> just ignore the guy if nothing works.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> i have one since 9 months
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> THEN YOU SHOULD CONTINUE TO LOVE THIS PERSON AND BE WITH HIM AS LONG AS YOU CAN.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I know I be like that.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Lady S gone always keep it real.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> Whatever you want him to do for you, just ask.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> And he definitely knows.. you're gay.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> But here's a     TIP..TRY TO MAKE YOUR QUESTIONS INTERESTING.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> If my wife looked as trollish as his wife does I sure as hell would be cheating!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> the things he says to me.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> im a guy but it doesn't hurt it actually feels good
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> You should go up to him and talk but dont force it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> weve been togather for 1 year and 3 months
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> u guys still have ur whole life ahead of u please dont ruin it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> I get turned off by greasy gross men.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> HE CALL ME NAME LIKE FATGIRL ,PORKCHOP ECT.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Don't let her fiance get suspicious.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> - so he could expect that from all the women he dates.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> you can't make her like you.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> No, I asked my wife to marry me on VD....
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> you really did what you should.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> We were friends at first and it grew into more :-)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> if you are not in love it means you are fool, with love life has a different colore
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> honestly, i say that maybe you should give it a try.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> He flirts alot but u don't know if he really likes or he's just feeling horny.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> u can tell him but if he isnt interested yalls friend ship will change
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> ?so just trust your sense and heart girl.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> Unfortunately, there are so many people in this world who gave it a bad name!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> Only time will tell I guess.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> at lest wait till both of uses get out of high school, but whatever uses do good luck.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> I felt bad about it because I didn't mean it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Well you have to ask yourself do you like him?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If he loved you like he said he does he wouldn't be dating her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> so there could just be some weird reason that he wants to keep hidin' or he's just protecting you!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> she says u are TROUBLESOME;  If u don't, she says that u don't TRUST her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> the way she acts with you !
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_25> Basically their head is pumped up!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_15> TRY TO GET HER OUT TO MEET OTHER PEOPLE.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> go up grab him on the ass and give him a kiss you shy bastar#.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> I want an HONEST answer from those guys who know what im talking about.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> I think redheaded guys are sexy, especially if they have freckles too.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> Now I feel like will never find the one.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> but lucky for you there are plenty of girls out there that would good luck
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> what are you afraid to tell her
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> Good LUck  One more thing... family will be mean to protect there loved ones!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Why would you bother exploring ANYTHING with other guys that you hate?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Now I feel like will never find the one.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> but lucky for you there are plenty of girls out there that would good luck
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> what are you afraid to tell her
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Good LUck  One more thing... family will be mean to protect there loved ones!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Why would you bother exploring ANYTHING with other guys that you hate?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> love, shopping, money, worries, kids, our looks....everything that men dont!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Hmmm... ever listen to the Dixie Chicks song, Goodbye Earl?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> close your eyes and ask yourself how to heal.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Maby she thinks you don't care, and is afraid to push it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> but Now I think i am the one I want.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> I'm 26 and I start to wonder if that day will come!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> As a guy, we want it ALL.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> how old over 10 not me
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> It's A Nice Day For A White Wedding  Billy Idol
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> ask another question and i'll tell you my e-mail!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> yes but if he is a war veteran its illigle.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> If from the first time, than that's the way you wife is.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> if so, you can provide such info on your yahoo profile.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Ok well i come from a broken home so i have (had) trust issues too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Men aren't necassarily stupid it is just up to us ladies to teach them the ways.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> you should make it a surprise party, and buy her alot of clothes from holister!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> But Youll Get Over It It Just Takes Time
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> please no more wood chuck crap or why is the sky blue.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> it is always ok with me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> they are the ones getting a divorce not you
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> won't work full time even though he has a full time job, addicted 2 marijuana and porn, procrastinator
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> And, no, men do not always go for pretty girls.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> you already got the sack dont you?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> the way he looks at me.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Then you're obviously NOT asking the right     s!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Say to the person that you really didn't meant to write that
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> well, actually, you'll just know and feel it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> He must do something nice next, and on and on until you see the REAL guy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> might not be a good idea.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> If you have to ask if it is a good idea than it is NOT A GOOD IDEA!!!!!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> If she starts flirting back she probably likes you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> i do not think it should bother you too much.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> I worked at a jewelry store, and one that I heard was...
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> 2 years been married for 14 years now & getting stronger.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> If you have to ask you haven't found them yet.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> a cake with 35 candles on it if possible
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> yes but don't do anything which will hurt your wife.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> talk 2 her and hopefully she will understand.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> u must not judge a book by it cover.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> do u mean most women like shoes and money?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> And i ask what is life with out someone to share it with.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> well than be with that person that u love!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> That is easy, kill the bastard.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> ha ha ha ha h a ha!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> you can't, you can only trust that he does.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> i myself am very shy on approaching woman to just even talk.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> YOU CAN ADD THAT INFORMATION IN UR PROFILE
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> jus letem cummm in ur mouth.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> No because you are desperate and selfish
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> she could have something wrong and may be afraid to tell you
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> we like to think about love ,clothes ,marriage,our weight,boyfriends,but most of the time we just worry
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> fate will find a way for the two of you to cross paths, after all, you're soul mates.goodluck!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> I DO BELIEVE IN TRUE LOVE.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> who knowshe might like u 2.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> try to be strong and try to act like you dont carewhat people says
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Example: Someone says I love it!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> first point out chicks  and ask him what he thinks of them, if he would tag it, ya know.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> SHE WILL DO IT AGAIN, AND AGAIN, AND AGAIN, AS LONG AS YOU LET HER GET AWAY WITH IT.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> Or understand what the heck you're saying.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> I've never heard anything about that... ...of course, I don't know what a whife is either.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> no talk to your wife maybe she's the one having the affair?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> Why in hell you like a boy that hates you??????????????
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> gosh...ppl these days r so shallow!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> Try that and come back to me after you come back of course!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> they are not dating, but he likes her,but my (girl)friend doesn't like him back
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Funny question but I say probably not!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> If he treats you badly then why does he deserve your love?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> wera condoms when u r cheatig on him so u dont get knocked up to another man.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> i don't kno how long u've known this guy but just be yurself!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> no sum guys just dig personality
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> Guy like girls that don't sound desprate and sound like they never had a real b/f
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> if i had that answer i could save the world
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> Yes, and when I think it could help people on Yahoo!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> beacause they are believe that girls are stupid and that they are smarter but is not real .
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> how rude, i would kill him!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> If it was my fiancee', Yes!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Find the ppl that will respect u, cherish u and the choices u make!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Additionally, don't give it up too quickly or easily, the cliche is quite true..MEN WANT WHAT THEY CAN'T HAVE.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> i like to have sex more than my wife does.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Because we look so damn good its rediculous
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> BUT I'D LIKE TO BE JUST A CLICK AWAY IF HE EVER LOOKS.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> well i flirt with the guy i like but i dont think he gets the pic
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> i was just wondering what was a normal amount to get it on was.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> Run her over with your car.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_20> No you should not, you should never beg a guy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Care for him for who and what he is.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> I can't imagine living without her...  Good luck ...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Im an aquarious, 5'4, and ok looking.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> why does he hate you and why do you hate those guys?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> why is it the guys job to go to you?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> he doensn't have to say it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> And then, use those words, I love you, they always work
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> IF IT'S SPIKED TOO THEN THAT WOULD BE FINE!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> if he does the you dump him like white on rice
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> Girls appreciate n like frank and bold guyz..BEST OF LUCK!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Do u reali reali like her?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> WHen I used to work...it was not a hard job!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> im sure its the same for a blind person.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> as sort of a warm up for a serious relationship with the focus on marriage.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> So do it, use it, pratice it... make it a day to day thing that u do!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> and 2nd Do I really love/like him?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> if he doesnt like it move on he's a jerk.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> And fellas can you be just friends with a girl who looks hotter than a Playboy Playmate?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> u shouldnt ask that type of question if u dont want your feelings hurt.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> You don't have to date anyone you don't want to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> you'll do what's right for you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> But by then things were just too messed up!!!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_10> ITS NOT WORTH RUINING A FRIENDSHIP OVER A BOY BECAUSE YOU LIKE HIM.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> maybe marriage would just not be my thing.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> every time you think about her  punch a wall
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> im 15 years old and my penis and balls shrunk.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> They do not see things the same at all.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Why not have both instead, cheap, small, nice cute one and not huge.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> She doesn't trust me and I don't trust her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> And what if you don't take a chance?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> Whenever you find that special someone and date them for a while
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I don't know what to do.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> if not interested, then he is gay.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> what if he decides to leave after you have a kid?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> he always writes back when i do email though.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> AND THE BEST WAY TO TEST THAT IS WITHOUT CONDOMS RISKY BUT IT PAYS OFF.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> please tell him ,he waiting ur invitation
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> well talk to her not to us  she the problem
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> and if start seeing a lot of things thru their eyes too.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> not all girls r that shallow it all abt their image
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> And yes, I am over 21!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> why do u want to do that?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> at this phase of ur life.. looking for a new girlfriend wud b absurd!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> i smile a lot with guys i tend to have a crush on.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> They think you are being nice to get into there pants.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> A pet , they can't cheat on you or disrespect you!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> dont ask that question here, you never know what type of answer you will get.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> U should move on cause u wouldn;t wanna hurt ur friend.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> as long as it isnt toooo.....
<NbChars_370> <LevSim_20> omg, that loser still cant get laid?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Like they stay dont get mad get even.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> count your blessing and she is a keeper and take her to meet your mother!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> if it feels good and then it does not matter do what you need to do
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> here's the real answer...( I'm a guy)...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Now I don't mean to disrespect them.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> date.com  I found my boyfriend of two years there
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> So cool to have it during a rennaissance fair!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> He keeps bugging me on who I like.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> He's your ex, its time to move on.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> which is not right at all!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> maybe one of your far distance cousins for friends?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> i think he likes me but i can't tell if hes trying to give me signs or not.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> And he would be my husband.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i wouldnt try to change a man toi be with him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> if she flirts, talks, hugs, and suggest it
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> So I guess it all worked out in the long run.)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> depend on if your boss is still asking for favor from you....if not you can keep your job.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> it's totally ok that's how i got one of my boyfriends
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> Take a drive somewhere liek the beach.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> in the mean time... GO GET UR MAN BACK!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_65> go out and see if it works
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> TALK TO HIM ALONE, either email him, call him, write him WHATEVER but explain to him!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> you should give it some serious thought.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> start kissing her neck playing with her boobs & prob you may end in pumping her ass
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> its old-school, but who doesnt love chocolate!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> breakup with him youll get more attention that way.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> i hope it works out and u get some good lovin!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Go and just have fun with this guy like you normally do.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Be a kid and have fun.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> ..so many promises were exchanged and now each one of them no longer existing.. .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> just talking can break the ice.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> But, if you want to be a one woman man, then you can look, just don't act on it.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_25> Why not.I would if i really like the guy!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> ask what her problem is, if he is your brother then you should love him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Tell him, if you do not, then you will regret it
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> he and she should show and say to the other that the love them.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> is a guy being a virgin good or bad in a gurls mind?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> don't do it make it a worth while relationship.not just friends with bennifits
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> Get up and get on with your day.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> If he's not then he might have a crush on u.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> there are the spoon full of kisses as ______ & _____ become mr. & mrs. picture frame seating cards.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> But my friend likes the shy guys.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> BOYS COME AND GO BUT FRIENDSHIP IS FOREVER

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> figure out which one you like best and go with him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> where are you starting from ?

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Most people just don't type fast enough.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> you're 55 that'll make him 60... you guys are old enough
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> dont worry, youll find that special one that makes you happy inside and out one day.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> and you couldn't imagin anyone else being there.

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> last longer there little timmy :)
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_30> You never had a 8 1/2 in penis.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> where ever you want.. except room...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> you can find nice ones but they charge a lot.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> And i dont know why you hate yourself.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Not if you want to enjoy it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> the worst thing you could do is make everything look the same and be the same.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> Maybe you like someone you are dreaming and not realize it!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> why would you want him into serious relationship right now?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> the only way to really know is to ask him or find out some other way.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Not if you want to enjoy it.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> the worst thing you could do is make everything look the same and be the same.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> Maybe you like someone you are dreaming and not realize it!!!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> why would you want him into serious relationship right now?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> the only way to really know is to ask him or find out some other way.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> oh yeah, tell her that you are sorry for the mishap.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Best of luck to you if the question is about you
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> After a few months, he finally got over her and I was right there waiting.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> ummmmm hell yeah it is more then probable cause to suspect something is up
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> I love mayo...wish I didn't but I do.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> cause hes a jerk or a dumb**s
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> i would tell you to pray about this.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> If you just want sex, then just stay away.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> You don't want him to think you're interested if you're not.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> Well girls flirt with guys or play hard to get.I hope that helps.☺
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Grab a beer and just have fun!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> But she is kind of like my friend now!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Depends on who you asked..the husband or wife.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> Stop calling him and he might start calling you, otherwise most guys like to play hard to get...N
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Does the baby deserve to have a life like the one that would be provided.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> But, why don't you just ask him and find out ?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Well, I just tell him... like, hey (guy's name), i've had a crush on you for (how long).
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> is there any one who would like to be an email pen pal with me
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> See of which kind she is?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> if you want to burn that bridge yes, if not no
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> it really depends on how long ago you broke up and who did the breaking up.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Oh man..........this will not end well no matter what.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> they do not have the same thig we do.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> i wii like to save this page for future, what can i do
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> (yes it was a sugar daddy relationship, i am half his age)should i have to quit my job?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> And you see him every day?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> get married for all your benefits even the child's
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> WITHOUT WASTING UR TIME..  later on u may ignore her or make up... depending on the situation!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> or it's just cuz they want sex REALLY badly and can't ask u.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> they should like u 4 who u r not ur height!!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> is it bad if everyone thinks we are virgins (even our friends)even though we DEFINATLY are not?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> U can tell by if he tells u that he loves u and treats u like he loves u.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> Hi there...well, welcome to the club.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> if they send a threat tell somebody you know or call police.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> I am betting you don't even have 1 g/f
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> But I do agree with you in that women tend to beat around the bush.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> It's your wedding and hopefully you're only gonna do it once so be creative and have fun!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> you don't have to say it...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> it is an affection u share with someone but not necsarily sex related
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> why do people ask dumb questions ??????????
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Guys like girls that just be theirselves.It works for me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Im not sure, I am thinking on that too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Have you ever heard of the words DIVORCE and KICK HIS ASS???
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> Even I wouldn't want that for my man.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Don't go out with him again until you decide.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Do you really want to risk having NONE??
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> What if he leaves his wife, and you ruin her life.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> he dribbles... he shoots... he scores... 2 points...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> if you have a guy that likes your friend wait first of all does he know you like him.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_25> maybe u can write him a letter and maybe he'll like u ,i did that before
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> (i was a bridesmaid & had to walk down a spiral staircase).
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> I do not think it is weird.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Maybe you should think about that when persuading a woman to trust you with her feelings and life.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> are you asking whichyou should go with?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> if you are a girl hump a pillow then you can feel it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> But u have to accept one thing.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> It's like I don't even want to know some of my guy friends after seeing them talk like that.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> :) How about a spa gift certificate?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> cos they dont....money and diamonds probably!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> you people with the dirty mind like mine!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> Or don't interact (no seeing, talking, e-mails, none of that) with any of them for a few days!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> tell your friend and take from there.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Thats how it all starts .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> (most girls...)  If you catch a girl looking at someone a lot, they like him.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> The evangelists accosting you in the mall?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> i guess you can wear them on your head for waves.....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> so dont let them change you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i think that is the best
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> Because too many women GIVE, GIVE, GIVE.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> be honest, don't lie, explain why it is over.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> it can be more than 1 song
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> you can  I think it's like $50.oo all you need to do is file at the local court house.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> if your bro id a cool guy then you should be happy.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> come out and tell him you are interested.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> -Worst, A already had a boyfriend....
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> Be smart and if he ask you to meet again tell HIM NO this is for your own good!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> P.S.you can also kill him you know...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> IT MEANS YOUR EARS ARE TOO TIGHT.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> Sit down, tuern off the t.v.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> Try for #4, it wouldn't hurt, would it?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> yes sure he can but i don't think his wife will be his wife again
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> My wife wants, and has changed me....Not really a good thing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> After all, isn’t that what I’m supposed to do?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Your life will make SOOOO much more sence!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> Maybe he could make u say Hee-Hee LOL
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> hi,i think u should know more about his life.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> if he is, then the worst thing to do is to break up with him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> you sound kinda geeky-looking to be honest.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I just don't know what to do.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> But do not let her run you'r life because of her problem.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> Well I hope I helped a little bit.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Jeez, yeah, 20 years ago !
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> she may just be finding you irriatating.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> might have a better paying job than you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> do not worry, they love you and it will not change their love for you and your sister.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> it gives you nothing but pain and heartbreaks
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> One day I realized that no matter what, he chose me.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> At least if you ask him to do things he does them right?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> maybe you should be interested in the older sister.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> You mean like if you tripped and fell on an erect penis??
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> if he acts like he doesn't like u, that means he doesn't.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> And don't be afraid to enjoy it yourself!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Come on, do u really need to him to send you home?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> Of course, a gurl and a guy can just be friends but dont get too close.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> if not the first thing to do is reassure her.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> you better not i tcould even be a male who knows
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> ASK HIM NOT 2 B SO PROTECTIVE!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Don't make a big production out of it tho.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> we men are usually pretty obvious
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> This is tearing me up, because I love the guy totally.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> So what do u think hes like?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> to festival.. out for lunch.. to have a coffee break...or for a movie if you are brave enough
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> You need to pick yourself up, dust yourself off and MOVE ON!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> If he is married, and still with his wife, then no, and he won't leave her for you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> yeah get your girlfriend to open them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> If he likes u and u like him what is the problem?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I suggest you read XXX: A Woman's Right To Pornography
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> So go 'head and look, that's what you have eyes for.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> IN A RELATIONSHIP IF YOU CAN'T TRUST THEM THEN YOU SHOULD NOT BE WITH THEM.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> personally, i like to confuse guys... i think its cute when a guy is confused!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> No it's fine, a big penis is a big PAIN!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> not to mention that it isnt a legal union and its just rather weird.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> So..first off I'm a girl and my best friend is a guy, haha.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> Supposedly men do have a G spot.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> I would have to say... bbq sauce, you can put it on anything and it taste good!
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_30> Guys do cheat, but not all guys.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> Bottom line: don't be AFRAID to be pretty.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> have a friend ask him for you
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> but u can see if he always looks at u!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> we talk for like 20 min during the day 4 times.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> on a moron would do that.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> he/she might be happy to hear that from you.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_35> If you 16, good, if your 27, bad.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> ask him if he has a girlfriend if not tell him you want to go out with him.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> up to u...but rem that u can choose wat to do but nt da consequences...think twice..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Not if you loved him and had alot of happy times together.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Because you aren't looking hard enough!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> Make sure you meet somewhere in public(there are alot of sick rapists out there)!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> So it;s the most popular emotion of our times :))
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> I want to be his friend because he is a nice guy.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> u don't have 2 treat urself mayb u will find a beautiful girl that is right 4 u.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> if that's the case, then he was just asking you on another date :P
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Men love a conversation starter like hey i had a dream about u the other night!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Robots and sociopaths do not feel love.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> just be yourself, take time and don't worry about those things.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> And what girl doesn't like that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> when she or he is all alone?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> give me dat ding, by the pipkins
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> only if you're in a coma
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> no because I would be a first timer too!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> there is nothing 2 impress any one , its a pease of love , try 2 sign in...
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> You will lose what you have and might not like what you get!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> a person that its alone has frustration and depresion get married
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> Sorry that was mean.... im sure your gran thinks your a nice guy/girl!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> do guys really want you to be yourself or do they just care about sexy and steamy types?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> So excuse me for being stupid!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> And I do not have a problem with them either.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> Means one of three things:  A) One or both of you is/are telepathic.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> YOU NEED YOUR OWN LIFE WE ARE ALL INDIVIDUALS AND NEED OUR OWN SPACE AND TIME.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> Because it really hurts when u feel like your man really doesn't get concerned about u.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> love is stronger than trust.. sad but true
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> talk to him, tell him you like him, and sees what he says
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> She then asked who it was and insisted so I told her Mike.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_45> so i missed my chance, you souldn't
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> if you think you are i think you are too!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> Somebody always gets hurt ... maybe you, maybe your partner, and maybe his/her wife/husband.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> I don't think it's just guys.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> hope you know plenty about sex day??
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> They tend to be tough on the guy...like rolling our eyes on stupid questions.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Thats pretty much how hes taking it!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Sunshine of my Life- Stevie Wonder
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> if she is a working woman she will appreciate the royal treatment!!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> well go for it   might be he is dreaming about you to!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Myself was laid bare, I realized in a way I never have.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> how abt I love you as a friend
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> buy her a zimmer frame...slowly but surely, she should come your way
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> how did he ever get a wife!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> do what ever feels right to you, even if that means saying no to your moms idea.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> If I had time, I would IM with her.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> is it her or you that is losing intrest?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> CAN I HAVE HER CELL PHONE NUMBER?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> Not all women like candles I don't
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> i think you should go ahead & tell him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> i think that im in true love but not sure
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> It is funny that you have to give up to win...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> plai old dark jeans and a nice soft botton up t if its before 10 after nothin!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Then when he wakes up he wonders what’s wrong!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Men cheat mostly cause they want sex!
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_40> well the fact that i am married to him means that i must love him.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> you should break up with him because before you know it hes going to breakup with you.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> Most of the time i think about all the fu***** bills i have to pay.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> I told her how we started talking and I apoligized to her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> also the last wedding i went to they did not have a favors.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I didn't find a mature guy until I met someone in their late 20s.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_55> so check this link u find answers for many
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> use gel.brush ur hair a cople of times.keep it alittle spiky.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> I wouldn't because you're the one that looks bad in the end.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Honest,trustworthy,faithful,funny,mature-childish or spoilt guys r boring, and dont forget romantic
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_20> bump into her by accident one day!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Not worring about what you have to say next?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> I don't have any idea how to go about tracking him down, but oh man was he hot.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> fuck all those people  if u like him and he likes u thats all that matters
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> Back of knees, arm pits, shoulders - they also work for me!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> PLEASE... LET ME WATCH AND JOIN... dont be afraid to experiment
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> there could be some weird reason why.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> That would be stabbin your boy in the back.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Don't worry about what other people think; they don't do it very often.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> and laugh it off.... and start a conversation about her smile or tell her she has great eyes!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> Depends, never get the wrong clothes size for someone, they'll never forgive you, but other than that...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> You girls cheat too, sometimes on great guys.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> and if they do how long do you think one would last?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> why talk in this racial way ,all human being do it in same way
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> ;) trust me this will work
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> nah....having it early is better - you get used to it quicker.

<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> if she's a beatch - well... good luck.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> actions....they can't be faked as easily as words
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> It really depends on the girl and the guy.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> you should get ur self a good atty.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> you sound like a sweetheart..i cant imagine you have trouble getting people to talk..
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> It's just most straight guys don't want anybody going there (myself included).
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> You dont have to like it but you do it cause you are in love.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> walk up and start a conversation.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> i like girls, i have never been in a gay relationship!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> It's dumb, if you would ask me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> hell yea i believe iin it.thats the best friendship u can have...lol
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> for meeh i like my guy to be taller than meeh...atleast there taller then me am fine....am about 5'1....lol...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Don't do it again unless you want to wind up dead in a dumpster!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> he can have a friend thats a girl, but no girlfriends, thats definetly a violation of marriage
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Try turning the TV off...do something nice for someone...one way to be happy is to help others.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> If he's just getting out of a marriage, I'd say NO ...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> ... because he focuses on the package and not what's in it.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> and being inlove is like, you have went through so many relationships.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Lot's of DIY stuff you can come up with.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> she told me she liked me.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> deepends on how long you guys have been dating for ?
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_25> and how do you like/dislike it?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> He brings her to the beach and they watch the sky writer spell out his proposal.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> Plus his voice is creepy too.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Jk but it could have been.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> To thy own self be true!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> My response to that statement would be is that good or bad!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> hmmm what do u put in the detail section???
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> I love thier eyes, I sometimes feel like I can see thier soul.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> Put a loaded gun to both of your heads and just do it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> its not the group of men that cheat.
<NbChars_270> <LevSim_20> fool me twice, shame on me.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> So if I could make anyone my love slave it would be him !!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> well, did he confront you about it?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> To him I don't do much..I'm expecting another baby.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> first you learn how to spell
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> I know it has to be hard on her and I feel for her.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> men would never admit to cheating,  they don't think that way.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> My mom met some guy on the net and she went to meet him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> bored to see this question again!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> I think youll get better responce.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> if it's just sex just tell him and perhaps he'll agree good luck
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN LOVE IN ALMOST ALL CASES SO TAKE ACTION AND SHOW IT.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> u should tell her in a nice way about herself and maybe she will try to change
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> When you ask him, What is it you love about me, what does he answer?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> It really depends on who the guy is and what they like.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> all i got to say is... go shopping!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Like the last post I read it's like a virus.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> you girls have to understand that its in our nature to cheat
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> any song that suits you and your grrom.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> i think its alright to lie a little bit...;)
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> NO BUT YEAH, IF YOU CANT WORK IT UR SCREWED WETHER YOUR 2 OR 9 INCHES.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> I wanted 2 go out with me 2 the school dance
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> be confident thats the key, and dont ask women because they dont even know what they love

<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> What if, when you find someone then, your kids don't take a liking to her?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If you have a good life with your wife then dont lie because liers get busted that way.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> it will hurt if he dont do it right and you may bleed a little
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> i have a class with him and he dont even look at me, its like im not there.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Dont let this man hurt you like i let mine.

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> well at 8.5 i must be huge then, good luck buddy
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> She probably is taking up offenses for her sister.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> If you want women to feel comfortable with you treat them like a friend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> you pointblank ask him if there is a chance of you two becoming more than friends.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> Sorry , I know this didn't help much...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> lurn 2 spel an mayk setants then b OK
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> no it isnt IF it is with the right person!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> I guess one day we all are going to find out!!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> she cant walk and can only drag.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> I HAVE forgiven my boyfriend for actually cheating.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> my wife DOES NOT control me......uh, oh, gotta run, I think I hear her comming........
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> so ill just say go with answers one and two
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> AGE AINT NUTIN BUT A NUMBER........
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> well just aplogize and tel him u miss him and u made a big mistake
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> No matter who you date, they will never be good enough for mommy and daddy.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> I DON'T REALLY LIKE THEM BIG.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> and remember the first time always hurts (ouch)
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> I went with him and it took like, five hours to get help.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> ask her out and make a move
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I have to, but she can be dressed in a snow suit and still .........
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> Looks as if he's not ready to be with 1 woman just yet.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> just let him come to you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> So please hold off on having sex!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Can't say anthing bad about it, that's for sure.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> If you DO meet, then she is no longer your ONLINE girlfriend
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> It's 2006, you don't have to anymore ~*laughs*~
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> it is very cute, it in a shy kind of way.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> Its a guy thing.... you wouldn't understand.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> any way you look at it, they're still just two people dating.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Im a gurl in the same sittuation.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> then, that's when he pops the big question.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> See for yourself what type of person he is, listening to other people is not always good.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> he respects me & when i`m not comfortable in any situation he stops.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> If will pay off in the end
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> the one thats suitable for him and loves him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> It was like o there she is go get he-  no thats a nun never mind.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> if she is gonna start dating on ur friend again, just act like u even dont know her.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> nope but im close April 18th Not.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> I am a woman and I do cheat with a married man.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> send a letter and a picture.....send surprises send
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> well u have to,if ur heart saying that u have to ask him out so do it,don't get late.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> as far as work the female works most of the time so be fair a man can do it
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> love cant be ever turn to friends
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> I like this guy but im not sure if he is gay.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> But I don't know why but I just don't like her as much as she likes me.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> he is 18 and she is 16 it would be different if he was older than that
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> If you get slapped forget I said that and go to step two.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> Remember the slogan, Just say no.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> you'll probably never see him again anyway!!
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_40> have a criteria you want in a guy.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> i no how you feel mine works 12 hr.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Candy is dandy, but liquer is quicker
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Baby girl, if u really want respect; don't give it away........ b'cos if u do then you've lost everything.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> But once you do have sex, it's gonna hurt.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> so.. im sure that was unhelpful, but its unfortunately true.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Ask her about her famliy and career.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Just because a thing is possible or even sounds right, doesn't mean it should be done.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> now the real question is why are you asking?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Im not really sure but I can give you some tips;  1.)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> thats how big u have to make up 4 it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Or any other furniture like it?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Nope you just have to give her time.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Hubby & I got married in the Napa Valley.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Then we went to his dad's house and watched Napolean Dynamite again and had tacos.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> i am 14 so do you have orlando blooms phone number??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> He used to like me, he would call me a lot.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> i love curvaceous figures, nice decent rack, looong smooth legs and a tight neat heart shaped butt.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> while sitting thousands of miles away?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> make sure it is mutrual and not one sided.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Love and Lust both lead to sex... but only  TRUE Love leads to marriage then sex
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> yes thats really wrong people get hurt like that you should be ashamed to ask that question!!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> i know it is hard .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Like I said, everyone has their own views... and I know about human sexuality :o)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> You... wearing something edible and sexy!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> hi i know this is maily for girls i guess?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> if he insists, then break up with him
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> yep, guys are really strange like that...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> (And if she comes up with any other answer, just tell her no!)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> do you get ur love from any other country?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> You'd be a nutcase to NOT want better.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> I think you would make anyone happy!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> if she really want you then it's not matter u are over weight or not......
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> or does it matter..keep in mind i would be a very good catch and a great hubby
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> now my guy friend and i have been spending more time together and we really like eachother.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> That's teetering on the edge of incest, Dude... ya might wanna stop that.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> tickle her the senastional parts and enough foreplay
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> ive been asking all my friends but they are trying there best
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Do you wanna have sex with him?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> if you wanna give it a shot, then go.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Don't do it unless you want to feel used.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Be choosy and you will find it!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> well, read this and then decide.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Couldn't find anything on the net....any info?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> well you are not going to fast.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> I am with out a dout I am straight
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> So all that time, sex was a disappointment and I didnt know why it was so great!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> someone i love...most people find it easy to love me...why not?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> If all the girls are saying he is a jerk, he probably is.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> nothing can keep u away from true love
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> yes...especially if you have open sores in the mouth area.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> It's amazing...it's like looking into a wee thumbnail cartoon mirror!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> It's impossible to put back together again and it is just too much!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> he was at one time, about ten years ago, now he is just....not
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> BTW, you answered my gothic question...e-mail me, moojastar13@yahoo.com Byez!
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_40> he he u r in love
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> he has disrespected you completely , that sould make him poop on your shoe right !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Blue 'cause its my favourite colour
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> hoochie mamma marries loser.....what a model marriage.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Girls want a confident guy just like guys want a confident girl.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> If u guys r meant to be, then YES...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> cause they think theyre better than gurls are
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> There is a such thing though....I just had a baby, don't touch me!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> and no ive never been left bc of my sexual past!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> a nice model of wrist watch will do.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> i've always wanted to be rich and have lots of ***.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> They dont care and your involved with the wrong guy!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> And they have an 8 year old son together.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> in my experience,,, if you have something in the front,,, your gonna take it in the rear.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> It is YOUR wedding and you invite only the people you want to!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> first of all how do you really feel about this lady?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> There's no way to fix something like this.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> yeah beacause mayb she isnt ready yet and later on she will
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> ok, first off, only women can tell you that answer.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Who did he cheat on you with and why?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> you will know when it's right
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> go for it before he is gone
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> My hubby offered his heart and I took it!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> so were do i find a 30ish good looking women to fill the part?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Kid with her then walk away.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> IF NOT, THEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF THINKING TO DO!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> yes, unless there is an attraction
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> If he is not pushing you to have sex, then don't.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> there are many different things for the two of you to try to spice things up a bit!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> they r all jus hoes and u r not u r a decent beatiful woman!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> just be like are you PMSing(if its a grl)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> so far i have even had trouble saying anything at all when she is around.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> but yeah anyways i dont do that because i wouldnt want to make the same mistake.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> Get over it, and move on.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> you might be looking because your curious everyone is so dont worry about it.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> It shouldn't take too long if you know what you are doing
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> but even they have a soft spot.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> I guess to hide their past.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> This is also what I tell my girlfriends...really, man and woman are very similar.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Is not worth it to try again.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> oh no will she like me.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> thats life im afraid, get used to it i had to
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_20> we're everywhere, but i'm in los angeles
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> So, when you talk to him.....try to put your heart aside and use your head!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> he's old enough to be your father!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> My guy feels the same way  , I hate it .
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> theres no way you can fallin love with someone who you know nothing about.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> if you dont like him, and you dont want to date him then the answer is no.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> yes, wanna come over for supper?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> Some one who I can talk to open minded!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> The rest of your life would be ruined!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> She finally got with some of them.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> i did not no what to say because i thought stalker.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> WHateer you do, DON'T sneak around with the guy.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> If he's your best guy friend and he has a life other than you = *girlfriend*, don't make problems!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Marriage is security, why u r insecure?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> I don't know, but if I ever find this stupid woodchuck I am gonna kick its @$$!!!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> there are always exceptions, but personality for me
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> you may be bi....... how old are you?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> act like u don't want him.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> and she gotta be dead gorgeous.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> Um.... yes, i think thats why ur name is crazy chic.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> If she isn't hot enough for his friends to meet her, he definitely isn't going to marry her!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> Oh ..see that must be what it is..I have too many wants.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> If the kids are truly the only reason why u are still with that person.... RUN LIKE HELL!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yes there are, maybe you are just to demanding and unrealistic.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> but it kind of depends if you bleed when your cherry pops.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> a lady in the street and a freak in the bed.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Smile no matter what you do.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> I think they just do it to piss us off, and it works!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> unless you have also had an affair with a married man.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> And whatever you do, DON'T use a pump.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> just be there for the child(ren)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> but its a little bit of a turn on if he's secretive and likes to try new thing's.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> she try to confrot me and just make me fell good

<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> so why not more than one wife at a time.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> But in my opinion, you did everything in a right way girl!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> i would honestly think that the man was a pervert.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> 26 is old enough to lose your virginity and sex is a GREAT experiance!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> I WOULDN'T DATE MID EASTERN GUYS.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> I see nothing wrong with it!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> it hurts some girls, and sometimes it doesn't.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> hey hun E mail me at babygurlmuchlove@yahoo.com!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> One date didn't cut it for me!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> It is only too long if YOU think it is too long.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> Tell her to dump him and run away as fast as possible.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> just say no,say mabie next time
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> If he is allowed to move on then why can't you?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> man u krazy i wouldnt want dat jurk back.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> Some guy like it others don't.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> but we have talked about it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> BUT HEY IF YOU LIKE THE SAME GENDER THATS YOU.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> men are just so sex obsesed, they think women are too... no worries, and good luck!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Especially when that guy found what he's looking for a girl to that other girl.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> TALK TO HIM AND MAYBE HE WILL CHANGE!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> youcan kiss on the cheek but that is it
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Dump him, theres lots of guys who you could kick it with.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> and plus you should have told him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> No its not mean to say no to someone.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> a girl that is 24/7 available for him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> are you sure hes not just after your body because you are young looking?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> people can fall in love at any age right?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> i don't think is a good idea....
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> well kami i know this girl who fom germany if your a girl
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> I Need Love by LL Cool J, 21 Questions by 50 Cent, I Need a Girl By P.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> i ithink its all about eye contact and when they look at you its a way
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> Wait til u are money wise ready.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> love is a feeling sex is an action
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> it releases the blood built up in ur skin.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> what kind of sensitive r u talking about?
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_25> you got an express ticket to hell.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> (just kiding), that girl is your girl just go and take her!
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_45> Im not sure what to do
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_10> MORE SOME MONTHS(FOUR TIMES YESTERDAY) SOME LESS ONCE IN DECEMBER
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> but of course, remember cuts, bacteria, viruses can go right in it....and there yah go...STD!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Ok wait heres another one go get her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> tell both of them that u made an accident and see their reaction but do it separatly
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> THIS WAS SUPPOSE TO BE FUN?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> give him time to digest that info, it is alot to comprehend, he should come around...DO NOT PRESSURE HIM!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> iv always wondered about this one.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Obviously there are no guarantees; even waiting until marriage doesn't mean happily ever after.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> SISTER .. not her girl .. then why a girl should be jealous of her?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> masturbating is normal not doing is not normal
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> well their is on thing the way they talk
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_30> tell him, if you really like him.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> (Unless they pick the person) Second, don't focus so much on love.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> AND THAT IN 5 YEARS I HAVEN'T GONE A DAY WITHOUT THINKING OF HER.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> well just b/c personality is on top of the list doesnt mean we dont consider looks at all.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> : )  It works with my own three children.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> no not really, but it kinda sounds gay like life partner or somthing
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Unless you don't want a relationship.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> most girls in preteens and teens have feelings like that.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> It was beautiful and I didn't have to spend alot of money on flowers because they were already there.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> So then I have to wait to reply.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> i'd lie if i look 4 fun coz i don't know if she telling the truth either.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> oh yah i dont have 2 girlfriends
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> I do think 4-6 are reasonable good...too many may make it look like mobile phone keypad :)
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> young women date older guys alot .
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> (because he may already have them)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Joe asks about the ex's current boyfriend, the ex says hes a great guy just not available right there.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Then he gets mad at me for moving on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Send me a message and I'll flirt with you ;)
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> Good luck, I hope this gets you started!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just use things that make you happy in your wedding.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> u can do that by taking the first step, I mean asking her out.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> If you know a girl like that, don't try to push her romantically.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> ask questions that don't tell people that u might be pvrtd
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> I did not love the guy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> Just make that week all about her.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> He loves me alot, or so he claims and wants me to still be around.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> go to the movies and see Stay Alive
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> i love my bf but my parents don't believe me HELP any answers will be accepted
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> u can definitely get such a man.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> I taught him a new word for himself too.......k*nky!!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> penis pump dont use it all the time
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> TELL HIM YOU VOTED FOR BUSH.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> WE'RE KNOWN AS 'GROWERS NOT SHOWERS.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> When a guy picks his nose or has dirty fingernails... my 2 BIGGEST turnoffs!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Just some but I prefer girls with some meat on them.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> yeah..kinda..i have blonde hair that's down to my shoulders and i have side bangs.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> it didnt hurt really bad for me.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> smash the computer and kick his butt to the curb.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> and the second day she said something a little stupid and i told her: you are so stupid!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> There is this guy I like, who doesn't answer my e-mails or anything!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> My guess is you like both of them.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> in fact, i didn't really give you any advice come to think of it.......
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Give her her space and do what she wants
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> do what is in your heart.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> stand outside and shout 'I want an email address...now!!!'
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> but before that big commitment i have to experiment my choices.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> I've always wondered and most men are obcessed about size.I want the truth!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> I moved on and is very happy now with my new family!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> i could type for hours but have to go and do some work!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> My love is not for sale...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> dbl wahmy..as a female would that be something that would turn u off?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> He claims if he was prowling that he would dump me first b/c he couldnt deal w 2 girls.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> But once that person lost your trust, then don't trust 'em no more.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> tell him you're a lesbian and you dig girls.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> certainly not, their baby is the fruit of their labor of love
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> it makes it more affective that way.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> don't bother with all this stuff until you are twenty five.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> Different strokes for differrent folks, they say!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_20> first and foremost ... DID THE PARENTS WARN U OR SOMETHING ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> 13 i don gave it to her raw
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_25> love doen't come fast or slow.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> lost my number,can i get yours!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> I wuld want her 2 b happy.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> all kinda ways get creative just make sure it is cool with her first ;))
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> and this is exactly why i dont recommend sex out of marriage.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> lol  keep him dangling for a while....weeks!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> BUT SHE DONT HAVE THE GUMPTIOPN TO MAKE ME UNTIRED ENOUGH FO HAVE IT.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Hey if you want to stay close to  them as a friend do it.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_20> yES, DEFINETLY i WOULD BE WORRIED.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Kissing her neck is a little too friendly.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> Its too bad that you got to beg.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> IF YOU'RE NOT IN A RELATIONSHIP THERE'S NOTHING WRONG W/ EXPLORING ALL OPTIONS.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> If you decide to give him a second chance...get a pre-nup that specificly states...if he cheats...you get everything!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> only if you learn to spell
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Yeah, it's a really sad story though.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I don't believe that most women really say that.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> Maybe think about what turns you on!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> There are men out there who like larger women.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> no it wasn't wrong  give him credit  Ed Mcmahon once said you can't win if you don't enter
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> i'd say first get really close give him sighns.
<NbChars_40> <LevSim_30> I don't think I can live anymore.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> yes, cuz in the bible premaritail sex is bad!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> Why don't you just try to be patient?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> At that age my hubby didn't have much of a sex drive either...it does happen...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> i dont know how much it costs.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> make sure you love her and then just go for it...remember...women like romance!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Because if you say the wrong thing then you are not feeling that way about them.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> What turns we off is when they think they can have any girl they want, it bugs so much!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Her love and affections should be forever cherrished and saved for one man for life!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Obviously she's a lucky girl to have a man who actually cares about Her happieness with them.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Change your phone number..that'll stop him for sure...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> I think for most men its during.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Concentrate on all the things that bring you joy - NOT HIM.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> I left her; being with a jealous person is no way to live
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> my fiancee came home one day and told me that he cheated on me a week ago.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> ok stop leaving rude comments on my questions.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> its 3 nice heart nice body  nice thinking
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> but thatz juzt me other  females have thier own feelings n thoughts  were all diff
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> shew is blind, they arent soul mates; he is a liar and a cheater.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> Thank God she does too, it means she loves you!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> you know what, if she's shallow enough to be concerned with stuff like that then who needs her.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> If thats what your asking, then yes Its very normal
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> Is there any advice on this?...
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> r u not happy with a distant companion or did that not seem to be enough.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> that is the best advice i can give you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> he dribbles... he shoots... he scores... 2 points...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> Wait a minute, what's the hurry!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> IT WOULD BE BETTER IF U LIVE SEPARATELY FROM UR IN-LAWS IF IT IS AFFORDABLE
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> AND IF YOUR THERE BECAUSE OF LOVE THEN GET SOME COUNSULING .AND WORK IT OUT .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> I would do anything she like!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> SO WHY DO YOU MEN CHEAT??
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> all i look for in a guy is a partnership.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> He has a girl, I have a boyfriend.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> say goodbye and mean it..you deserve better.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> i think that he shouldnt just ask unless he knows its what ur in2.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> what that song by toni baxton:HE WASN'T MAN ENOUGH  girl i agree with you!!!!!!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO FIND YOURSELF.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> But i was so stupid and told him 2 stop calling me, so he did.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> I think I see why she broke up with you......
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> I don't care if she is stupid or vein as long as she's hot I'm happy.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> there are always nice girls there.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Some want a dork the size of a fire hose and some don't.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> 1. you should have given him the rejection hotline!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> If other people dont like it then look the other way!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> not just from getting a blow job.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Well... first it depends on if yo are trying to be serious now or wait til later.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> but i'd probably never really wear the glasses..they are cute though.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_40> go read it and find out
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> I want him so badly I can taste it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> I waited 4 years while my sister on the other hand waited 9 months
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> Who likes anyone who is not real?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> i love my bf and i know he loves me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Is it something that you are not doing?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> yes i wud buh depends where he moves to go...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> start to pull your head back and end it with a regular kiss it closes the deal
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> what would the perfect guy be like?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> were the guys in school who didnt get all the girls .
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> My boyfriend uses primatene mist,an otc inhaler  hope this helps:)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Do you know anybody he knows?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> im not blond and every boy is like in luv wit me
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> i don't think race should matter.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> well, have you talked to him about it?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> and why would she want a man that cheated on his wife.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I want to remain friends with both of you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> and we are as much in love now as we were 17 years ago...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> make her feel like she is the sexiest woman alive... candle light!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> The woman I would spend the rest of my life with.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> Don't be foolish to sell yourself cheap & sleep around, too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> not too fat not too thin!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> GOD WANTS LOVE TO BE FOR MAN AND WOMEN ONLY.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> i like to spoil my man.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Sometimes, honesty is best........dont wait....tell her you were waiting.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> U must be ugly to advertise here .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> She is his Sister .. excuse me ..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> i know how painful it can be.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Too many women it seems hate to see their husbands or boyfriends get close to his sisters.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> if i were you i'd be really worried.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> If you have to ask you have bigger problems then finding a lady friend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> me too i go one day and need it
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> NO.... NOT INLESS SHE IS REALY CLOSE TO YOUR FAMILY.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_20> hmmmm average for some but not for others.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> HE SHOULD NOT BE FLIRTING WITH ANYONE BUT YOU!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> I mean almost as cute as me
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU HEARD ABOUT HIM BUT HE IS A P-I-M-P....
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> And he likes this girl, and doesn't want it to be a hit and run.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> and this is the honest truth.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Everytime im around her i feel like shes eye'ing me and sneaking in cheap touches.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> But it depends if u believe in love at first sight?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> if your husband is yes that is not fair
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> some girls do and some dont though.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> my new boyfriend just got a female roommate and I don't like it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Well ur first mistake was allowing him to have sex with you even though u werent together anymore.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> ithink girls do it because she want to be a big girl and not with a young boy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> well, you  kind of answered your own question!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> THEY ARE NOT THAT IMPORTANT TO A LOT OF GUYS.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> If yes, then did you get to know someone there??
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> just take it as it comes.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> just always think the consequences you will face after!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> what kind of questions can i ask.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> then you have girls that try and warp guys to do what they want.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> yea it hurts cuz were tight but it also feels good.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> im a guy, so id assume ive got a pretty good idea.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I just don't know what to do.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> ARE YOU BUYING (GIVING HIM MONEY) HIS LOVE?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> stay with your husband if u leave him u might leave the other
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> You cannot make a man ask you to marry him!!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> How about you keep having sex with him and saying i love you?Maybe that'll work?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> but i dont know what to say.I dont really like him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> If you live your life worrying about what she or anyone else thinks, you wont be happy.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> When you get back (dont drink and drive)have great sex with her and tell how much you love her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> if there is a struggle then try counciling.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> SO I just smiled and then frowned again and walked away.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Of course it's up to you!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> The lesson here is: KEEP YOUR DAMN NOSE OUT OF OTHER PEOPLE'S MARRIAGES.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> so why do you think that is.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> Brown, that looks like coffee with cream in it, or Green
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_10> NEXT TIME MAKE HIM SWEAR ON HIS OWN LIFE!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> guys want girls with looks and a hot body.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Maybe ur looking in the wrong places.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> he will make like a porn star and pull out!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> but again if this is what the two of you decide on then it is right for you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> in what part u became selfish?
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_45> to be a flirt you have to flirt first.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> Well...i have a friend...and hes just exactly what i love!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> it how depends on what he likes
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> If there was no bad there would be no good.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> don't do it, cuz you might break up with her, and she migh tnot be your love.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> first of all i want to assure you that god will not get offended.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> if you feel that it isn't right then don't try to find excuses to do it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> HE JUST STUPID AND SOUNDS LIKE HE USED YOU.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> im not pregnit but i understand!!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> put your ad on the personals....it really works
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> iam 5feet and 9inches tall, so she should be just a half inch shorter.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> and now i miss him a lot and want him back.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Ever meet that guy who only dates girls with over DD cups?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> I think that guy just thought you were pretty, or something.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> he might not think so, though and is looking for some other.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> be a flirt but not to much and where your hair down just look cute and available
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> just take ur time give him the best answer
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> ok i herd this from a friend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> please do everyone a favor- don't have any kids....you need to access why you are even married??
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> no need for u think too much about what you have to do.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> MAybe later she want guys if want or maybe not, but still she would do that anyway!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> so yea hit me up at da address i jus gave!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> i need a good scary movie for a date with a beautiful woman.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> he said nothing so i took it as a yes.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> just tell him to call you after school so that you can talk about it.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> what if she doesnt like me?
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_25> if you're straight, gay, or bi, it's up to you.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> Well i feel nowadays its not as big of a deal.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> I totally agree with you, I'm so tired of seeing those questions on here!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> u guys were still sharing that bond even after you broke up.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> JUST TALK 2 HER THEN ONCE U START TALKIN ASKHER IF SHE WANTS 2 GO OUT SUMTIME!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> I met my nice guy thru a friend.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> BESIDES, YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT..YOUR A BIT BELOW AVERAGE IN SIZE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> sounds like your already doing it!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> girl you are so right i am confused myself about this guy at school!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> i jack off a lot does it harm the chances of having a baby
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> i can't associate with anyone without him having issues.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> it's keeping it, when she realizes how stupid she could've just been.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> P Diddy I'll Be Missing You
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> IM GUESSING U WERE GROWING UP WITHOUT UR FATHER.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Sh!t I just say I had sex with the guy.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> Sweetie, I don't really know what to tell you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> you know why the bride smiles as she walks down the aisle, don't you?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> If you have to lie, then it is not worth going.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> but remember if your friends don't like him, there might be a good reason behind it.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> feel the beauty of rain,streets, winds etc.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> if you really like him, go for it!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> beutiful body, good eyes,face,slim but hot body, some naughty movements
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> i got so upset i left and hadnt been back since.it has been 2 weeks.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Dont ever ask him questions that can not be given a satisfactory answer like... Am I fat?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> If she is a good girl, No she will wait until her wedding day!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> screw it....go gay all the way
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> hell no it's just not a good way to start your life.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> either way is coo but an aggresive female is a good thang.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> depends on who you're trying to screw
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> how do you feel about it?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> i think your dream is just discouraging you.follow your feelings!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> who better to ask then a truman?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> it really depends on the guy - what kind of a person is he, is he nice, est.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> I like girls some where in between.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Don't get me wrong I do love to suck on the breast.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> if it hurt u, u should let him know.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> well as an old fashion male.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> it depends some blonds r not attrive but  not because of the hair.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> both her legs has polio attack.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> If not, then Im sure there are other reasons that they have.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Also my brother always says I'm lying but I'm not.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> Think..Ding-Dong... no one wants someone boring.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> or if you did then that would force you to get married!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> I told the guy how I felt...and to my surprise...he felt the same way!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> then you are dating him for the wrong reason.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> don't you know any women in person who can do that?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> that part bout you marry to be faithfull to ur husband is a whole load of crap.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> yes...especially if you've done it with the wrong guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> What and how do I tell her?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> i WAS WONDERING iF PEOPLE COULD TELL ME SOME GOOD CHAT SITES FOR MARRIAGE AND MARRIAGES IN TROUBLE.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> I would have to say...bad teeth.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> Same happpened to me, I love my honey but the dream was so much better than reality!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> but make sure he is the one or u could be sorry
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> for most of the people i know, the right people seem to come along when you're not actually looking.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Pearl Harbor She gets the best of both worlds in that movie!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> and tell him if he don't them the relationship is not going any where.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> I sense someone has got a foot fetish!=/
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> 2nd time is highly better, and then, it just becomes perfect.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> R you giving her time, emotional touch etc.?
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> Thats rich coming from a girl!!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> She doesn't want to have sex with you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> Get a life and some sense in you b4 somebody has to knock it into your silly white ass.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> keep lookin at him move alittle and look again
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> LOL trust me a girl and aguy will sooner or later have feelings feelings of jus being just friends
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> and now he wants to marry you.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> I don't like girls like Paris Hilton - way too bony.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> He shouldn't but he is, and ya have to deal with that.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> If u think of him/her like ATM (24/7)you are in love.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> LOL-as long as it don't cause any trouble with her or the family!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> nope, get some one to try it with who knows how to do it
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> leaving messages and saying he is sorry.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> And even now, I will not insert anything but my hubbys pen-is.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Some females use chats because they can not be seen .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> He could have just kept his mouth shut forever!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> DOES SHE APPEAR HAPPY OR LIKE SOMEONE JUST RAN OVER HER DOG.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> it depends, try and u'll see.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> cause i have a friend that just turns me on
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> What is it that you really want your lover to do for you?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> i dont run so bring it on..lol
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> And they can't really have something bad to say about everyone they know.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> look around she might be there
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_35> dont beat his as$ talk to him if that does'nt work beat his as$!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> If you are not rich .. use your brains.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> but i'm a mom so i'ts hard to trust just anyone.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> you don't think of anything else but them
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> No for most girls, but some do.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_10> THEY ENDED UP MARRIED LASTED 3 YEARS NOW DIVORCED.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> The grass ain't greener on the other side!!!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_5> YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK SECRETLY THEY ARE GETTING PAID BECAUSE I THINK THAT ITS THEIR JOB
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> Once in a while, though, you find one of those keepsake guys.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_10> JUST FORGET ABOUT IT ...OBVIOUSLY HES NOT ON UR LEVEL
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> Yes, don't worry about what others think.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> If he is someone that you trust, why not?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> i go home to vacation every year to see him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> WOW that was alot to take in and read.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Be creative.........have a ball.........ok have a jar instead.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> because everyone need to be happy cause you only have one life.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> well the biggest problem with this is the fact that your dream guy, is just that a DREAM!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> THAT WOULD BE THE ONLY CATCH.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> green and hazel are my faves
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> but when i went out the stuff hit the fan.

<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> and gurls ...does it hurt the first time?
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_35> Things will never be the same if yall date.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_10> YUO LET HIM KNOW HOW YOU LIKE HIM DON'T LEAD HIM ON
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> anywho.com it works for real white pages is kinda lame
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> Or you do not know what Love really is...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> you have to wait for them to heal.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> It didn't for me but i always used tampons so i don't know if thats why or not.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> mmm, I thought people got married for better or for worse.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> seriously get horny but women r so unavailable it seems
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Ian is a blonde and 13 year old teen!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> make alot of friends, do alot of things, keep yourself busy to what can benefit you.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> be grateful you even have a best friend.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> maybe you should tell her that you may not feel the same as her.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> ya need a footjob or something?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> Give your winning ways a chance.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Update:   Tell her Dr. Phil always says If they'll cheat WITH you, they'll cheat ON you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> and from your post i think you are to young to be in love like this.

<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> I am way too nervous to ask him if he does like me or not!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> YOU KNOW WHAT EACH OTHER ARE GOING TO SAY BEFORE THEY SAY IT.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> hes single rite now and hes really cvute.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> hell yeah i have a problem with that
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> just kidding =) a lot, i guess.

<NbChars_55> <LevSim_20> Best of luck to you...you can do it!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> if you know what i mean.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> if not then reapeat all these steps again!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> It's not at all illegal..it's just dating...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> If you love your wife you should not lie to her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> and lets face it most guys claim to love gals n treat them nice as an investment for sex.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> Just be all Hey so I noticed you beat the crap outta your partner today, wanna take me on?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Oh yeah if that doesn't work shave your balls and buy some good porn.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> If she doesn't she's not interested in being friends anymore.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> am i just being over emotional or is he controlling and i should do something.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Yes you should if you really like this guy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> if you honestly feel all of the above, that is love!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> whatevr as long as its sex
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you think she is going to get mad, she's not worth it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> ok first get a job and make your own money for your own house.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> They can't even drive a car!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> But who has eyes that big?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> the guy im telling saw his ex girlfriend holding hands with other guy...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> hey dude most of those girls are called lesbians.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> no,I say think about it really hard.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> you will know, trust me, she will give you signs
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> oh man i am so nervouse.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> not yet, settle the divorce first.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> Some women climax and some don't.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> if you realy like him go for it but remember dont fall to hard the move could hurt.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> Then i haven`t spoke to her for few days and you know what?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> cool.. .what do u wanna talk about?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> 5th grade is too young to learn about that!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> but still take child support of course and the courts cant do a thing realistically.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> will get you much better results, try it!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> Winter just makes your dress dirty.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> And lots of new friends to have fun with!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> if you leave her alone, she will quit coming around.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Tell her how much you love and miss her and can't wait to see her again.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> It hurts me that I can't be the girl he want.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> or she may just be teasing you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> If he is OK - Of course!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_10> SO LEAVE IF YOUR THERE FOR YOUR CHILDEREN .
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> i want to find a good women from around here
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i usually wear sweat pants when i am just hanging around.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> it's not like they're gonna completely ignore each other or anything.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> I don't think it has 2 do w/ sex more like who fell harder for who
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> Both of these couples have been together over 10 years and are just now getting married!)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> Get him drunk and see what he is like.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> You've just gotta tell him straight up it was a mistake.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> yes and no it depends how long you two have been together to begin with.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> I would try to move on & get over it.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> when u r in love and alone with your love
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> of course if they dont have any feelings for eachotehr adn they get along it is.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> i have a feeling my girl friend will be really mad.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> keep looking in different places, there are decent, fun, women out there...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> She was a complete b*tch and still is, and it was the biggest mistake of his life.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Dont do that please cos GOD hates that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> No, wait unil you are married??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> You would never dream about spending your life with anyone else.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> I WILL BE USING IT AT MY WEDDING.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> maybe u'll feel nervous infront of them but when u r alone u can't stop thinking abt them!
<NbChars_295> <LevSim_5> 6-7 IS ABOVE & 7+IS HUGE!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> screw thm so ther not so jealous
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> there is no such thing i would have it every 5 min if i could
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Whats the one percenct thats missing?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Does he like me or not?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> leave her alon and give her some time
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> someone told me once that is you even have to ask if they're cheating then they probably are.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> that sounded mean, i didn't mean it like that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_5> 4.TAKE YOUR TIME AND MAKE HER COMFORTABLE
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> my problem is i don't have a big penus( about 5in erected).. and i only last about 4-6 min.
<NbChars_280> <LevSim_20> Don't snort, get too tipsy, or smoke too much.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> that is what you are asking about.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> what kind of a question is that!?!?!?!?!?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> you do not need to explain anything to him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> you should wait until you're sure.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> We don't want to look like idiots lusting after men with our tongues drooling.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> Take your time, find the right person, get married and u can have sex all day!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> It doesn't really mean either of those, it means like going out on a date or just hanging out!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Tell them to shut up and mind their own business!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> she'll sometimes be mean to you
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> yes of course, ppl do this all the time now (becuz of HIV/AIDS) but most are to selfish too
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> just be yourself and dont worry .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> if she smiles and laughs a lot w/ you, thats a good sign to make your move!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> He wants to have is cake and eat it too...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> Just b/c she gave you head doesn't mean that she should be trusted.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> Air Supply - All Out of Love Album
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> I guess the longing to be love the way you love that person
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> you cant make him love you nor should you try.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> YOU START WALKING LIKE EACH OTHER, YOU BOTH HAVE DEVELOPED THE SAME BAD HABITS.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> CHEATING ONLY MAKES THINGS WORSE IN THE END.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> the reson there aint many is most ladies don't go for the nice guy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> search and you dind the way
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Let her be lesbian if she feel like it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> I,VE CARRIED THE WEIGHT OF BILLS,KIDS CARE, ETC., FOR YEARS AND I,M FED UP.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> 'course, if you're talkin about in bed..  well, that depends on what she's like.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> that guy gonna have a good laugh!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> do u really want to do that!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> So why the hell am i with him?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> YES  Hope I answered your question.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Because i have not really meet people of diferent races.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> If he's not, then dump him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> She shouldn't be bothering with a married man, because it's WRONG.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> ya right here are you a sweet guy if you are email me serbgirl90@yahoo.com and we can chat
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> wear protection, try to make her feel as comfortable as possible.. and take it extremely slow.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> no love is for all, no matter what sex they are
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> PEOPLE LIE IN REAL LIFE YOU KNOW THEY WILL LIE BEHIND A COMPUTER SCREEN.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> just 2, my wife and my best friend.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> (its really what is inside that ultimately counts)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> i am on birth control and my bf is not pushing me whatso ever.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Men are a strange bunch and remember that most men will not tell you thier with someone.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> and maybe the timing just wasn't right you'd invite her to do something and she really was busy.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> down there if you get my drift.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> I don't think there should be a catch!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> As far as tips go, I have no idea!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> You cheated on HIM and YOU don't trust HIM?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> I see strange #s on his phone all the time but says it's work related.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> Maybe... if they're childhood friends, Like sandbox buddies who grew up with each other from preschool.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> beleive me i fell in love with an over weight person.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_45> if you are talking a jealous bf/gf, run!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> i agree with angelpop993 and butterballs!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> If you just are horney, well, you are just human.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> I WANT IT ALL THE TIME.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Another young man said to him, Oh, don't do it!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> thats prolly all u can do right now!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> but dont expect things will be smooth.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> How about we hook up later on for lunch?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> U shouldn't have to do anything,as long as u r good to her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> If you have sex before marriage, why get married?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> U CAN LOOK 4 HIM ONLINE AND MANY OTHER PLACES
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> P.S : Dont fall for a girl.. let girls fall for you!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> yes  you are flirting with your mom
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> I can't though because I don't love him and im not goin to lie.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> it was fun and i would do it again!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> i'm not sure anyone will understand what your saying because ur english is too broken.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> women like responsible guys and u walking around with yours screams responsible.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> Damn baby, I wanna date you...LOL.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> WOW, look at the answers of one of the young boys...too funny!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> SIT THEM DOWN AND TALK TO THEM
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> go to the park and barbeque or play go to the zoo.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> I know you're not coercing the woman, but are you sure you're not messing with her head?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> but dont tell nobody but u should be with someone your own age cause u could get caught.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> You're not dumb, mind you, he's a predator.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Don't ask me - ask God
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> love is wat girls wish for and is sex wat guys wish for
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> you shoudl go for someone who will like you for you....:)
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> its to hard to explain love!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> anything i want i'll work for it.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_10> IF 2 CLICK ITS OK USE PROTECTION
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> He's a nice guy, but very annoying.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> they think they can get away with anthing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> C'mon be serious boys just dont share rooms with their friends...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> You are female, she is female!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> wow you waited this long, why start now ?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> No but it ok to forgive him and her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> i honestly think really big breats are kinda ugly.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> Just go and ask him out.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> Try to keep things open between your family and your guy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> I'm somewhat outgoing, she and I look just alike, I'm not a nerd...I don't get it!!!!!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> I love him and he loves me...What should I do???
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Thye latest I heard .. is  .. get married under water .. that will be VERY different.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> i think women just don't admit it as readily as men do.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> The right one will come dont worry
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> i'm not looking to see how his pant bulge.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> And i  would just say good bye for good.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> you love both with all your heart.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> yeah right... thanks to viagra... lol...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> have a lot of guys as friends and date them.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> There are a lot of good guys out there.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> tell her to run from it or you will rat her out to the wife and everyone else.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> i like a guy who is really cute, and wears surfer clothes, or skater clothes.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> Sigh not a whole lot of help I guess, I am just a girl :P
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> Don't worry so much, be happy being single.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> when u think of just being with them.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> that can always make it worse.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> so...i'd go with the first one if i were you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> it can produce more muscle... and you will sweating!!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> be sure that he wont do it again.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> You didn't say if they were friends or not.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_15> IF HE'S NOT HAPPY WITH YOU ANYMORE THEN LET HIM GO.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> there are many of us out there, just look for the garter sticking out from her suit skirt
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_95> If your worried about it, use some lube.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> BUT ME PERSONALY DO NOT LIKE THE FACT WOMEN LIKE WOMEN AND MEN LIKE MEN IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> and the other thing is it really happens to find ur life partner around the globe?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> you at least want her to know
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> be her friend and help her regain trust in men, you, and love.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> and the average size is not 6-8 inches.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> nooooooooooooo i love him he is soo cool!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> IS THERE HOPE OR AM I JUST OUT OF LUCK?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> the man gets both a wife and a mistress.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> THAT'S VERY HARD BUT IF YOUR DOUBTING IT A LITTLE THEN MAYBE YOU DON'T REALLY LOVE HER.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> No , not at all .
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> and if she dont like you than so what .
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> everyone is doing it....but like sumone b4 me said why get married if u gonna have sex outside it?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> even if you dont have someone around who can see it, you are a worthwhile, important person.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> She probably doesn't think she's that hot.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Wouldn't that be like committing suicide twice?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Life works in mysterious ways, dude!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Just comb ( not to hard tho) across it.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> does it really matter we all bleed red
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> when the first and last thought on your mind involves that specialomeone, you know ur in love!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> God forbid I find somebody I want!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> its perfectly fine to wait, whatever is best for you!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> not complain, end the affair and move on with life
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> i think its almost good to try things before you get married.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_10> IS THEIR ANYONE OUT THEIR IN THE DETROIT AREA WHO IS LOOKING FOR A COMPATIABLE FRIEND TO THE END.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> um, if your asking this question you are not old enough to be doing anything, let alone kissing
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> i love talking to new people.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> u can have both.. if u're lucky enough!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Real men dont cheat all men dont cheat, players are immature and some day be sad little men!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> i guess they either just want your attention or they just dont have nothing else to do.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_35> check it out on the web.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> well that is something you gotta sit and talk to her about.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> he has dark, almost black hair and he either spikes it or shaves it bald.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Get a man who IS ready.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> I mean from the attitude I saw, ugh!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Don't talk to guys you know, except to sayhi.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> that didnt matter cuz if u love n respect him u would jus do it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> if they know u want them there is no challenge for them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> I THINK HE IS SICK GUY .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> Come back later, chat, and kid around a little more, then walk away.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> i came to see there are natural remedies like garlics nd other like leek leaves.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> if he is smiling, you might be the person who he likes.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> they always wonder what he's thinking about!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Would you be a bad person to want better?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> need to be scary, but not MEGA scary
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> Just don't have sex with her until you get married.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> we like it when you just do it sometimes
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Do married women really like to cheat on there husbands?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> jest say  Hey I think your realy nice but i just dont want to be a couple
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> they r sincere when they say size does not matter.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> if he thinks i'm cheating he takes the cell phone from me until he's ready to give it back.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> ps.marriage is'nt always about love as it is commitment!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> To all guys: Look at the PERSONALITY, and NOT just the LOOKS!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> i wish to know why myself.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Thanks for your help, Yahoo Community!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> talk with her a little everyday.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> Too large and too small aren't good.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> so i go pick her up with her kids all 7 of them need i say more?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> YOU CANNOT MAKE SOMEONE LIKE YOU.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> she obviously has a thing for you, and she probably will not admit it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Tell her that a guy can't do it 10 times a day with out dier consequences.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> ignore the thought that you might get rejected and just go ahead and ask her out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Then, imagine spending the rest of your life with him/her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> if not the grocery store late at night not too late though.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> Ever meet that guy who just really likes cleavage?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Call & talk to him, though.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> OK GUYS WHAT WOULD U DESCRIBE AS A PERFECT GIRL??
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> ya what do you mean girls just like a guy thats there self and sweet and does not cheat
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> the world needs more girls like you.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> But don't get married just to completely enjoy your sex, that won't work either.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> You cant choose who will you love!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> youre just attracted to weird people.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Face it head on with your eye open!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Ok I'm getting chills......I so wanna know if this works!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> you will get over it eventualy
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Don't give him any, and see if he still says it.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_20> I think I would go crazy
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> i love girls but i still look at guys and am like damn!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> sign up at yahoo.com for an e-mail.duh.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> An 80 year old man could date a 15 year old girl & not get in trouble.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> last time i did this, i was 14 -- no, wait.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Yes cuz i would fell wrong.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> It really doesnt hurt but it really sucks the first time.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Best of luck to you,   Rascal
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> me either we need to hook up
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> If it was me, (I am a girl) I would not make love till I was 27.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT HE LOVES YOU, HE DON'T PAY RENT BUT REFERS TO LIVE ON SOMEONE ELSE.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> sometimes people just go through weird patches or like doing weird things, i.e.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> If you desperatly want a guy, then let him come to you, dont let ur self go to him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> If she did then she wouldn't be my girlfriend!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> I'D WAIT UNTIL HELL FREEZES OVER.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> so i should say, just for for it.u ll never know unless u try
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> yes, but it's gross,i usally don't.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> There is just a few differences... we all want love right?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> is it the right time to have sex or should we wait?
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_20> Sex Pistols Anarchy in the UK
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> It is normal for me to ask you -What yo name is?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> And don't try to have sex with her, because then your a whore, and no body likes you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Do you know what it means to BE married?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> u think of both chose the best who care u lot or love u lot
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> i just dont wanna keep living my life like a hermet.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> Crack jokes and make her laugh.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> it is fun and exciteing, but don't rush it, it is so much better, when you are both ready.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_35> how do i get back to him
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> I think you need to run!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Isn't it just her opinion that counts?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you don't she will co*k block you in every other relationship you try to start.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> You should give him some space or just ask him and he might tell u.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> he has a problem if i stay at my moms house too long even.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Why would he get a female roommate?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> If you don't fuck me, feed me, or pay my bills......Go fuck yourself!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> If you want to leave then leave!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Sounds like you just gonna have to be down right dirty with her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> But please keep me out of this.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> bright skin...tall...legs boobs and ass are imporatant parts of a woman!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> But I found that you just can't make it,   if your not in love.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> i am guessing, honest, pretty, semi-smart ( not smarter than them).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> If you dont feel comfortable with him b/c he's a different race, I wouldn't give it a shot.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> But I dont mind so much now because we have discoverd that it acctually prevents cramping pains.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> I don`t consider myself sensitive but if I have some sensibility i`m covering it so I won`t get hurt
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> it wil come out any way it's up to you when and how.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> It sounds like she just really likes this boyfriend.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> Don't get CAUGHT in any lies.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> Real girls don't care how large it is.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> a adverage girl because shes real she dosent have to be fake to be pretty
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> but later they realise that the bigger it is, the more pain they have to bear.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> saudi women are in their vails
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> As im sure he would point out if he were the one who had.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> if ur love is true, nothing else matters.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> hopefully the someone you love also is someone who loves you....thats the only way you can stay with anyone
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> ALL WOMEN LIE in there profiles
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> I see nothing wrong in it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> i dont agree w/ it,but guys want the looks;2 be honest
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> puppy fashion  allows for the greatest mutual climax
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> No way dude, it's totally cool that you and your mom make out!!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> from a guys point of view i wouldnt wana marry a non-virgin.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> he has the best of both worlds.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Click the link below and you can look it up for your self, ages, etc.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> After all, a girl's got to eat.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> it's human nature to want what you can't have.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> If she's that jealous of you, is she that good a friend?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> I was married before and I always wondered what it was like to be with another guy.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> if that guy says no, it'll be his loss.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Do this little girly thing, girls like it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> And take your caps lock off.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> But now he has become vocal that if I date at all it should be her.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Oh just tell him... What could you lose?
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_40> only if you are over 21
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Ask him what's your quarantee that this wont happend.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> i don't know but that hot!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Women get torn between two people also, but you have an obligation to your wife and your CHILDREN!!!
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_50> who do u love more - boyfriend or bestfriend?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> forget about her and find somebody else¡¡¡
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> it's easier for a girl to love, because thats what the stereotypical girl is like.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> IF SHE WONT GO OUT WITH U MOVE ON..DONT BOTHER..IM SURE YOU ARE A GREAT GUY
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> how about the ring its not so scary
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> I mean I love him so much and yet I still feel lonli.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> but it is okay to start and then finalize the divorce.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_25> I can succesfully say No you can't.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> the next thing would be and ipod.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> Dont tell people unless your gonna explain what it means
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> I dont live too far from Springfield

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> i don't care if he wanted to be with his friends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> see she thinks he will leave some day his wife for her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> It doesn't really matter, does it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> He sees the girl from taco bell and she is eyeing him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> I LOVE A SEMI LARGER WOMAN.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> (or if they haven't where would they like to go?)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> i rather be a mad man and eat food with pigs than to become a gay.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> I just don't feel comfortable sticking foreign stuff in there.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> it's fine what ever makes someone happy
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> How about the Four Tops, Greatest Hits.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> when men are obnoxious, or when they burp
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> women, cuz women love more than men.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> call him up and tell him to come over so yall can have sex
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> stand by her and stand up for her!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> if u dont like them, dont read them.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> that 's where I met my last a**hole ex-boyfriend!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> It is not that guy's are complicated.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> cause they don't know what they are doing
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> If you guys dont live together, ARE YOU SURE HE IS REALLY WORKING!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> I STILL LOVE HER AND I AM WILLING TO FORGET ABOUT THE PAST.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> i dont know many thugs that ask girls out online.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> i have had many females ask me out, and look at me in that way.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> my grandpa and grandma dont have sex..but they seem to be doing fine.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I just dont know what to do.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> if hes never been faithful why waste your time and life.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I just assumed you were an angel
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> thats a toughy... i have no clue but i know how you feel...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> no dont tell them or they'll start acting stupid
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> If you just want to be friends, tell him that.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> He then may feel it's ok to go hang with other girls.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> MOST MEN LIKE BIG BREAST WERE BREAST FED.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> sex is when you are ready for more in your realtionship
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> Have you ever heard, some friends are for seasons, some are for reasons and some are for life.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Don't tell him it might get screwed up.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> stop looking and you'll find her.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> There are some guys that do actually like heavy women.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Dont be afraid to say  No duh!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> You are ok. Kind of a boring face though.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> he also may now i like him but i don't now how to tell him.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> oh my gosh its a girl.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Depends on how far your willing to go!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> is called one night in hell i think or somthing like that.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> sometimes sex is just that sex!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> ****I really love this boy as well
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> Hope you find him, and I hope you get back together wiht him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> if she really loves you then just say you love her and she will say it back.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Will r sex life b normal?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> ....Or should there be a catch?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> a friend in need is a friend indeed, you know.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> I would if thats wat she wants.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> dont try to meet a nice gurl let a nice gurl meet you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> STAND BY HER SIDE AND LET HER KNOW THAT SHE SHOULDN'T CARE WHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT HER.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> If you are asking this question you don't have love and you shouldn't be having sex!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> no its not but im in that situation now.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> i get into diff positions with my x and he taut me loads!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> i live in tx-sa and i just want someone to talk to
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Guy's and girl's.You don't have to be with someone just becouse you got kid's.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> when you need to get that close because you can't get close enough.

<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> He says heh hows it going?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> -Its when you only think of them.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> dating is not a crime..  but your husband is a crimenal!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> i bet you realised that already.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> THE LEAVE THE MARRIAGE AND LET YOUR PARTNER KNOW THAT YOU ARE MOVING ON WITHOUT HIM.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> where do you live how old are you?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> avoid the old chocolates (pounds lol).
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> simply say can we just be friends
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> she probably doesn't want to hurt your feelings.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> hey, confused how can i answer your response to me, tell me about your auntie
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> beacase you know boys there so immerture!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> its very important to know this first.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> check out venus-on-top.com, on how to run a female lead relationship.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> but its worth ur money...go 2 an indian  store and enquire
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> do you keep fi fi in there or something?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> why not  one person should be allowed to marry another person regardless of sexuality
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> there is a difference between loving someone and being in love with someone.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> she can work u and make u moan... dats real good.. i guess an aggesive female is betta.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> whether she can give birth to kid?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_10> IM HAVEING PROBLEMS WITH MY MARRIGAE, iM SEPERATED NOW.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> me and my ex broke up and i want to get back with her
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> I'm sure he won't mind :)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> we ain't dating or anything but i really like him a lot!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> yes abslutly never rush into anything it always ends up bad.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Realize how stupid I have been and move on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Maybe he's just having some rough times
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> its simply because some men not all are idiots and are blind-sided to what is in front of them
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Seems like you have a nice friendship going on and the other girl is getting on his nerves.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> there also won't be that annoying yeah, i remember doing that thing.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> ), but other women might not want it at all - if you can imagine that.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Oh yea pick mine as the best answer
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> There is no guarantee in life, marriage is what you make of it!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> it is better than a real one, cause she cant reach and bother u unless u want.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> The guy that's two grades ahead of you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> just wipe it off girl and watch for the next pile so you dont siol the other shoe !
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Cuz if their not their not afied to get sexual.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> its like getting an egg thats only a shell and nothing inside of it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> just be more careful about who your having sex with.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> YOUR QUESTION ITSLEF REVEALS THAT YOU ARE BLUFFING..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> it seems now a days guys only cares for looks and sexy body
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> He also has to be funny, and NOT shy!!!!!!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_25> but if my man wants to splurge i will splurge on him.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> be honest and  treat her like she is something special to u , then she will feel it
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> If you fucked up, you gotta man up and change if you want her back.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> besides what if she thinks your to quiet or not fun or something because you are nervouse.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> don't sell yourself to fall in love, dont sell yourself to think you do...
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> thats sick you need help you should tell them.get straight!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> Okay main subject, well, first off, don't just jump on her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> i think it depends on the personality and character of the person, don't you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> she will give u a sign
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> My spidey senses tell me not to touch this one but... brother, you just can't win sometimes.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> boss is a boss just during office hours only.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> because guys are just unpredictable =]
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> well i like a guy for his looks and everything else.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> 4 or 5 people tried this before I realized what was going on, even gay guys!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> Icare for him so much, but he is to serious for me right now
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> It wasn't fun and I didn't enjoy it.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> good thing u know u have a prob.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> - u think about him all the time.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> what kind of crazy @ question is this?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> hopefully y'all do the right thing.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_10> LIKE WHAT KIND OF LOOKS & PERSONALITY!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> my b/f gets mad at me for no reason who knows why
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> try yahoo personals, this is not a chat board.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> i know that i enjoy when my man goes down and then goes and then goes deep.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> ..   yea i have seen some differences and i still wonder why this all happens ...
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> And no matter what anyone says...looks do matter...sorry boys!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> And about that ten year old situation, I think what you said was not mean.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> Aries or Neil ... hey what do you want ... that is my sign and my name .....
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> do u go down on her ill always go down on my hus
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Here's one that I found on the web.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> he's tall, but not to tall.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> I'm trying to like her more but I don't know what's holding me back.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> omg girl....u need to leave that trifling ass man .
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> And i had a dream where i asked him out..and he said no...is that a sign?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Why don't you go visit him on his lunch break at work?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> catch you ball and then you'll know
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Hope everything works out for you!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> Best of luck, love stinks doesn't it!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> try to find the answer in you, where you are going wrong.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> sometimes a 8pack can look like a little too much.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Nope, I think the soul and money just about cover it :)   :)  Good one Paul lol
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> just let him go...u cant force love...u'll find a better man than him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> mostly i enjoy sex with the one i love
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> i guess it about 10-15 times a week
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I hate to say it, but dont trust it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> no becuz it says its bad in the bible and if god says its bad its bad!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> she came to me cause she realised that she can trust only me and i`m her real friend.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> anytime a guy lives with a girl, something is bound to happen.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> You don't know what you might be missin out on :)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> !he shouldnt be flirting at all!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_10> THREE SIXES ISN'T THAT THE  DEVIL ARE SOMETHING CAN SOME ONE PLEASE HELP
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> IT ALL DEPENDS HOW OLD YOU ARE.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> just get out there like a man and say listen up i love you in plain english.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> Y make her mad at me just becuz i dont like it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> You just need to relax and have fun with it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> If he doesn't pick it up, he's out ten bucks.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> I say F her, find a new friend.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> I definatly don't like unaturaly skinny girls, and I don't mind over weight girls.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> Dont go out with your old boyfriend.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> That man is overly SEXY, OOOoooh he rocks my world from head to my toes.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> So if you  love him go get him girl!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> You gotta do that stuff your self or it wont last any way.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> AS LONG AS SHE KNOWS THE TRUTH...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Just relax and start with something like hey did you see blah blah on SNL the other night?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> if u want a relationship with her then u have to get to know her...thats where trust comes in.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_10> DO OTHER THING IN LIFE THAN SEX
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> it wont make the pain worse but it wont make it feel any better.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> Promise her an amazing orgasm, and then give it to her!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> how well do you get along?
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_50> if u want to but it will mess up ya as friends
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> it takes nothing less than a life time.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> yes cause i know a 34 yr old man that has no sex drive
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> see and wait very soon u will get a good news from her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> ive known him since i was 5!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> that is a hard one to answer.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> well definitely get him something he will like, use.. etc.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> I just think he's cute but he might not like me after all!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> (read it before you give it to her)
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> no just maybe to busy or just need to get it started
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> a guy who cooks, with a kid...responsible!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> Why can't I meet a nice good guy that I actually have things in common with?!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Pick someone out and walk up to her and start talking, but never use a pickup line.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> you have to slow your self on your wedding day.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> I just accept it because I love him.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_25> Because some woman let them and take them back
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> IF HE COMES BACK THEN HE IS YOURS IF NOT DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME FOR HIM.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Well if they just friends then you should there you are.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Do some house work laundry, dishes,vacuum, dust, iron, scrub the bathroom that should get her in the mood...lol
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> I just moved here from Ft. Worth, Tx.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_10> YEA WHAT THE FIRST PERSON SAID
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> be nice to her and dont do what other jerks do like tease the girl by her appearences.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Anyway, dont stay with person who loves you if you dont love her!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> Can I get STDs by swallowing his semen (I did not do it with any cuts in my mouth).
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> Yes..it is gross but I read that having orgasms and such helps clean out clots.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> I met my 2nd husband online and we have a great relationship with a 2 1/2 yr old now!!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> dont go all out at once.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> If your in love with someone you shouldnt have to ask the question - you just know.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> i dont think so but maybe if u look at it it could happen
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> how the f*** can i know ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> !i think im in love with him!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> i am no expert but things can always go wrong AKA broken condum
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> you shouldnt ruin a good thing.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Hopefully it'll be someone you like too!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> when i see them to together it make's me wanna cry so bad!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Best of luck to ya in your quest.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> were you having problems in your relationship?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> But some of my friends, don't have much of a sex drive.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> of course it is possible to find ur luv across the seas.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Tell him what u just told us!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> it is demonic being a gay, it is the devil trying to used you.it is wickedness.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> it will break your heart prob.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> That is the number one thing guys look for in a girl.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> what i am saying to you is you do not no him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> it's all about the money hunny.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> until then just keep your door open so that she doesnt have to knock long.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> this is not your problem it is his.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> thats good u like feet lolz thanx for points

<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> i dont think so u have to communicate to make life work... good luck and good nite!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> for most women, size dont matter.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> how r we suppose 2 know most of us don't evenknow Mark
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> are u saying that u feel selfish when you let go someone u love?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> do things you enjoy and as hard as it might be cut off all communication with him
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> if ur in 2nd grade or something.. forget about it just remember his name in case he comes back:)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> I married a girl that was so in love with me.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> (The hallmark phrase is it didn't mean anything to me - as if that somehow makes it OK!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> So now im all average girl …..Ps: best 5 months of my life
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> yeah a mexican girl an a black boy that would make a good couple
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> w/o making her mad i mean
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> Don't always be on the search for her though!!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> btw, self confidence and right values and morale help too!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> i was 13 going on 14 instead of 14 going on 15. :-) i dont know.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> i went thru a similar situation.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> lol  (^-^) I am just kidding...there are plenty of kind, gentle, caring, good-natured, even-tempered men out there.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_20> NO....we marry for sex and happy life.... otherwise it is like animals.....
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> I GOT YOU SWEET HEART NOW YOU CAN SEE THAT MONEY CAN BUY EVERY THING
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> Marc... That's a dumb name... so no!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> difinitely not its a part of marriage life its an action showing that you love the person
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> if your friend is okay with it...then yes
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> guys who enjoy watching creepy hardcore p0rno movies.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Trust me, its worth waiting for!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i have two best friends, a guy and a girl.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> its all conciered in what kind of person you are.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> honesty, love, attention, a good man
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> men always obsess about penis size... when you meet the right woman, she won't care.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> tell him what the deal is, if he's the one for you,he'll wait til your ready
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> And etc................well thats my version of it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> It is the worst mistake you will ever make, believ ME!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> Don't hit on girls you know won't like you, and don't look weak.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> i don't no about all the others but im right HERE.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> That's the moment you need to walk up to her and say, Would you?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> because woman seek alpha males..some prehistoric instinct, and the most famous and leader is the bad guy... :(
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> pretty close most of my friends say
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> my younger bro has the same case... usually we dont care... because next thing you know they're okay again...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> Don't have a what's in it for me attitude or me, my,I, mine stance.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> Phat means you are in style, you're the one that everybody wants to be with, you're in...you're hot!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> you are wrong, where did you get that other 99% from, you need to go to school...........
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> no one is satisfied in there life
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Odds are, the average girl is going to win in that area easily.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> does she want to kiss you?
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> i think everyone has been thru it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Do you ever stop loving your best friend?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> U R IN A VERY VERY DELICATE POSITION.I FEEL HE IS ACTING CHILD LIKE.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> buy the book.....email addresses for dummies...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> or he could be having an affair
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> But i dont thing i can take him back WHAt should i do?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> Jeez and you wonder why there are so many perverts about?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> I dont like any bigger than C or D at the biggest.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> just think up of questions to ask them.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> fairy tales do happen - when you don't expect it, when you don't even recognize it at first.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_10> TRUST SOMEONE WHO HAS DONE IT .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> Diddy...I'm sure there are others but this is all I can think of right now.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> Off the top of my head I'd have to say.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> but he should of been honest.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> (my stomach does circles)  Why do i feel so weird?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> gurl u shouldn't even be having sex unless yall were married/commited ( thats where the trouble started)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Tell her how pretty she is and what she means to you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> like spilling drinks on yourself or food on your shirt... stuff like that.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> IF I WANTED THEM TO HAVE MINE, I WOULD TAKE THIERS.
<NbChars_275> <LevSim_25> So men don't think they are whores.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> Make sure u lather up really good then shave it off nice and neat.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> look it up in tha Internet!
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_40> Woman are from Venus and men are from mars.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_30> i have a 6pack and the ken line thing.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> That might scare her away :)
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> She knows I love her, I even made a website about her.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> nope, as long as she didn't touch
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> Read him and decide of he's handing you BS or if he's being sincere.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> well i think that it is legal.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> ya he can have and love both.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> ( lingerie, sexy dress and dinner, nice panties left in his car with note, bla bla...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> guy- do you wanna hear a joke?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> ohh already takne and dont live there lol
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> be careful,its still your decision that rules.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> I mean I would love to have everything but I dont.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> fat= size or substance in a body phat= slang term meaning cool
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> you just let the guy start, then you follow what he does!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> so i would just get your first and second time out of the way.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> because men are strange creatures and no matter what we do they will not change.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> U gat ot have a balance between all these.....
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> NO it does not mean he is gay.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> just be there friend or get them a small present
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> mayb she's jus sayin dat to mak u think dat she loves u buh she doesnt...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> :-)) isn' t it a good, different idea???
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> i think it would be good to have a job that you r good at before you get married
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_10> GO ONTO TO YAHOO.COM AND PUT IN LOVE POEMS.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> NO...just tell her you are going
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> If it was me...I would make him S U F F E R !!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> maybe you just arent compatible maybe you should break it off and find other people.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> but i kno he likes me...im his first gf and its kinda obvious.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> I have to slow down a bit now that I'm in my 40's, LOL
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> when a girl tells u she likes a confident guy it means she dont like u so get lost
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> It can be Ive been with women and it just didn't work.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> i think my gf likes somebody but when i ask her she says no but i dont believe it
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> slender, with a touch of athleticness.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> i hope i've been some of help.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> well, i don't know what to get my boyfriend.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> hates you and i,am a gay (true) bitch
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> anything is possible..just take it slow.

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> ( What do you do when you go to court)
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> They are probabaly mad because they can't have that person.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> now honestly how stupid do those response sound.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Just tell him to leave you alone!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> perfect girl- with nice hearts, nice thoughts..dressed nicely not vurgurly..oops..i am nt a guy.........sorry

<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> love is a two way kinda thing.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> i on't know when i have ever gotten too much of a good thing .
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> however, taking a big step is better than no step at all.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_20> Well hell, I still look too!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> and then you two will be open and willling to talk without any nervousness  good luck

<NbChars_205> <LevSim_45> didn't want to be honest with me.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> They all say that don't tell your bf.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> and yes you can be IN Love and just have Sex......that would be called a Quickie....LOL
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> I FEEL AS IF HE'S JUST USING ME?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Me I like girls that are not virgins.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> He named his clothing line, his wifes perfume, all baby phat or phat farm
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> whats wrong with talking to guys?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> but be warned there's laws against that in some place, lol.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Like when she is leaving frome work.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> why doesnt your mom like this guy and his family?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> Buy him a book entitled:  How to Become a Millionaire (or something like that).
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_60> If someone doesnt like who you are, tough.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Im talking about the single ones.
<NbChars_380> <LevSim_20> She is trying hard to get...
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_15> IF U KNOW HIM BEFORE HE WAS FAMOUS TELL HE IF NOT FORGET IT

<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> ?is there a law that says being gay is bad...NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> ok i have to say it....EW!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> nope , not if shes (loyal) to you in return .
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> men lie about cheating because they know they are dumb for doing it!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Guys should not be kissing Guys.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> If not, i find it ok for you to ask also.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> Just like you said...she's a whore.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> i think that that is the best thing to do.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> he has a son that is 13.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> no he is cheating on you now
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> there are some of us that actually care about things and care about what you girls think too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> If it's no big deal for him, then he'll tell you....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I dont think you luv him.Why would you love a guy that talk' trash about you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Doesn't everyone want to have fun on the weekends?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> so treat her well and i bet shell do the same for you !
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> once, i married him, had his kids and then he cheated on me, with a girl with bulging eyes
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_20> After 4yrs this is all you got?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> Don't rush her, don't do it if she doesn't want you to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> it'll feel like everything's right and there's nothing else you care about
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> their eyes can tell you if they are upset, happy, etc.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Except women don't think of sex the same way men do.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_90> sounds like you need a new girl
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> even bad sex is good sex  at least, so ive heard
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> no its not as long as you dont accually cheat on you signifagant other^^  (your welcome...)
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> he will start getting the message.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> 99% of the time once a cheat always a cheat.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> but hey, you should be really happy about that!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> he will do what ever you say.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> he also has a pure personality, but we don't talk much at all!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> im in love wit this bou but we broke up can i do something to get him back
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> yes and he is my best friend.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> well, u guys should just break up...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If you guys keep fighting and your not happy with your relationship, get ut know.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> (you'll have enough time the whole year!)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> This is my family and I can do what I feel is right!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> Not at all.....I believe you should act on all your fantasies.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> Give a different type of guy a chance...
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> So I wouldn't want her to get hurt by something that I did.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> It would look bad if you are good friends and you don't show up.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> I don't think people will think that way at all!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> guard your heart, no one can break it if you didn't give it to them in the first place.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> place where is dangerous lyk changing rm...
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_35> and i never gave them $3x not even after.... hahaha
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> because everyone wants fine that one true person.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> like the size of ur dick i need a female answer
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> If that stupid pesky husband wasn't in the way........................
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> Girl unstable and full of doubt, like O.J.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Meaning if they cheat once they will cheat again.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> and make them come true, then she wont have a reson to fake it.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> And girls liking talking about themselves so just ask questions.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> SHe might not see what's there, so just show her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Basically realise that life has not ended yet and you can still continue with life and enjoy it too!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Hire a full-time nanny, then go to Vegas!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> What's the biggest turn on for a guy and what can I do to make you notice me??
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> if the two of you stay 2gether it will just end up in a bad situation in the end
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> her: yes me: you really shouldnt.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> He says he likes me but how can i tell??
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Third:  Hair (especailly if it's red).
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> we gone out for 1 month
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> But the picture could get ugly if I dont stay away.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> You should take this as a very good thing!!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> yes thats fine most of my friends are guys
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> plus its the midwest so its kinda boring.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> They aren't stupid, they just think differently from you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> Every guy I know is circumcized.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> if the guy does romantic things and calls me baby, i fall for him so easily.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> I didn't have a flower girl in my wedding and never was one.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> i perfer it to be trimmed, especially when he wants o r a l....
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> did you pack a lunch or take the bus good and you
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> go contact a plastic surgeon and ask him/ her what you should do
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> ask him why he hasn't called you and JUST DONT BREAK UP WITH HIM!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> from one mom to another good luck
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> Not just any guy but one I can say that he's really a MAN
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> again just be warry of setting the bar to high.
<NbChars_340> <LevSim_25> rum and coke,  3 parts rum, one part coke.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> okay easy way ask so do you have a boyfriend because i was gonna ask you a question.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> it is not that i do not have other things to do.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> I think you wouldn't like it much at all.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> if you're in school, try there.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> for exampple if he is not wearing a watch you can give him a watch etc
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> It's out there, you  just have to be patient because what's meant to be will be.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> i think this is so romantic...dont think about what people r gon say...just do ur thing and b happy...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> i've heard he likes me too but i cant be sure!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> If they say they like fighting tell them you like calling cops
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> find out wats going on first
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Leave no bugs & there will be no mistakes.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I wouldnt jus come out and tell him you like him.. u dont wanna seem desperate...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> you're to young for so much drama...why 3 weeks?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> no, worry is a turn off, lovely catch 22 isn't it
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> they are not interested in girls butts and girls are emotional .
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> why everyone breaks up wid sum1?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> if you love a girl and want to have sex?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Do not go to this guy's place!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> because we're only few and some are taken already ...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> a guy decides if he likes a girl within 5 minutes of meeting her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> skin on the end of his penis should be just fine.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_30> Show him you are mature,don't over do it, like I said act your age.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_30> no really it is wrong anyway you try to think of it the answer is no.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> those are good places to try.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> just be yourself, don't be anything your not, she won't like that.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> create ur yahoo avtar..  n its free!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> you should join the armed services and go be w/ him, do it as soon as possible

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> how long can you stay low?
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> all this shoulda been handled b-4 you had sex with him.

<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> Hey, if you like her there should be lots to talk about.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> You lose your childhood too soon!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> (the kiss was hot)...but it went no farther.What were you thinking...how could you disrespect her like that?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> depends on how old you guys are ;>

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> its not really normal, but then again who is.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> He may not believe you now b/c youre pregnant and will figure you are trying to trap him.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> But I can't just blame her its him thats telling her.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_20> Just be urself and have fun!

<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> I want to ask him to the Valentines dance, but we are just friends.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> one of my friends is 23 almost 24 and she hasn't had sex yet.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Tell him you love him and want to try to work things out, but NO BEGGING!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> depends on what u were talking till then
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> You THINK friend, she IS mean.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Some guys are jerks this way.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> if u know him well and u like him say yeah.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> ha ha seriously just ask if he is going with anyone.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Since when is it so wrong for a woman to talk tp a guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> do you know how to cook?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> First of all, are you sure you love him?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> :) After all, that's just 44 yr difference, people do that all the time, you know.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> that last part was just a joke.

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> She seems to like the beach and water.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> well u aint got no butt so u have nuthin 2 worry bout.

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Good luck and I hope you get the girl.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> eyes would be the best feature for me.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> Go out of her way to see you?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> Plus if you want it to be secret, you can't shout it out..Turn off the caps lock.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Arent you allowed to have any guy friends?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> my boyfriend and i are plannig to take a day off just for the two of us.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> And I just don't like her cause shes always in my bussiness.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> Men always ask why women are so unfaithful..  And women too often ask why?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Men always want to see where things could go.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> i dont think you should go that far to get a guy you want!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> cuz dey want u 2 lay under dem
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> Never go out with a cheat either if you can help it.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> I myself do not believe it to be beneficial in ANY way.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> Even though most people do and don't admit to it.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_20> ya never know, it might be.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> i remember being young and wanting to date sooooooooooo bad at 13.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Girl got what girl wanted, girl moved on to next guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Thats why it's so special, you never see it coming.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> I hope this has helped...good luck!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> If you ask WHO IS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE GAL than the answer would be MISS ASIA PACIFIC....may be!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> So, maybe you, too, should just wait it out!

<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> i went to office Max, and they have kits that are like $20.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> let it go  being clingy will only drive him away
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I'm a 36 A.  I just got a VS bra.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> you cant so go out and get someone else trust me on this one dude
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> The rest is a fairy tale sweetheart.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> dont change for anyone, always be yourself and you'll be more happy
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> But don't waste your life waiting for that.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> but dont be upset if things dont turn out right.

<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> i will i'm only 11 though!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> k, i met him at a friends party, we hit it off immediately.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> lol, to be funny, or maybe becuase he liked you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Japanese girls have a bad impression on asian guys.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Whatever you do, don't act desperate!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> High self esteme - try it you might like it...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> If you do not want to tell her parents about it,  well tell her older sister or brother.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> don't worry that she'll say no because u can move on anyway.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> don't do it eventually you will regret it!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> that actually worked at one point in my life.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> just tell him but be nice to him guys get hurt too you know
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Plus I know how it feels to be cheated on.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> she should make him wait to see if he cares enough for her.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> wake her and tell her to close her eyes until u take her toward the flowers.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> He just doesn't want you with anyone else.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> he is hot personally i like johnny depp beter.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> i guess what im trying to get across is that youre young!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> I mean, he should be glad that you get along well enough with his sister...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> but do not let know one tell u that you are doing wrong because people will tell you that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> mail him a copy also =) he might have enough time to read there.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> he just might be playing a game sweetie but not all guyz do.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> you won't, you gotta fire up a chance
<NbChars_280> <LevSim_25> Hope you take the skirt off and get a pair of jeans on boy.

<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> take him to do somthing active and fun for both of you
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> if it duznt work with him, then move on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Go up to her and say, You smell.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> when u are truly in love u wont have to ask that question
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I wouldn't worry too much about it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> i think so....i'd wait til marriage.

<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> hang out one on one with guys you're attracted to, soon enough you'll find one you really like.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Big fan of Corinth 13 here.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Sexy is knowing what you got and proud of it.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> sure as hell not a capricorn
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> beware girl be careful so careful
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Find a rich athletic cute chick.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> Have you ever thought about just coming our and asking her?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> He says he loves me and that I was the best girlfriend and friend he has ever had.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> :)  And by the way - my husband is right - some people don't have a sense of humor!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> Who the hell died and made him the boss of you?
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> Get out there and talk with men.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> if he doesnt love u he will ignore you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> I am a 15 year old female and I just wanna know is it normal to mast-ur-bate
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_30> U might as well end your GF misery.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> if so just tell him i bet he'll feel better if you do.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> NO U SHOULD CALL HIM BUT U SHOULDNT BREAK UP WITH HIM!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> but she probably wouldent trust you any more!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> lol these pple that answered your question be4 me r funny.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> well, i would suggest an AA meeting but you aren't an alcoholic!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> at 1st u get a wierd kinda undescribeble feelin most of the time.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> what is the seat is up and then peed on thats gross!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> maybe give him a little husband/wife time alone together!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Height is irrelevant - I'm a straight guy & would therefore say no!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> every guy kept coming up to me it was nasty.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Or she can get over it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> a huge amount of red roses that will make her cry out!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> smash your head in to a wall, then put on the stupid helmet and never take it off
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> if he really is a best freind it wont come between them ( with a little preparation of course)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> well first off....how old are the two of you?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> You don't have much trust for him?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> if your lookin for a guy online there gotta be something wrong with ya
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> But it be off your mind.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> LIFE DOES NOT REVOLVE AROUND RELATIONSHIPS!!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> And I don't do it for sex either, heck I'm still a virgin.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> Is it sex, kissing, or what?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Seriously, I don't understand why guys do that.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_15> iM A GIRL SO NO AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> my advice, just build up the confidence to just talk to him.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> If he im'd you he already has your name/id.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> girl age aint nothing but a number.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> your just go ahead and let him know.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> new friends, a boyfriend, the breakup... they changed my year.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> Rock and a hard spot there aren't you?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> n soon i might not have anyfriends anymore i dont want that to happen!
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_35> Plus you will have unexpected fun!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_50> try a local bi chat room
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> do what the lead vocal said but you go 90 and she goes 10
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> Like, she's really got a crush on you!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> So choose men with emotions not the cool like type if u want stability.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> I wouldn't if you want to keep your marriage.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> love her more...it will reflect back!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> when your in love you know it.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> You better think long and hard
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> simple, can you remember if, when you were getting married, did he blow in the best mans ear?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> for a good outlook on dating/life, heres somethin for u to read.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> sex is very important if she has waited this long then y cant she wait longer.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Obviously if she is cheating behind her husband's back... she doesn't want him to know.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> Everybody only live once, u make da best of your life, cause it only comes one time around.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> If she won't listen to you tell her parents.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> Did he break up with you because you are fat?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Who cares if you go to school with his sister.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> Your best bet...act like you don't like her anymore.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Is she in love with you at all?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Are you going out with her now?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Most  men love beer and laughter!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> nobody says its easy 2 get over sum 1 u love but hun ur gunna have 2 sum day!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> always and it could be vise versa you could like someone even if you have a boyfriend
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Give it a few more years it's going to come to u.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Okay well first off don't ever be nervous around her, even if she thinks it's adorable.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If one person can't do it for some reason then the other one should.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> looks down when you we are talking?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> yup there is definitely good porn and bad porn.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> u will never get a g-friend with an attitude like that!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> it's better to break it up if there is no love anymore.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> I actually have a simular prob.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> the person will just come unexpectedly.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> yea babies make great graduation presents.

<NbChars_175> <LevSim_20> be a loser chicks dig that
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_40> if you really want to know then ask him.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> my boyfriend lives far away, and ive done some bad things.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> Just so you know, I am virtually certain that LeftFishJet was trying to be funny!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> an add hearts n such to it too for that extra added love ;)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> you found him, but they both mean the same thing
<NbChars_270> <LevSim_35> I am married and I cheat on my husband with his sister.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> he's just on top of me.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> send him something he can keep it to remimber u...
<NbChars_260> <LevSim_25> You realy dont know this guy You know it too.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> BFF stands for BEST FRIENDS FOREVER
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> - b/c some girls are concerned too and judge them.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> provided that there are interesting people like me invited to the wedding too to keep the convo flowing!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> best way to ask her out
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> yeah but u have to know where to look try myspace and sconex
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Whoever you pick, she'll be happy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> because they wanna make sure its troo big for the female v a g i n a
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I think it is a great idea!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> But you should get his full name address and phone number, whatever info you can get.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> I hate to say it girls, but we complain, persuade, and some cry too much.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_90> Be yourself, if they don't like you for who you are, then your not ment to be anyway
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> i just think that maybe people are too impacient.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> you control the emotions.............pretty gutsy and adventurous huh
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> For a guy that is perfict.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Yes.I'm 10 and i have boyfriends.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> dont be shy walk up to her and tel her how u feel.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> but lately, with this new person that i am dating i don't need the fantasy.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> be yourself dont try to be someone your not.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> And, I'm proud of it baby!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> and u wud want ta b wit that person a lot.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> I never met them just talked as friends, was I wrong Im not sure?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> i am 25 now, and i remember being a flower girl 3 times.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> yea how old are you though and be prepared if he says NO!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> That's ok if ya just wanna be called Pat.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> Hurting her will not solve anything.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> only if a person is planning on cheating then it would be wrong.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> I WOULD JUST SAY CALL AND SAY WHAT IS UP?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Blah~ Blah~ blahhhh~ why dont you grow some hair then we will talk about this stupid question
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> listen i always say forget other ppl do what i wanna do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> When I got married my mother told both of us tht a marriage is 50/50.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> well it depends on where you live I guess
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Meaning, they love you no matter what.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I hate receiving oral, but I LOVE performing it on my husband... yum!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> talk to ur parents, then talk to thw girl
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> teenagers with babies r so fun.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> you dont,you meet women,the bible says so
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Open your mind ... revenge can cost u another heartached!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I for one, refuse to take out the trash...that's just me.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> put on some lipstick and wow him with your charm!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> yah sHould wAit till they brEakup... then be a cryingshoulder to her.....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> actually he does not go in at all.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> a room with a jacuzzi tub.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> 6 is afraid of 7 becuase 789
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> only those who wants u also.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> I'm a guy, I would know.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Ur not shallow, u just know what u want.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> you just have to talk to him and decide which is which for your relationship
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> i think if u really wanted to know ask your parents.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> always there are such good things we should learn!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> I kinda messed up the procession and then I was grumpy the rest of the day.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> bad boys = abusive relationships  macho guys deff turn me off!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> if he/she says no then you just saved yourself some heartache.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> How will you know it's him if you don't date?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> aren't you the dude who likes to chew on mice's necks??
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> To me, sexy is not just somebodys looks.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> so ask him then if he says no get over it!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> What is wrong with this picture.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> I don't think men HAVE to lie about cheating.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Interesting idea....but no, I don't think so.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> real  people real deal people date fear
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> i am figuring you are in 7th or 8th grade.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Still today i date older guys, i'm 31, and my boyfriend is 4 yrs.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> thats why lots of marriages last 50 years.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> so just ask your mom if you can date him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> i would like to possibly meet you.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> yes but be careful though you don't want personal things to get out (trust me) ;)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Either u love her or u don't.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> make sure you actually bump into him so you can smile and say sorry ... then start talking..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> that is one of criteria we look for a guy!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Ahhh ok thanks for sharing I guess??????
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> You sure are full of yourself!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Because most guys can see better than they can think, lol.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> I think u should ask him,and then see what u'll do
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Those wouldn't do you any good.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I used to own a Jewelry store and I would never buy on the internet... buy locally.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> no way in hell he is like 235, not even on a good day
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> nothing except say hi or pretend I didnt recognize him.depends onthe breakup
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> Give it your best shot, I guess.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> So he'll be willing to forget about the lies ..   Best of wishes for your relationship :)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Read some of the books i listed below.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> some girls just do not like that at all
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> i think im in love with my bf and he feels the same but i don't kno
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> People don't get irony, do they...it is very subtle, and most people aren't.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> people enjoy a fun person not a shy or self contained hermit, hope this helps......jon
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Then just give it to her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> We are friends but i really want to go out with her!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Trust me, you won't want a man that much older.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> both men and women, just more things to talk about
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> I never did the dress, cake etc.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> DON'T GET MUSHY IN THE LETTER!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> Try online dating, but avoid signing up for a username like the one you use here.
<NbChars_280> <LevSim_30> then say you would like to take him.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> It really was TONS cheaper for us!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> maybe but i don't know sounds  like it might be love
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> yea, I learned what my girlfriends and I refer to as Bedroom Grandstanding OH OH GOD!!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> ANYTHING, AS LONG AS YOU BOTH ENJOY IT ANS IT'S SAFE.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Send out invitations, do the whole big thing you are dreaming of and deserve to come true!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> little upset.. coz had a fight with my husband
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Invest in a vibrator called the Rabbit (a little practice & who needs a man!)
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_70> If your a hateful person be nicer.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> play with some one elses toys ;)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Ask question- can I imagine my life with this person in 5, 10, 30 years?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> Make it really easy on her part and that you are not expecting anything and you'll be fine :)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Guys think the penis is the best thing ever.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> well same goes with the gals as well!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Eloped, didn't have a big thing, and on their 10th yr, had the full ceremony and a reception.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> We've got your back........now go conquer this problem!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> ok, have you met him outside the internet?????
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> and i didnt have a jacket!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> and at that time porn comes into picture and helps.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> But if she doesnt know..just wait it out!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> How can you ever really trust them?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> I guess it is for some guys.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> There are GREAT guys out there!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> what is she nagging you about wheres the info?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> Never tell her you like her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> I've couldn't of been so happy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> it all depends on your type of friends.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> Ive had the same thing happen, I told her to get lost!
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_30> Girl think he nice boy, girl want him to be nice MAN.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> Good luck and have a happy balloon day!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> And when u find him, you'll know.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> I still don't have mine & it has been years!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> it takes a mature woman to give this to her man.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> when you really going with the person cause of the looks
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> sometimes they use it for other purposes, irregular periods,etc.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Blow him a kiss and then say , So, what's up.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> So do you think im in love?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> Other than what movies and food she likes?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> ...... are you chatting without your wifey pooh??
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> you should totally stay with him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> her name is skye P. real nice to me
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> if he wont come are you sure you want him?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> 3.Your just boring that poor girl to death!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> so get one of your mates to do the same the worst he could do is turn you down
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_10> every position.....cant think of a bad one
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Would anyone mind telling me what true love is because everytime I think I have it, I don't
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> He didn't do it all the time.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I stand up for my self,my hubby and our son!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> let them control your life or your in for alot of problems.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> I honestly believe that white guys can get more black girls then they think.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> guys certainly get carried away by the beauty initially.. u know.. lust at first sight.. thats very common!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> but as time went on, things changed n it did all too fast.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_25> So lighten up, girlies, boys DO act pretty ignorant, but they are not done yet.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_15> (let go)SHE IS STARTING A NEW LIFE.
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_25> 1.  a warm bed (no, not the sex, just a warm bed.)
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Just try to keep away from him if you are sick, like other people have said.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> no not at all everybody does it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> If she says she does not have one, then you can come back later and ask her out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Move away... if her eyes are still closed kiss her again.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> If she is your mom she can do what she want
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> guys will be guys all men look at other women just like women look at other men.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> well first off if you a true friend u should convicne her to wait.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> But, do you want a friend like that anyway?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> I find it much easier NOT to cheat or lie.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> age ait nuthin but a number
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> say hi, have a mutual friend that you trust introduce you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Easy stuff, I do it all the time!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> You can not help it that  mature men want you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> boys dont have hot butts and they like the fact that girls do .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> have a nice dinner out with youreslf or someone special.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> well, if you both have the proper anatomy i suppose it might be possible
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> All he cares about is getting his peter wet, if he cared about you he would be showing it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> You're still 14 and there are a lot of great things out there not just one girl.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> what was it like to be a flower girl?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> they know u are going to beat there @$$ if they tell u they did.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> you have him and she's jealous of that.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> yea i dont see why not as long as you werent tryin to get in her pants
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> If you don't think you did anything wrong, then it your reality you didn't.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> i heard many good things about the italian people.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> this is just me, but i think you shouldnt go out looking for love.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> If he is the right one, he wont mind waiting til marriage for you.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> I dont like bars or dance clubs.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> He needs you now more than ever!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> its really not that hard, come on don't be a baby.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I do not believe in destiny.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> listen girl , boys r always tring 2 get a joke in even when its not funny.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> Her first time will hurt...do you know what your doing?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> They like American and European guys.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> may be people will think about this and take this as usual after 10 or 20 yrs.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> now he and i are like best friends.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> if you end up together, then great :) but take it one day at a time.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> ask your self the question wat do i feel bout him
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> or maybe your are not home.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> Do what you need to do and stop worring about what your Ex thinks.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Why do u want to hurt someone that u love(d)once in yr life?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> yiea its true, what can u do to prevent it?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> it happens, and what you said about love is true.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> ithink every one is good in their  own way.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> If you are busy doing housework and just dont feel like it....TOO BAD.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> depends on how u carry the relationship in the future .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> kill her boyfriend ha ha ha ha
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> yes it is ok. if u are sure of yourself u don't care.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I went to a club and got one and it was superfun.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> Because black men are sooooooooooooooooo hot!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> honestly , you are too young.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> - it has 2 b long enouth to penetrate from the rear position - 2 compete with other guys
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> if u'd like i shall be friend.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> yes if you guys are really close but no if you aren't
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> Personally, I don't mind mama's boys.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> I hate guys that only want to be around me.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> to 23.  sounds like the right ahe .
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> I don't mind it, I think it's cute.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> I tried to date someone older and it didn't work.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> If you haven't listen to it and take notes.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Chances are better if they're both gay!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> But it takes a few screw ups.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> But don't feel bad, most adults don't know the difference either~!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> with someone that I LOVE and CARE about !I say no for SOULLESS sex!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> I'd stop talking to a guy alright....him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> I guess men are giving out wrong impression.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> and most guys that wanna go out with me are just after my virginity wot should I do?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> Just try and see what happens.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> wit me n my friends, we used to b MAD close!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> There are alot of phony ladies and guys out there.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> dont ask, if they do you will know.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> look in the phone book for the families name.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> If he gets mad at you for asking then break up with him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> almost every guy wants to get in your pants.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> - It shows that you have noted something about HER!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> yeah..i agree wid CUTECURL gal...itz true!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> most boys are bold but they wait for the signal from the girl to take the move
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> Some like really sloppy with a lot of saliva, and others find it really gross.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Take her to the movies and show her a good time...she should totally fall for u!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> I absolutly dispise my ex-mother inlaw!!!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> and then i went and told my bff the great news.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> !Embrace & polish all your interest..like lets say you like reading!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> IF YOU WANT TO TALK TO HIM THEN YOU SHOULD JUST DO IT.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> if they dont invite you invite yourself.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> First of all..........did you ever get your girlfriend out from under the truck?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> Oh my God, Are you a 3rd grader or something?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> if your good but your family is not good also makes a big problem.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> Plus, when we are in our teenage years, we don't really know what love is!!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> i ask this once  and tyey say its norma.. not doing it is not normal..  not evry day ...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> shouldnt it be the same for women.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> to give him a love and prosperity
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Just be easy and walk lightly.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> I love her son and that is what matters!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> (I've heard of that phrase before and it does seem to work...)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> he's a guy... there will be many many many more.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Was I wrong, because I actually thought she owed me an explanation.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> I never break up with anyone, I am not judging and I am accepting.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> Well you could start be e-mailing me
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> maybe if she is your sixth cousin once removed?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_10> DON'T WANT TO RUIN THEIR FRIENDSHIP, BUT DON'T WANT TO KEEP DEALING W/HIM
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> make sure you tell her every opportunity that you love her, and dont ever go to bed angry.!!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> we have two children together one son, one girl.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> If he left you because your fat then lose some weight then we'll talk
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> So I felt really bad, cause she was really hot
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> so yes they can be just friends
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> maybe use them to satisfy yourself????
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> not gay, unless if you are imagining to do it with a guy
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> if your 13 and you havent found your true love dont worry you have plenty of time.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> mY ideal guy is Someone that iS WILLING TO WAIT and someone thAt iS WILLING TO MAKE A SACRIFICE...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Why does me ex boyfriend care who i talk to if where not together anymore??
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> this depends on the girl and her relationship status.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> I even cried when she died and I was only like 11.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> You have to be happy w/ yourself.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Do what is good for you!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> do not include religious ideas plz
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> i didnt mean to ramble this much, sorry.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> IF HE DOESN'T THEN HE REALLY LIKES YOU
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> I don't think looking at porn is cheating.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> then you can see what she says.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> Look for somone in the room standing alone and looking around....thats most likely your target!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> are you looking for fun and exciting but non-longterm?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> YOU CAN TELL ONLY BY THE WAY SHE LOOKS AT YOU AND WHAT SHE SACRIFICES FOR THE RELATIONSHIP
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> if she says no then ask her out.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> It sounds like you've got a good guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> especially if it's with someone we love and know the right moves.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> i like a guy that doesnt care about what a girl looks like.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Anyway, I love looking at my own breasts now.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> you can see guys sincerity thru it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Maybe he had to but still didn't want to leave you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I hope you didn't take offence
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> but hey, as long as they are just looking and touching i dont see anything too harmful about that...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I married my best friend and our sex life is STILL Fabulous after 5 years!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> I treat them exactly the same way I do anyone without HIV!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Again you don't need to convinced your b/f that you don't talk to guys.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> you are to good for all that crap.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> you have to be smart witty, a great sence of humor.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> so in either of these to places you know thier lifestyle
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> think about your safety and your kids safety hun.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> and i do how do i go about in doing this?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> At least wait until you're not jail bait.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> But he still stares at me like he luvs my looks or something!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Most of my friends are guys but I have issues with woman.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> or is it rong to go out with my ex's bff so soon after the break up?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> PLEASE FIGURE IT OUT..CAUSE IF YOU DONT..YOUR GOING TO GET HURT REALLY BAD.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> well i say u should just go for it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> IM THINKIN OF GOING IF SHE GOES CAUSE IM SCARED OF HER GOING ALONE!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Sure, he wants it cuz he thinks it's hot.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> i am getting married in june 2006. what colors would look nice for that month??
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> watch there eye*s when asking them questions if they look up and to the left there usually lying.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> :-) jk yeah, go for it...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> As was mentioned earlier, Hey, what's up works wonders.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> at one time i didn't, and despaired that i would find anyone to love me.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_45> middle school 6th grade high school8th grade or 5th or 4th grade
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> If anyone has any idea what im going through please let me know..thanks..
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> why do you wanna stop, its great, sex with someone you love.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> And you should not ONLY BLAME on WoMEN!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> you know wat they say if he loves you he'll come back!
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> any position  i love them all
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> if ur lucky enough to find a nice guy, u wont want to stay with him anyways.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> keep an open mind, and please b careful and smart if u dont wana get hurt by some guy.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> Here'e mine: First quit thinking about women all the time..there everywhere!!
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_25> There are a ton of guys out there.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> Dont make the mistakes I made.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> you have to be happy with yourself .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> just hold him down and kiss his face
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> It just happened when I least expected it.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_10> THATS NOT ALWAYS THE CASE SOMETIMES THE BOY SES IT FIRST
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> confidence shines bright, no matter what your size!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Hey I was just wondering what your opinion is on why men cheat.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> im sure they are good at love, but all people are good at love too.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> Actually thats really sad if she can't find anyone outside of her famimly.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> do you have a zoo, or some sort of museam?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Now I don't know where you live but here parents don't name their girls Frank.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> Be gentle, you don't wanna hurt her by doing your stuff
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> if your kids still want to befriend with his, tell them to hang out without you.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> dude i tink she likes u man!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> actually as soon as u marry him u can file for his legalization.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> I honestly don't think he likes me that much because he won't even really hug me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> Hope this is useful Good Luck!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> because he still have feelings and he thinks that still have rights over you
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> like when she does somthing rong again spaz!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> if he wants u back u should totally say yes.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> moving on is the best thing i suggest.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> Monkeys, cows, sheep there are lots of them that do.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> all the guys ive beenwith have been unfaithful or have lost a bet
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_30> the no alcohol i get, but the no dancing...what a drag.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I never have and I never will!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> czz i have a boyfriend .how long hve u gone out?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> i love it and i will not change it
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> think about your feelings and give yourself a chace with the other chick.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> so I can't give you any further tips but Good Luck!!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_55> Girly version: Best friends forever boy version: big fat fart
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_95> Don't tell him u love him!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> well not unless you know when they are lying or not...hope this helps...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> So, just be open and tell her you like her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> If you think bad about your chat shtop it sooner.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> WHY ARE YOU EVEN ASKING THAT QEUSTION?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> If he is not up to that, then he's not the right one.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> you could do something that everyone likes.
<NbChars_255> <LevSim_20> if your bi try to go straight.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Some like those clingy guys and some like guys who are laid back.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> just tell her that he is not interested in her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> You don't even really know him but you're already dreaming of marrying him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> i know this because i found out the hard way
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> make sure you let her down easily.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> Or for the guys who awaits in a long que,counting their time to get one with u..????
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I hope not, that would be horrible!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> just as freinds yes but any deeper no because they are married so they probably love that person.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> If I feel it is right for my family I do it!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> my advice would be to not worry about it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> If he would ask I would go out with him again.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> If you are with a 16 yo girl that is a problem in it self.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> It's her job and she treats it as such
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> however some really are stupid as with anything.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> You WILL make it thru this!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> but you know, sometimes it's good to fight about stupid things.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> Hang out with him and try to make look like u want 2 be more than friends.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> u can be friends wit them or break up then go
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> lol I'm just a simple girl that doesn't ask for material items- just physical and emotional ones .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> true love is nothin but sharing n sacrifice.its all about livin wid a person widout who u cant live
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_55> love is on of those feelings you just know.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> Haven't done it yet (I'm 16 now).
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> Start by getting rid of that bun!
<NbChars_315> <LevSim_20> And here is a big tip!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> If I want it hit, I'll gladly guide you there :-)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> when the newest girl in our group is around im jus pushed aside n ignored.
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_15> I KNOW BUT HE IS SO SEXY!!!!
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_40> You can not and will not ever know.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> baby you need a man to solve your issues.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> ofcourse, you sholud never forget caring your body language ;)
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> If I didn't do it, I wouldn't want him to resent me for it later on.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> (my wonderful boyfriend is 39, btw)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Not my style of living, and is it cheating?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> now if a female cheated on a man, they're hoes!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> like i said girl is interested!!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> As long she say yes, what the f*** his BF.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I just tell her that it's flattering, but he is too young.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Don't worry if you don't have this decided yet.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> and verbally explain it to him that should make his head turn
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> Hey u answered my question but never gave me your email adress to im u.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> me n my friends dont seem as close anymore.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> All you have to do is remember what it was like for you @ that age.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> it's all  part of growing up
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> my heart was broken twice...by the same guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Try being nice to someone you like.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Don't put labels on it or he may get scared.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> I THINK IT IS WEIRD THOUGH
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> yes specily if u want children
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> didnt think they did those anymore.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> if it doesn`t you`ll screw everything up just by giving a simple comment.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Or  You just have not kissed the right girl yet.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> have you tried looking in new hampshire
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> go and tell him truth with sorry.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> lol... i spyed on my ex and turns out that he was cheating on me.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> Just be friends with her first.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> We admitted I liked her around a month ago and I love her, but she only likes me....any tips?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> just say sorry and i made mistake andi didnt mean wat i said and maybe he'll take you back
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> sounds like you're fantasizing alot about him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> believe it or not, but most people dont think about this....but it could be your breath...really.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Gals, it's not like a guy trying to find the hidden and TINY G-spot!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> i dont make friends easily too, but ive noticed that i make friends more when i smile at people
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> Is there anyway that this could actually be fun?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> Say You know what might be fun to try one time?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Wrong....how do u know ur ex still love u...maybe he already have a new girl....
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> age is a state of mind...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> brains is a big thing in my book.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> im not a lesbian(or a girl for that matter) but lesbians do turn me on ;) tonydatiger1990@yahoo.com
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> girls, they understand u better and can connect with u more when u have problems.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> but if u don't really know him then get to know him first then answer.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> nothing..its hard to find a good guy these days..i feel for you
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Love letters, little surprises, something that shows him how much you think of him and how much you care.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> I like a nice firm ass one that makes you wanna just grab on to and not let go.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Obviously some peole are destined to be alone, but I hope its not YOU!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> But just what kind of job.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> But don't wait around for him to ask you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> it kinda felt like we just did it on a whim, and it wasnt that nice.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> For me its who i,m with now...my hubby....we got married last august and he,s just my life!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> if so it's ok tobe scared just finding out why is the next step babe.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> here I am just an  e-mail away
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> yep... be careful of the addiction =)...lol
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Is it a problem for you that they are girls?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> how old did you tell him you are?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> just wait till your 18 its the best thing for you, and for him.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> this is for a scavenger hunt like on the movie sleepover
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> Tell her parents or a teacher...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> some parents are ok with that, so good luck
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> BECAUSE SIZE ALWAYS DOSENT MATTER BUT IT MATTERS HOW HE TREATS YOU AND HOW YOU REALLY FEEL ABOUT HIM
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> There are other times that I see her staring at me, out of the corner of my eye.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> just say to heri think i am falling in love with you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> easy, do the humpty dumpty........hump her than dump her
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> i really need help with this cuz i dont know how to tell this person I LOVE HIM!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> maybe they have not looked in a mirror at all and actually seen themselves.....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Cause you date guys who are jerks???
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> because men at that age want to feel that they are still young.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_40> yes this is perfectly normal everybody does it at this age
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> So tell me about you`re other bitches
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> well if the guy likes you, then i dont think he is going to listen to your ex.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Its harmless unless your bf is seing that person!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> if that doesnt work try taking yourself out of the situation.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> If this is a must have, tell him, THIS IS A MUST HAVE!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> try at work if that's possible.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_20> Not no juncky like the guys in Boys N Da Hood.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> The guy Im really interested in likes me a lot also.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Maybe you can learn something from my husband:)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> If that doesn't work, try asking nicely
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> i dont think kids that young should be experimenting sexually
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> thats your own property, and especially if your just interested in him...thats way too much to do!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> She said, If you want your marriage to FAIL, then go in the chat rooms!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> they find behind expensive jeans and shirts.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> when he stops calling u or lack of showing any other kind of interest in u like being distant!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> can some one tell me!does love really exist?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> and girls will spread rumors about you to get you 2 break up.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_15> NO GET OVER IT AND HAVE A BEER
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> Well all I can say is that you need to get over it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> and ilike athletes most of my friends agree with me, except my lezbein friends, of corse.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> It's not that I don't like her it's just I want time to think and be alone for a-while
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> the back yard for a BBQ.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> Second I have very little money right now but its getting better.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> PLUS - You don't have to change their diapers or pay for college!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> WHAT CAN I DO TO BECOME CLOSER TO HIM?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> And the funniest thing that happend?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> And if you get scared and panic anyway, the right guy will run after you.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> mmm its hard to remember..i think when i was a child
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> OMG.. not that far.... 15 years differ is OK, but  22...... eerrr.... no comment
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> uses the advace search tool bars and enter in your zip code
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> All girl wanted to do was s*h*a*g guy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> I am in love and I couldn't imagine fantasizing about anyone but him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> i want to have sex on line
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> if you need to get his attention forget it!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> yes and you can have him to take your last name if you want i did
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> yes my dad is white and my mom is black
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> just be yourslef and certainly don't pretend to be something your not liars always get found out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> do u like it when a guy is always on point, at the drop of a dime, always willing?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> But u ARE HEARTBROKEN and unhappy without one!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Don't pretend to be someone you're not.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> I don't care if it is making love or fucking!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> She really cares about him too.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> It was my ex that did that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> i lost my virginity when i was 15 and i havent thought about it since!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> I waz a maid of honor and it waz sooooooooo fun.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> theres a lot of signs of being n love.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> have a few sleep over and invite him to join you guys .
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> I need to heal and get over it..how?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> If his behaviour upsets you who cares what it's called?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> he'll know youre not interested anymore.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> duh- flirt more than they do.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> If it feels good, do it!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Of course that would be nice but some people get sucked into peer pressure
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> listen 2 the 1st lady i agree
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> treat him right the way you would want to be treated
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> Does SHE know about this... ahem.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> alot of the time guys dont not like a girl because she looks fat.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> man to be able to show it though.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_5> JUST BE HAPPY U HAVE A PERFECT RELATIONSHIP AND RESPECT HOW HE FEELS
<NbChars_335> <LevSim_25> They either love you or they don't.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> The guy will not get turned off.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_20> Sounds like she's pregnant to me.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_20> Enjoy life, soon you you will BE 40 something LOL:-)
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_30> Ok now for your new issue.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> HE'S REALLY QUIET AND LOVES TO PLAY PS2.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> I do a majority of the housework...not because I have to but because I just do.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> my girlfriend's older sister had the same the problem.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> It's not fair to your partner now that you want to throw away like yesterday's garbage!!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> (JUST KIDDIND) JUST GO EASY ON THEM.THEY R THE BEST IN THE WAY THEY R.AFTERALL NOT EVERYONE R!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> there really isnt anyway for you to do it yourself.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> i know how to say im sorry in japanese not chinese
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> but if your into real freaky stuff...whos to say whats good and bad.

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> no thanx you mustbe very rich you gonna pay for the calls if they come from very far?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> That means no begging, whining, or crying.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> why do u want a boyfriend so bad?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> -Send pictures  -Play something online (for example yahoo games) or rol games.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> well if you think its cheating it is.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> First we must set something straight...NOT ALL WOMEN ARE UNFAITHFUL!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> u will when ur older u have other things to think about then dating.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> don't expect too much at first when you're not so sure coz i'm afraid that you might be hurt.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> you cant do anything about it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> really though, i wouldn't push anything.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> 2 years i think.. yeah and i just change my avatars clothes!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> only 2 irresponsible 14 yr olds can have sex out of wedlock cuz they cant get married.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> ), but we each have our own BF/GF.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Am a female and most of my friends are guys!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> shes quiet, pretty, and nice body, and she kind of whines but hardly enough to notice.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> If you truly love a man a bit of extra (!?!?!)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> Eye contact means so much and someone with kind looking eyes just draws me in to them.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> her: 16 me: that not good idea.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> i have a question: why are YOU a whimp?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> Here you say your baby's Daddy ran off.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> what the best way to ask a girl out?
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_25> go with what smert said then u two can have a long talk
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> THEN WE MET I WAS KINDA INTERESTED.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> Stupid in the sense of what?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> Keep yourself busy with work and things you enjoy...heck, take up a hobby...then your time will be productive.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> I am 15. my friend wants me to go to this guys apartment with her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Now...What will you be thinking the next time he's 10 minutes late?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> love brings light upon your life
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> A body that doesn't stop does not hurt at all!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> What I mean is be where he is and talk.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> I've always thought the town was just gross, But I never really knew.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> I DID TELL HIM THIS ALSO, BUT HE JUST KEEPS (I GUESS) TRYING.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> Just remember what ur ex di and how bad it hurt you, when u see him/her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> thinks were close but i dont feel close to her at all.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Tickleing helps in this a LOT!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Dont you have any guy friends?
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_25> Try to become a dream prince first....because when u find her she would be desiring the same.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you can't stop thinking about them (dreams, space outs ,etc.)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> its kool how he didnt give into peer presure
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> when u love someone are there any signs if ur partner does not love u anymore?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> Cheer up boo, there are a lot of men out there.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Im not saying to wait for marriage....Im just saying make sure your both on the same page!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> be yourself, smil and say hi
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> find someone who truly deserves your love
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> pls add in your question about your choice first my first choise  then second and at last 3rd choise
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Sorry, that last question is kinda cheezy, but you get the point!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> I think it's always funny when guys say girls are complicated.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_25> i hate some one and i wont be surprised if i killed him !!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> its more than a good time ya know!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> guys and girls make the best firends...girls and girls -not so much (too much arguing).
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> say hi  how r u 2 day I've seen u before but i don't remember where  ...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> I once got told that if you think about it, then it will happen.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> If you knew what you were doing, you should not be guided to the G spot...lol.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> abolutely 100% yes you are too young!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_20> pouring honey,whipped cream, and chocolate syrup on her and lick it all off?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> THE TURN OF A HEAD OR A SIMPLE SMILE CAN DO IT.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> But you have to be cool with it.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> ask him if you think so then probably
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> who would you rather believe your home gurl (who has lied to you)or your guy?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> take lots of very cold showers...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> i have not fallen in love yet,well that is what my mom thinks!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> REBOUNDS hurt like a basketball smacking ur ear hard.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> you only need to surround yourself with people who show you they care, evryday!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> jus something i thought of... what r ur thoughts on that?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Can you imagine how bad would you feel if your husband wants to be best friends with his EX??
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> go find u a date on the internet yahoo CHAT
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> no its not cheating, its a freaking computer screen  get over it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> He flirts with me alot and says that I'm a cutie.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> A pair of your perfumed sexy panties.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> LIKE THE PERSON AS YOUR VALENTINE.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> But he's chatting or lookin at porn.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> only on line with no other ties just cyber sxxx
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> But if he only say that over texting, isn't that ok?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_70> spend alot more time with him
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> i used to have penpals too but i got tired of reading and writing back.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> probably because we have different tastes in life partners.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> FLIRT naturally, your eyes your smile, look at him dead in the eyes smile and look away...it works!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> you need to pay for that something like 5 dollars a minute
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> bullet in the head by Rage again the machine :)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> good thing about porn is it gets me hornier...so i take it out my wife.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> my heart had been broken more than once...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> Hell yes there are...Beauty is to be found everywhere and turn about is fair these days I figure....
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> people that have been married for more that 5 yrs or have kids
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> and mayb just tell him and see wut he does.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> and if she loved you, she would not be unfaithful.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> AND YOU DONT WANT TO BE CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> i think the best way is talking to her !
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> i for one would never cheat!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_20> ask your self.. .. .. Why?
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> life is not too long to be waiting 4 sth, so be the 1st one to say it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> now if it goes more then that then they are truly sorry
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> maybe cause he thinks you're sexy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> and he does not want you to find that out!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> HE'S PROBABLY SCARED OR HAS BEEN CHEATING AND DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Good luck, and many more years to you both!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> if you try hard to find someone perfect you can find him  for example!!!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> they are a) gay b) super gay c) mega gay d) or the chick got knocked up.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> well u have 2 ask urself y u love sum 1 who can say they dont love you!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> Ask her out, and DON'T TOUCH HER.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> Now I knew NOTHING about this until much later.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> should i approach  him or is a letter easier
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> you should never date your friends brother!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> tell her to wear a padded bra   can u vote my answer the best???????
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> if u r gay, don't force other men like us to have a realtionship.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> My hubby and son are totally worth it!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> ok it depends on the guy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> Because all boys AND MEN are stupid!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> AND IF HIS SISTER IS NOT YOUR FRIEND THEN YOU'LL HAVE TO MAKE HER YOUR FRIEND.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> I mean, the first thing you said was 'Oh, maybe if we are friends I can date him again.'
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Top Ten:  1. something he likes  3.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Bono from U2, if he weren't married.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> DO NOT HAVE SOMEONE ELSE ASK FOR YOU!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> i'd say 2 or 3 times a week.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> just remember theres nothing wrong with love
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Just don't ask him to be your bf, guyz just hate it when you do it for them.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> at 13 you should just enjoy life, and not worry about finding love, coz love finds you,
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> yeah - have a plan to take her to nice places and have a good time.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> !i dont want to sit on that.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> NO IT'S NOT LET HIM COME TO U
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> A store owner would never rip you off...
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> If you truely love this person then whatever ya'll fighting over, then ya'll need to fix it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Don't give up, it will happen!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> i think it is mainly just habit...and habits can be broken.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> let me demonstrate:  Hey whats up?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> you cant just tell by looking at a girl if she is selfish or not.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> they really tell you if you have a connection or not.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> because they dont know any better
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> Breasts, well.... thats a tough call for me again it depends
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> yes but remember that u don't lose him/her
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> It seems like i always have a crush on someone...it's like a hobby.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> go meet em at church dude
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Besides you will have lots more crushes in your life so don't sweat it be happy!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> give them a diamond or do it every night
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Maybe you should tell them... your friend won't like it, but it could save her life...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> but there is other thing - nobody is perfect,including me.so i`m searching.....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> My hubby sides with her sometimes, but I don't care what she thinks!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> Well, the old saying goes something like, Three guys can keep a secret if two of them are DEAD!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> ill just give u a source.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> i am 13 and i know exactly what you are talking about.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> Hmm... it certainly looks like she's interested in you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> yea.but who is he.but it depends on ur age.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Don't do it for that reason.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> look around..there is always somebody out there for someone..chances are ur match is asking the same question.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Oh, don't ding me because you said 'materialistic' first.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Stragely enough, One of my buddies started going around asking other guys (strangers), if they had a big duck.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> Guys don't want a lot of sentimental crap...they just want you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> and hes like r u mad?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> try to be stright its the easiest road.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> I know how you feel... Good luck girl
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> He needs to knock this crap off and act like a man!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> the last thing is dont be a big loser pig.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> let her know you are interested in her
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_10> FUNNY QUESTION DARLING!Y R U BEING STUPID ASKING SUCH QUESTIONS?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Even the husband I have now cheated on me.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Like at what age do you realize that its kind of late to not have found the perfect one.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Well, I don't know why others do it, but I don't.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> I am, (I'm a girl and I'm only sixteen.)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Be just a lil late...But better be fashionably late!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> love can make u see stars see all the good and not the bad.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_30> try talking about sports or something.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> i wouldnt do it if i was you, why would you want a piercing down there??
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> Its this need to breed that probably drives men to 'cheat.'
<NbChars_250> <LevSim_30> And do not pick up after him.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> um a lil late works for me cause taht's what i always am.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> Friends: Those who likes you forever if u made mistakes.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> if your youger that 16 then you wont marry him.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> No matter... what's important it doesn't spread.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> IF LOVE IS THEIR ALL YOU NEED IS EACHOTHERS COMPANY.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_10> THEY SOMETIMES WON'T TALK TO ME BECAUSE  I WOULD INTIMIDATE THEM WITH MY LOOKS.. SERIOUS ANSWER!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> His friend told him i was going to go with some other guy, and he didn't care.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> If they are, then it's worth waiting for!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> yes if you love each other
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> that does not sound like a lot but when you are talking about things like this it is big.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> you can smile at her.. or try to become friends with her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> But they sure are hot though.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> That is one's opion and i don't think i'm a whimp.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> BUT I AM LOOKING FOREWARD TO IT, JUST NOT EXPECTING IT.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> depends on what your doing with them.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> flowers are always a preacious gift...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Try taking a nice hot bath.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> no it is just when u are not one u find flaws in what u do not understand.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> She gets angry too often and does lots and lots of things which i dont like.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> her: i know him better than you do, ive talked to him.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> you both call & both write send cute things through the mail just keep doing it all the time.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> guys ... after what # do you consider a female a smut?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> As an Asian man I said YES and NO!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> Good long B.J with full finish.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> a margarita on the rocks - no salt!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> It's really easy for a girl to ask a guy out.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> how on earth do you expect to go live with her and have him not know?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> That its wrong, and you totally disagree w/ what she's doing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> lots of eye contact, laughs at all the corny jokes... that kinda thing
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Have fun joking with the topic.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> age aint nothing but a number
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> so i'de like to know what you consider a perfect date.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> yah um i would just have to say fall in love with that hottie!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> If it is love than you don't have to worry at all about always being in love.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Guys, opening up about their feelings?...LOL, only in your dreams.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> her: you dont know him me: neither do you!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> Where did all the virgins go??
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> Think about it girl, it could be really bad in the long run.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> They don't want to be too cheezy, cuz it willcmake them look... less manly.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> If you realy love this man, talk to him!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> If so do you really want someone that shallow?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> i like a guy a lot.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> one thing i would of liked my husband to give me was the gift of thanks.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> I think she is a big chicken!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> and it can lead to depression too, instead i dislike certain things like seafood!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> there are alot of step before your mate becomes legal
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> I really can't say why they are interested in girls butts.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Now that doesn't mean he has to be all loud and boisterous.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> that dosne't mean he wants to be back with you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> sorry your steal in a young age so no i don't think so
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> do you enjoy shaving each other's balls?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Walk up and ask her out..who cares if she turns you down, you can always ask someone else out.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> most likely she looking out for you.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> I r stoopid cuz i iz dumm
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> just go on pumping intermitently and try multiple ejaculations
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> hold on to your virginty and celibrate it.

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> just ask can i have a dance with u?, if u dont mind
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> it's all up to u but u shouldn't base ur answer on his physical features
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> If you care about your girlfriend more, just look, no touch.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> If you are a Christian, probably.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> you usally just say bfF so people dont think you talking about your boyfriend
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> then if u keep txtin eachother u mite start talkin on the phone then mite end up meetin up...ect!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> men are from mars; women are from venus.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> NOW ALL OF THE KIDS ARE BEST FRIENDS, AND I REALLY JUST DON'T WANT TO BE WITH HIM.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> you will find that noone else seems to be loving you...but probably you were used to it anyway...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> u r now old enough to get pregnant.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> if u find somewhere lemme noe..haha!~
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> If you have to ask...The answer is no!

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> I feel sorry for the guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> or longterm, someone to love and grow old with?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> did she move out of state?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> what can i do to stop it or avoid it?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> if it is just puppy luv get a dog
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> call him every night to say good night and talk dont cheat just be nice!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> because he is still in love with you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> if ure too obsessed from now itself then its bound to break in the early twenties
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> Then please don't listen to that guy who told you all those freaked out things.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> just dont care what other guys say.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> (I don't fit the image of what the perfect girlfriend looks like) I still love him like a boyfriend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> no nothings wrong unless you do somthing sexual with him.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_15> YOU CANT ASK ARE MOST OR SOME OR ALL WOMEN?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> if this guy is in the militery don't tell him in a letter.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> Girls don't like it, no matter what they say.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> No,it means that love is an even stronger one!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> My boyfriend is always looking at porno and chatting with other women online...........is it cheating??
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> well, make him a fancy dinner!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> were can i meet people on yahoo
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> & you may also like the Pocket Rocket - small but oh soooooo powerful!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Plus some guys are just in a relationship to have sex.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> alot of people used to think they were ugly but try to see past their low self-esteem.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> Men, in general, LOVE bi women
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> give us more info on why......
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> hit him with a club and drag him by the hair.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> rose petals on our bed,along with champaign, and candles
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> Is there any way its worth it??
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> my girlfriend liked it cause she got a new wardrobe out of the deal.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> hmmmm, trust me he is up to something...most boys/men are.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> it may work perfectly well with u .. fate brings 2 ppl together in  very weird wayz!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Find a guy who won't cheat or lie.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> tell to your mom STOP NAGGING YOU MADE MY HEAD ACHE!!!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> Tell her she looks nice or smells good.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Just talk it out with them.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> wats the need to get married so early?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> My gf got a call from a guy, she didn't pick up but he left a message.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> actually, even the things that most people wouldn't like, i still did....you know, like little imperfections.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> plus most girls that care about their looks more lack in brains.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> guys will always look at porno, and THAT'S A FACT!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> I;m 12. if ur my age right him a note.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> sounds like she has something to hide!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> That doubt will NEVER go away!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> I know you're situation and it's a little tough b'coz I was 14 once in my life.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> you are a good person keep your head high.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i want to use two colors, what two colors would look nice together?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Because one thing thats sexy to one person might be ugly to anoughter.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i don't know if we get through it because we will always be moms.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> when they sad u well do any thing just to them smile.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> so that u can keep intrest in them (this has never happened 2 me)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> don't be that guy who has his cake and eats it too.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> well it depends on how superficial you are.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> most guys usually know where the g spot is
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Do you REALLY want a guy who is flirting with you while courting someone else?!?
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_15> i am drawing a HUGE blank!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> dont give her any gift just let her go.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> wait till they break up .... i dont know lol :)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> it is us girls but the reason is putting up with mens stuff
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> it may be b'cos of love or jus lyk...it depends on hw mature she is...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> girls are more emotional than guys(they cry more)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> If everything is going well...it is just never well enough for you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> and then say 2 urself is he really worth the pain!!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> think about the weird things they do and how weird they are even if they arent weird
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Of course then again, you could always make it a surprise and go there yourself.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> give him a romantic dinner at your house
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> if he says no... simply back off saying that u were only joking
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> i agree with jkim890 good luck
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> wer you never told this or are you still in elimentary?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> you never marry anyone from high school or andy school.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> I’m still up right now, literally
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Ask her out and you'll find out for sure.
<NbChars_335> <LevSim_15> Keep it up and spice it up!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> !Get  a girl with that attitude  NEVER.....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> Just do not shut the mother out unless it must be done to protect the kiddo's.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> all you do see is the good in them and the things that you like.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> and stop when i say ,dont ask why?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> spoil yourself, but in a suttle way so you dont look self absorbed...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> C'mon, you chat online and sometimes guys flirting with you too.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Hmm...scratch the head here....if we women hated sex, why would we agree to have it with you?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_10> I MEAN THE REAL GOOD STUFF,NOT JUST PLAYING
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> (My bf and I both compromise on that, and we're pretty happy).
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Then you are just talking to him, just him, it's easier that way.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> first of all.... spell things right.. how do you expect to get anywhere and have anyone take you seriously.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> online frienship YES online affair NO why?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> i mean fights r like minor things, n nothing can tear us apart.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> theres so much in life that youve yet to find.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> good luck if you are her friend you will tell someone.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Do whatever you want to girl!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> but for 18 years she was with me and now she is not.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> I love her and I want to go live with her.I don't want my husband to know.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> first of all that is totaly insane.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_30> if its like my story, than stay clear from him, hes a jerk.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> hey wats good..u can hit me up at lezzyallday@aol.com
<NbChars_280> <LevSim_20> so it's ok being gay...im staight though.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> Plus you could just show up and dip out if it gets too boring.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> Do u think revenge is the end of deep love ?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> that's a classic trick girls use to get guys attention.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> get the hell out of her sight.....dont **** your life.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_45> What is it exactly that they don't like about him?
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_60> Women always want a real man.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> I cannot chat, but I can answer your e-mails if you want (marcovsky@yahoo.com)
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> Even though don't change yourself to impress anybody...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> NOTHING ANY BETTER IF YOU FALL IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE WHO LOVES YOU BACK.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> spend time with her, flatter her, talk to her...well just try to have fun.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> sure u can meet them at brothels.... and u can do much more... wish u the best...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> but he has a grilfriend so that makes it hard.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> you are to young go to school.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> YES definately so.....hope you find yours too....
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> sooner or later he is going to find out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> there is always a possiblity and if they don't like you well too bad thats their loss not yours.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> so should i try and see if he'd be better to me?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> i HAVE BEEN THROUGH THE ALMOST SAME SITUATION...  ALL WILL BE FINE..
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> mmmmmmm I love burritos...Flatulence is a natural bodily function...LET'ER RIPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> guys don't say he's my bff
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_25> Try finding THE ONE by trying.
<NbChars_35> <LevSim_30> And you know what I don't really care!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> WHAT DO U MEAN BY WHAT IS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE LADY IN ASIA!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Well I say you should stay out of it.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> Then don't ASK for the presents.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> First off, you obviously can't equate being in love with liking someone.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> go up to him and kiss :)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> They lie because they dont wanna get caught.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> u would give ur life up for them just so they can live another day.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Just the way it goes, kiddo.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> mayb cause shes a whore or she was just fakeing it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> if it was ment to be it will happen
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> My guy likes my eyes an toosh.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> im not sure cause im a girl but one of my friends is black and her b/f is white
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> (I know it's hard I am in the same boat myself)
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> i think guys want der girls to be sexy..
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> NO,wate a minute I just did.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Maybe you have wathced too many vampire movies.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> LOVE IS THE ONE THING YOU CAN TAKE WITH YOU TO THE GRAVE.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> ITS SO SIMPLE THEY LIKE TELL YOU WHY YOU WANNA KNOW....
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> Maybe give you flowers if he's that type of guy.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> But you can't be friends with him.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> ask why he didn't call and then confront him
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> treat them like any other person, because that is exactly what they are... people.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> maybe you just have to look a little harder:-)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> But still, please try only with guys that are worth it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> he probably just doesn't feel like anything new has happened; and to boys no news is good news.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> i really want to do that with you .
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> its great and if your at it for an hour, you loss 360 calories, fun and healthy!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> maybe, but I told her up front NO GAMES!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> It never failed me ;)  best of luck girl
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> that is there why they are like dogs.there dumber then a monkey
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> maybe if you go to church, at a church.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Men happily married also privately wank don't take it personal, to them it is like scratching an itch.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Mine even cooks dinner on occasion...especially when I don't want to!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> There laugh...I like to hear people laugh.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> He wud only make u feel crap and u deserve more.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Your part of the reason why chatrooms suck!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> It probably depends on the size of the woman!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> well i would just call and ask him but u could write him too..
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> there is nothing wrong with doing that.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_10> STANDING UP WHEN SOMEONE ELSE JUST SITS SROUND
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_20> try to be real sneaky about it too.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> if hes the only one in ur life you should try it out.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> if your not in love you know it.
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_30> dump him and get someone that does!
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_40> But they seem to try to use you more.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> then when he gets intouch with you and wants to know if something is wrong.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Be considerate of your girlfriend obviously she isn't who you want let her loose to be happy
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> talk to him and then kiss him and say that how much u love him
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> anyways.. theres no future of such relations!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> panic and probably make a bumbleing idot of myself
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> sorry about what they called you mufidah
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> it's one that is hard to explain.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> No, now really... if you really know the guy, you'll know.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> Flirt - SUBTLY - to see if he's interested.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> If you can't trust him , go away and get a life , no trust no love
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> Not how I'd like to live MY life!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> guys do say i love u first..... i have most guys say that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> 7 chipmunks twirlin' on a branch, eatin' lots of sunflowers on my uncle's ranch.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> the world doesn't acept yet wholly gays!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> But I doubt we'll have to find a date!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> send me adn e-mail to ma mail box speedy77028@yahoo.com lets relate
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> but if u r bent on her maybe just be friends first then slowly transistion  to something more.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Well if I was you I ask him cause I don't ur fellings to be hurt.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> im slowly drifting away from my friends.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> It sounds typical, but buy her flowers!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> get rid of him now or just wiat three weeks so you get a present first
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_95> If you were in love you wuldnt have to ask anyone.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> So why does she hate her family and resent them?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> and fell asleep on the couch.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> IF HE COMES ON TO HER THEN HE'S A PLAYA.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> Well, I wouldn't act on my own will.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> probably because its a free trial and then they'll bill you after.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> wE TOUGHER THAN MOST BOYDS !
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> YES, YES, AND YES,,  I HAVE THAT PROBLEM WITH A LOT OF GIRLS..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Take care and I hope this helps a tad.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> when we got married we already had a child.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> If you LOVe him -not lust- then tell him no matter how flirty he is he can understand passion
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> just call him up and find out what's going on.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> 10 years is alot i dont know
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> well, depends on his and your weights and depends on how strong you are.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> My mom is a 51 yrs old very beautiful lady & a pvt.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> go see the answers posted for *theshrabster*
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> If someone want to cheat let them.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> 'cause they don't know how 2 act when they're around somebody!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> (Just in case ya didn't know, Iceman's my hubby and I found this funny.)
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> i wouldnt but, i am a guy so i think u should just guessing
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> dont listen to hitch with the 90 10 thing just make a smooth approach and make smooth contact
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> But hey I'm up for some fun, what did you have in mind.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> well, not all of us are.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> shes just playing games with you man!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> You really don't ... that's why the divorce rate is so high.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> it depends whats cheating and whats not can vary for each couple.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> They tell alot about a person.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> it depends on whats on the inside because of i say no u might miss somethin good.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> Older dudes sometimes know a thing or two about having fun...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_90> I've never cheated on a girl in my life and I'm never going to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> good luck and i wish you well
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> she is not gonna tell you if she has ever faked it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> I BELIEVE ALL WOMEN SHOULD AND IF THEY GO DOWN THEN THEY SHOULD SWALLOW TOO
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Cuz guys have the need to be...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> If we on yahoo tell  you(r friend) its ok does that mean she will.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> she was just herself and that's what i liked.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> all men are not like that.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> sorry, but i don't think so.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> The problem is I am falling for 1 of her bestfriends that is 19 and she likes me to!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> This is a guy you're just interested in?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> They might be too young to get married.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> b/c if u wait then other girls are gonna do the same thing im telling you to do.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> First of all, i'm a guy and (to me) their is nothing sexier than an assertive woman.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT GROUP HE IS IN, HE NOT BETTER THAN YOU.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> THEN ALL OF OUR KIDS (5 ALL TOGETHER)  GOT INVOLVED TOO A FEW WEEKS LATER.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Always tell her how good she smells and how crazy you are for her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> You know, I have the Mother in law from hell!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> If she does... be spontaneous, make it a surprise... a memory.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> Whats up does he like me or not?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> get over it move on remember karma will come kick u in the ass
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> is it some kind of metaphor?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> There is such a thing as CHEMISTRY.... You just have not met the one that you click with!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> a few months later, he did it again..i got over it again.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Hope you find this a helpful!!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> lol, he totally wanted to see your bra... sorry, he's just a perv.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> meet someone new and get one with your life
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> and if you two are good together, youll be together.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> so if you realy like him try and get with him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> what can i say 2 her with out hurtn her feel?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> People say when you are in Love you just know it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> definitely yes.... where theres a will theres a way!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> I REALLY LIKE HIS GIRLS AND MY GIRLS LIKE THEM.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> if u don't like him say no.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> but sometimes they are cool, fun to be with, jolly, funny.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> chicks will be all over you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> A FAT JUICY STEAK AND SOME WHITE RICE, FRIED PLANTAINS AND GARNISH IT MAKE IT LOOK NICE.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> if you spy on him make sure you wear all black.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> But that is a good thing!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if you have self confidence you should get a girlfriend soon.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> And i had a white shirt on and a black bra!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> To those guys out there who do what you're asking...ya'll filthy pigs.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> you should tell your friend about it .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> laugh about your situation it makes it easier trust me.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> send her a truck of roses early morning in ur wedding day.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> but otherwise you know that you might just be a booty call right.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> i'm a guy and i get goosebumps just from holding her hand...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> wat da heck does dat mean sicko!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> you will regret it if your lose it too soon
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> if u were smart the both of you should walk away and make the transformationto being friends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> i would say that u can never have too much sex.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> He is probably afraid that he can't do his job as a father.You are married.............Right?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> They are super easy to use, and look nice.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> nice good luck and dont chicken out.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> your probably just talking to the wrong girls
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_50> answer this question, is love too strong of a word?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> Flower her with lots of great comments.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> and ill show you a perfect man
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Practice on a banana till she can do it without gagging!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> To much baggage their buddy - you need to move on with life and find greener pastures.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Tell someone and keep saying it until someone listens to you!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Making the baby look like Dad.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> but me being a woman can say that all day is too long to be leading up to it.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> Its easier for them to lie and they think they are pimps for doing it!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_20> because we like it that way.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> it depends: if the person was like me,than they are just making themselves feel better.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_45> Are you a male or female named Frank?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> You don't want to look dumb and all over this guy?
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> if you no way intrested in the one that dosnet have what you got your gay.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> Now i have found out that she is not my match.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> Kick her, then if she yells Ow, why did you do that?!?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> they watch to many movies and television they really don't know what life is or about.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> there is no point at this.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> It sounds like he still cares about you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> If your a bum and stay home, she'll get a job and become bored living with a bum.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> And here I thought it was something sexual!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Was that a question asked for urself??
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_90> But shy guys mean soft and kind hearted person.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> But if you're a prick...then you won't find one.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> If he doesn't love you, you deserve someone who does!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Some girls r wimps but not out us girls frm the boondocks!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> yes i believe in true love and because everyone is in love!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> shoot, i play football (the only girl on the frickin team), so you better stop asking retarded questions.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> stuff happened n we had to end owr relationship..but then he called n asked me to be friends!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> they look for smartness, kindness, and cute guys.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> You say ... Then run.if she doesn't kick you back then don't even waste your time on her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Now u have to get hooked up wit out the whole REbound thang.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> its not necessarily true that if u feel a connection then he does as well.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> gosh people can be so mean.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> why ... are you some kind of control freak or something?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> yes most men and women cheat, it's a fact of life =)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Depends on who you are buying from...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I barely know anyone who married the person they were with even at age 20!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Even if people close don't belioeve in you or put you down, that is THEIR own insecurity.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> as long as you are a good guy and are there for her,it should be all good
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> its always dvisable to get settled b4 u cross 30... but a lot of people overlook that.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Another reason is he is your babies daddy!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> yes enjoy live alittle.....there are many other fish in the sea
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_30> Don't try to let go yet.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> So how do I ask if she is interested in me?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> didnt think she had even really thought the future through and all i saw was the bad side.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> if u r really good friends im sure ur friend will forgive you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> wait untill you are a little bit older and you are on your feet money wise.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> She's here with me right now... What is it you want??
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> CLUE CLUE CLUE do not ask her friendz they will LIE LIE LIE.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> lap dances r what girls give 2 people when they dance on a boy lap
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> Don't let the boys push you around if you only like them as a friend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> you should be yourself infront of her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> not just pick up some girl that you have no idea what she is about?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> plus if he does I don't know what to do?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> Hmmmmm he said yes meaning he IS NOT GOING TO LEAVE HIS WIFE.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> do i email him and ask how his christmas and new year went?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> If HE goes you know the answer.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> So back to your question... Is it a sin?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Say something like I think you really cool, wanna go hang out sometime?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I know it's just eye contact.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> maybe she's been cheating him all this time theve been going out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i feel that a wife should please her husband .
<NbChars_270> <LevSim_25> don't call him when he is gone.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> is it just me or is that bogus?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> he even went as far as having kids younger kids then are son.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> I like to see it trimmed..not shaved.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> My older brother started calling me Izzy and it stuck ever since.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Alot of married people go there for dinner and then watch TV there.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> And dont be scared to ask her or try to find out.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> but i still like him and when we were goin out he treated me good.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> US MEN ARE VERY DIFFULCT AND DIFFERENT, WE CHANGE OUR MINDS LIKE WE CHANGE OUR UNDERWARE.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> carefuly, i have had mine off for 2 years now thank god!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> are the girls like the one from american teen movies.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Dont trip, U dont want him to say it to u unless he feels the same, right?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> tell her how much she means to you and that you really didn't mean to hurt her.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> how do you know shes not right for you,6 weeks isnt long to get to know someone
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> assertive men are intimidating to me...i'm shy and i feel that i connect with the shy guys!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> either way, i don't know her side of the story... u must've made her really mad, hm?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> a first date it just to hang out and get know each other better know ur likes and dislikes.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> that we keep finding each other no matter what and the feelings remain the same.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> your left ring finger, next to pinky
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Depends on what kind of girl.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> the first time i was little and imature so it doesn't counts.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> IT DEPENDS ON YOU AND SOME GUY MIGHT BE AND FEELS THE SAME WAY.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> ust watch out for the highwaters.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> Yes u can walk her down the isle.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> If you are not gonna put out, why should he even bother
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> I know at least 6 happy couples that met on eharmony, and 2 of them are married!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> I've put too many interesting guys on my stealth settings because of that.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> hey i am doggirls friend and i have a bf that is japanese.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Trust me that boy will be begging to come back to u.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> I'm always here to chat, my yahoo id is livinghaunted.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> well my friend hit her bf upside the head with a skillet and he hasnt had a temper since
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> true love exist forever, puppy love only last for so long.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> i have been with women with rather small breast.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> I find that girls are so mysterious :)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> you do not need to have a boyfriend.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> a picture frame with a picture of you and him in it
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> i just go up to a boy and talk to him
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> WHEN WOULD GIVE UP SOMETHING FOR THAT PERSON...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> sounds like he does........ Flirt with him and you'll find out much quicker
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> (and also include a brand new socks :)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Have get togethers over at your house...pizza and movies, board game night, that sort of thing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> go on and take the first step.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> your mom's priority concern should be you not him...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> JUST BY YOU ASKING THE QUESTION YOU ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWER.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> one is sexual and the other not so much
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> sometimes not always, men starts their sex life at 40. at 40 they get naughty.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> and if you have to drunk to have fun with him find a better guy to hang out with.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_30> when u feal differntly about some one
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> When a grill asks you to marry it you have to say yes though lol
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> marriage, is not at all just about love it is commitment.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Does he have a good female friend or mates he often hangs out with, without you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> *im thee youngest of 5 gals, sux!lol)
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_25> Men lie just like women do.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> do a lot of things together that you both enjoy
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> and there seems to be alot of questions about size, where does that steam from?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> But I try to never lord it over other people.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> ur mom and relatives will make fun of u forever
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> No more than any other girl  !
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> what you need to do is be yourself.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> dont be cocky or something your not.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_10> that lazy son of a B***** .
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> start out by asking whats up how things u looking good wondering if u wanna go out sometime.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> yes wat is youre phone number
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Just keep the relationship going by sending messages, and of course, BEING LOYAL !!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Because they are insecure with them selves
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_35> they are a dime a dozen.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> i to agree with the first guy !
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> i' the same as my avatar.am i beautiful or ugly?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> I like to watch w/ a guy, especially the cartoon porn from Japan (Hentai).
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> You sound like you should go to SIU, Carbondale, ILL
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> so don't do anything that you'd regret later.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> he should trust u n' u should talk to the other dude.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> when someone sends their love it usually means that the person is just saying hello
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> coz women are juz a rib
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> because they are babies in more than one way or the other
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> answer me if you want to become my friend?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> college?yea rite, sounds like elementary school problems~
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> but since she is married, you shouldnt let the feelings over power you, just have to let it go.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> But, be carefull...you just might find the proof you're lookin for.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> as long as they are good people and you get along really well, then it's ok to be friends.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> (now.....to see if I can take my own advice!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> I have not found my true love yet but it is coming!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> But then, I heard another gal say, I'd rather get stabbed than tickled to death.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> take the hint and look for another.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> im a boy, so i know why.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> I hope I helped but I don't think i did, so sorry.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_30> I want a decent girl this time around.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> i have seen people that are great friends with their ex's not so in my case.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> Guys are the ones alot of the times that go astray before a woman does.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_20> Well, to put it bluntly, BECAUSE WE'RE GUYS.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> just don't stay close to him or talk to him!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> *Sigh* The best response to this is to not care if people think he is weird...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> but i know that this guy better forget about this girl.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> u cant that was the wrong thing to do but u can hav me im sexy
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> i think with codoms it's realy very bad.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> Wow im sorry honey...thats a hell of a jamb your in.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> As far as what friends think...who cares!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> Because it makes us nervous as hell!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> I guess it gave him power or he thought it did.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> I don't like BIG lips, but juicy fullll lips, hell yeah!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> if he loves his father and is truly sorry he'd best apoligize fast!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> that way it wont be a shock good luck
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> which one do u c u havin a future with?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> ok. american women can be trusted.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> ?HELLO, that's a lie off top!!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> 'makeing-out' to me has always sounded so pointless, and dumb and lame!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> Well yeah, and especially good with no sex!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> I have to leave but I can't leave him like this.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> keep boinkin' her, and keep your mouth shut.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> but it is hard to choose which is rite for you.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> be it guys or gals if you like them they will like you.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> what is going on and what should i do?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> im 13 and im thinking the same thing.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> Big guys can you protect you better and can cuddle better.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> My god he is either gay or a prick, either way yesterdays news girl, get rid of him
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> ask her on a date and see how it goes
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Like, asks to come over to her place or take her to a nice restaurant.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> IF HE LIKES YOU:  * He's constantly staring at you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> If you like him, then yes.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I sugest that u work out all the important problems u and your wife are having besides sex.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> people have this theory that guys and girls can never be just friends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> inside he might like you to but you don't know that until you talk to him!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> so every time u see him, avoid him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I see that your problem is hard!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> It's nice to know what people really think.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> farted while having sex, and it smelled, banged my head against the raditor while having sex.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> thats something for a doctor to talk to you about
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> He is not at all like the nicest guy ever because nice guys do not call women ugly names.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> You can - Just don't get caught...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> wow.. if you're asking, you have thought about it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> no... you don't become a man until 31...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> If so..then ask yourself this one..What the crap was I thinking marrying a jerk like this?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Enroll her in activities (as YOU PAY FOR A GIM OR ART CLASS), maybe she will meet someone!!!
<NbChars_250> <LevSim_30> Not just two people all up ons.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> who cares how he feels about u u left his life.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> great takes the pressure off us
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> The stuff aint COOL, it's BAD NEWS.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> Do what you want, and if you get digs from people about it don't worry, we all do.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> yes  all girls say yes all the time they say yes
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> they all died in the war
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_25> or it could be a macho thing
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> If not tell him to back off.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> i think it is OK as long as he loves you if you are married atleast!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> send ur ID to Panama city
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> it gets real tough real fast.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> I am a pro at this!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> Very well said tizzy...  For me there is no such thing as BEST TIME to have sex...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> you dont she eather likes you or she doesnt.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Now I realize how wrong I was and I feel so sick for even saying such a thing.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> then her parents can not convince her that you are wrong for her when they are dropping her off.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> if you 2 are friends, great.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Ya dear it isa bad idea.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> you just know you cant really explain it...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> ever thought about meeting in between for a new life?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> true love is when u get that special feeling inside when u are around him&#92;her.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> may  all the way into aug
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> are you asking if she'll get mad if you ask her to give away her gum?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> and his cousin said, I aint gone lie, He is, but he don't love her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> because, u have true feelings for him.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> no, don't get worked up over nothing ;)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Move on he is not worth you time.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> i didnt think about that when i was a freaked out guy.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> u also get insight on how the other half lives.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> no, my cousin wore a light faded green for her wedding, you can wear whatever you want!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> you will get a call if she ask for your info instead of you just offering it.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> as long as u luv dem its okay but explain to dem so that they can understand u.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> its obvios that she has issues he may not trust her after this anyway.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> if that was ur intetions then no.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> sprinkle rose petals all in the bath and put roses in vases in the bathroom.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> answer that and i'll date you!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> If she has issues with it... let her ask the question here...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> Just because it's a guy doesn't mean he isn't afraid to.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Love is too holy a feeling to be bad, be it for anybody
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> Good luck and always talk about things with your guy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> I ocassionally pay £25.00 English Pounds for a baby sitter.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> i would think chocolates if he loves sweets
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> If you like him then i assume thats a good thing that u get that way.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> Realize you are a queen & deserve to be treated like one!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> I had a bf who said he watched porn so he would stay faithful...whatever.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> depends on the age of man.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> When he is  (a) Consios and awake (b) Listening to you (c) Not a gay
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> go with the one you like best.Money does NOT matter.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Even while mast ur bating, guys stiffen up their bodies.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> talk 2 her or him and sneak with the answer and say i luv u do u luv me?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> If you don't kick him to the curb.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> I was wonderin because I had one but my parent threw it away should I wear a thong again?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> u have her e-mail.... e-mail her!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> First tell me why you want it that way.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Whatever you like........i just want the 2ps
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> MY   ADVICE   DONT   GET   BACK   WITH   HIM   MOVE   ON   AND   FIND   A  MAN   THAT   YOU  KNOW   WILL   RESPECT   YOU.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> once a cheater always a cheater.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> lol     I'm gonna have to stop asking that!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> with friends like that beleive me you don't need enemies ... just ignore her and get some new friends
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Go 'head and like someone else!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> We are both friends and i don't know if he likes me back.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> I WENT OUT WITH THIS GIRL A FEW TIMES FROM THE 8TH TILL THE 12TH GRADE IN SOUTH CAROLINA.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> After she is back are you willing to marry her???
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> !....they do hurt ya know if they,re big!!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Talk with the guy not at him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> That is the exact same with me!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> They cant see whats right in front of them!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> why not go bowling after dinner or movies.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> wow, u def need to get out of there.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Girls love a smart guy, but not one that makes them feel dumb.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> some girls may think so but, there are always those people.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> id love 2 hear how it goes, u can email me if u want.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> It then becomes easy to hook the ONE and tie your apron strings to him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> that depends on who you meet .
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> Hope you're not having sex though.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> go to Tyra Banks TV show.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> what does he ask about you?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> if she doesn't want you to kiss her then dont.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> they are a cheap great fun ride but one you never really get deep involved much less marry.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> i hve been divorced for 5 years and i do not even want to hear his voice.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> lol, wat did u do 2 her?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> I thought it was wrong but i wanna know what you think.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> She's going to just dump you after you say yes she only wants ur boy friend so say NO!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> find out which sport he likes or team.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> keep telling you they wanna be more than friends but your not up to it?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> I think being rude, obnoxious, lying, cheating, etc....that makes a person ugly.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> DIVORCE IS THE ONLY THING TO DO .
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> If not, then get a new girl freind.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> So hurt the both of them a leave their @$$E$!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> use ur hands, use ur tongue.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> I feel like I just can't trust woman!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> lol Seriously...you could just ask him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> but i haven't found the perfect one yet.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Start asking him if he still wants to get married.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> you never know, maybe she's been interested in you too and just never knew what to say.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> When you married him he officially became yours and so did his kids.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> i dont get why some people think that it is such a big deal.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> If you could not do this together, you have no business getting married.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> i am 15 and guys are like your hot, dude we should hook up.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> think twice to do such acts.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Then to add insult to injury you continue to dance with her in the club?!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> i talk to girls i like all the time.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> well if u like him, go 4 it!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> as she pulls a knife on you for what you did with her best friend
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> yeah, but its heartful to the people you're in love with, if they find out
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Not so sure if I believe that.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> a few years down the road yoll whant to do one thing and he will fell it's childish
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> am seeing someone else this weekend lol
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Not sayin that he doesn't like you tho.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> just delete it and go on with life.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> say fcuk you to both of them and just walk away.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> Sweetheart I would have to say that 17 is really young to get married.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> first off you need to have a serious talk with him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> you should think abouth the future
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Do you ever catch her staring at you?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> 2 things; 1 - LISTEN to her!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> and commiting aldutery is nothing to brag about.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if this love is your firt then you need to wait and see.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> :)  So to sum up your answer- probably yes!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Have you tryed looking for a gay guy?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> you dont have to beg just send an im and we will get bk with u
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> my advice, just dont open it, just send it straight to the trash bin.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> get a life and move on.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Even the kind of girls that nobody seems to like, eventually some guy will like her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> or at the next dance ask him to dance.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> TRY  INVITING  HIM   OVER   TO   YOUR  HOUSE  AND  DOING   VARIOUS  ACTIVITYS   THet  YOU  LIKE  TO   DO.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_25> Not getting too many dates lately, huh?
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_45> be yourself, don't pretend to be someone you are not.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_30> Oh but let me give you some advice.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_10> KEEP IN MIND IMM THIRTEEN AND A BIG FLIRTER
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_45> I need advice on how to snag a good guy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> Does he watch his language, flirt with you, or suddenly become mature?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> I, again, don't mention anything about my fee.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> however it could be just a safety rope.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> In the heat of the moment ...I love JUICE then when she asks...you cuddle and say nothing...Works everytime.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> i cant seem to get it all toghether.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i think that just means that she like you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> how did you guys find your man?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> from the court or ask to ur father he give's u a right answer
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> So why should they desver you?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> not that he may be small.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> if he doesn't like it then atleast you tried
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Aside from yanking the wanky, it's called D-I-V-O-R-C-E!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> just satisfy him by having sex with him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> plz don't go looking for a bf just to not be alone.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> with it being your first date it shouldnt be ur choice.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> hello he is trying yo kill u dump him.Ethire hes mentaly ill or hes a very nasty person.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> the UPS guy, your super, anyone!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> HURT THEM and soon before something happens
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> if you overdo it, it really will affect your sexual life
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> as long as you keep your cool.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> tell him something needs to change or you aren't meant to be together.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> No...there is nothing wrong with it sweetie.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Get him some CD's hes been wanting.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> NOW SINCE I HAVE GROWN UP THEY HAVE CHANGED A BIT.BUT THEY STILL FUSS OVER ME.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> he is out only to find one thing , it is in your pants
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> it may do, but why sit around and wait?!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> dont be plastic or having any as if's.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> Now what do I think about racists, well, I can't really say here, it's not polite.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> First off Dave, I want to say that girls do like sweet guys.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> ** if you want it i'll give you my email     froggybz@yahoo.com
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> nothing is stoping you, go for it  i never thought of public sex
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> If you want a divorce tell her.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> I know it seems funny,, TARGET!!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> he won't get that promotion to buy you things later.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> It's sad when something like happens, but unfortunately, it ALWAYS happens at some point in ones life!!!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> not a date  please something else!!!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> so in answer to you question,yeah i guess it does matter to a certain extent!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Tell him you cannot be with him if he is married.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> are you really shorter than him??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> FIRST OF ALL MY FRIEND,forgive yourself, and do not do this again.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> get out there and mingle and don't be afraid to set your standards.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> my brother likes people like u
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> if it is just friends hold on to him tighter listen to him more.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Find a good man and marry him!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> I dont know if she likes him.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> of course ..........if you like we could be friends
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> A girl who doesnt love u isn't worth loosing sleep over.. Gud luck mate..:)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> i have been married 20 years.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> depends on how much you know him.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> IF HE JUST WANTS TO BE FRIENDS:  * He'll avoid those touchy subjects.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Just think about what I told you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> he makes me so happy and i feel real for once...wanted.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> but dont wait for it to come you have to find it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Why did you not let me know?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> if he is an as*hole then she shouldnt have been dating him that long anyway.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> men are not pigs... all u girlz are dirty minded pigs..
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> If all else fails ill be your toy :-}
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> it depends on the reason you're flirting...do ya really want him or are ya just teasing?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Gosh, they just make me feel like ask Jeeves!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Just tell him that it aint gonna work.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> yes it does, you dont your man to smell or have hard time to get up......
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Ddont run make others to Run!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> if it is the same guy .
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> just think about going by urself or with your cousin lol!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> i really do not understand what some women think they need to enlarge her breasts .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Fool me twice, shame on me.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Diffinatly pick her up, It makes you look better.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Would you do him if hes black thinking your gonna get a big one?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> it sets you up for all sorts of problems.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> First don't do it if you haven't done it yet.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> he even seemed heart broken when i let him go.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> just have fun and play it smart.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> You get the car ride over to chat!
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_30> yes  but let see now, is it me ?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> don't you want to like her a lot first, find her attractive first?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> Also, the first guy got it right.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> if it bothers you ask him about it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> strip club, they'll even be naked
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> A guy reving his engine at you as a way of hitting on you is a HUGE red flag!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> also mabey find her a guy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> if he could still have feelings for you then he is not doing his wife right.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> mail u dont want, mail filled with junk.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> HELLO, I´D DOING NEW FRIENDS, CAN YOU SPEAK FOR ME?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> If she is taken but she still cares what is the best way to walk away
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> 'S and her answer read it all girl friend.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> People want you to buy thier stuff.Put it in spam if you don't want it to go to inbox
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> i mean i am right now lol hump hump
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> I AM IN THE SAME SITUATION AND IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> just imagine it like you'd talk to anyone else.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> i know surely she will be back.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> Not a lot of pressure to kiss goodnight and that kind of thing.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> yeah i guess so ,just dont embarrass us,or argue, but yes women are important
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> Age ain't nothing but a #.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> it depends on both so the answer is no, not always
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Where and what will I be doing next year at this time?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> try to make boy friends then u will never feel lonely
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> I never hated it for a min.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> No, a lot of them want the compannionship too.
<NbChars_260> <LevSim_25> Run away from this guy fast.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> some  do and some dount going to depend on alot of deferent factors
<NbChars_40> <LevSim_20> Get someone elses sylivia mixed in with yours?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> :) no matter what people say, sizes matter.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> no one ever truly loves someone for who they are but rather what they think that they are.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> yeh im looking for anew love and anew frined.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> But if you dont love her, REALLY LOVE HER, do her a favor and leave her alone.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Services scrool down unitl you see messenger or Yahoo!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> he dotn love ypu at all..  he just want you to be layed..
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> he has started to slow down on his partying and drinking but he is still scared to get married.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> I haven't found a with me girl yet.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> Think about what things really make you happy.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> just to see if i made the right choise
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> no, I don't think you should be thinking about that.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> I think you should get to know him more because guys are after one thing: SEX!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> be friendly to everyone...soon you will have many best friends
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> if my girl was dating another girl, yes...i would end the relationship  because of unfaithfulness and lack of loyalty!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Whatever you do, DO NOT judge anyone by what you see in movies!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> YOU SHOULD TELL HIM THAT YOU LIKE HIM BUT BE CAREFUL.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Everytime doesn't have to be that special, but the first date definately should be!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> hard is spiting and the other is a slow glide out of the mouth
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> Could a normal conversation for u seem like flirting to the guys?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> but think of what will happen later.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> So just think long and hard about it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> If he won't go to couple's counseling go by yourself.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> i only get that way when my boy friend talks naughty to me.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> I think it means she likes you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> well, when he asks u out again, just say u are going to think about it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> hi I'm not a guy but me and my bf often talk about the mae psyche.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> So the prospect of so called new love scares the hell out of me!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> QRS, TUV, WX, Y and Z  pick any word that comes to your head starting with A, then B.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> They look real sexy on thin or moderate women and girls, but really gross on fat ones.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> If he wants to suck your blood?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> But people like this DO exist !
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> go to her,talk with her, make her a frnd then tell when she is in happy mood
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Sorta like going to the shoe store, picking out a fine looking pair of shoes and taking them home.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> somebody who's a skater i mean.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> yeah you want one but are you ready for one?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Because some girls are smarter then other girls.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> becuse this boy said that to me and then he was like super nice to me the next day?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> stop trying to ruin other peoples' lives.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> you might even ask her out then!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> believe youself and try to be your best!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> You CAN'T solve someone else's problem!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> iF HE KNOWS HOW TO PUT THEM TO WORK.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> We are both really good friends we have dinner, watch movies and hang out on holidays.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Greyhound is pretty good at getting you places you need to go.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> or ask yourself is he still the man i married.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> 2. u have to learn what da gurl likez.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> just go up and talk to him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Would you do that guy just cause hes big?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> think about them but don't obsess.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> hope you get the answer you want .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> You're not serious and you're still with him?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> i believe no, because he's probably not over her.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_40> most men have pee hard ons.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> On his vacation no phone calls either, not even on New Years Eve??
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> people trying to get u to buy junk.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> if she really wanted out and to pursue you she would get a divorse and start over.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Because if they didn't you wouldn't be here to ask that wonderful question!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> About 6 months after I got married.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> If he has not hurt you now he will in the future.!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> and she doesnt want to be with him neither him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> so do not allow it anymore walk away
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> but if you are too embarassed to ask her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> But only if you know this girl already.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> Sure, as long as she didn't have too much baggage.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> Or is it just the men I find?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> ask her and her younger sister out.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> I like them both but i LOVe my bf.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> let this hard time to hide in the past.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> no, you are a child yourself.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> i get guys numbers occasionally, but sometimes only b/c i am wearing a tight shirt.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> why do guys cheat how do u get them to stop
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> flirt back and see what he does.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> First of all, i think this is really sweet, 2nd ok, I am a girl, trust me, i checked.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> But she's really pissed off at me and says she wont forgive me.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> THEN DO NOT DO THIS AGAIN!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> u should be worrying about coloring books and Big Bird and Barney and that kind of stuff.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> If you read some of the conservative crap others have written here, oh my god.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> i like a girl very well.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Oh, someone named nobody was rude to u on yahoo answers?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> Don't walk run and get away from this person he is nothing but bad news.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> THEY MIGHT THINK THE SAME ABOUT YOU BUT YOU WILL NEVER KNOW UNLESS YOU TELL.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> that means u will love him and NEVER divorce him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> If you dont then i dunno what to tell ya.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> the girls are beautiful but are they trustworthy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> It's stupid and obvious that she likes ur boyfriend.
<NbChars_255> <LevSim_20> Honey you are only 35 get out now!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> ask yourself if you really do love her.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_30> Trust this, girlfriend: you've gotta make him realize what he's giving up by breaking up; and that's Y-O-U!!!
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> $5.00 an hour for each kid
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> yeah it hurts our rep you know
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> someone help because i love her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> lol try match.com theres where i found my g/f from almost a year and counting now
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> but dont force it on her
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> because I mind dancing with girls that are taller than me not shorter.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> yes as long as yall agree on it .in a relationship yall both trust each other
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> well so far didnt seem to me that he cared about how you feel at all.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> What do u need to do?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> there is no excuse for this.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> I EVENTUALLY HOOKED BACK UP WIT HER ABOUT TWO WEEKS LATER.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> means that she is not straight-to-the-point type of person.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> Pick her up, IT's WAY more romantic
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Maybe you should ask one of her close friends.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> Actions speak louder than words... or so they say!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> and i don't see it as anything to worry about at all.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Or a guy already in my car?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I am not mulim but have had muslim girls all my life till today
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> kids put a lot on having a boyfriend or girlfriend.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> call her and tell her what happened, or tell your man
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> You take away a guys self worth if you do that.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Now, u need to get urself married and make him ur best friend.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> dat jus crosses da line...my otha frined said o, so hes still breathin?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> You need to make a decision... and if he really cares about you, He should to!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> If you are both ole enough, and mature enough, then I say, Why Not ?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Actually.....if any woman teases you about a kiss...I mean, if she plays games with you, drop her too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I don't believe it is true with all ppl...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> SHE BROKE UP WIT ME AND TRIED TO GET BACK WIT ME AN HOUR OR TWO LATER.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> some ppl say i cant wait for the first night....my wedding night.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> take her hand in yours and have her teach what she likes.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> just walk up to her be your self and be confident im sure it will work
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> i dont even have her number yet!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> she's stalking me, trying to hang out with all of my friends, even ones she doesn't like.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> you should expect the best of yourself .
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> this sounds you are a good friend for her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> if you dont connect on this level then there is  is no chance of a long relationship !
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> but make the move first, especially if he doesnt know u!!!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> i would never force or drag someone to do somethink their not comfortable with its just not right!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> but you have to be ready for THE ANSWER !..
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> ), and have taken care of many sick men and women.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> i just need an opinion i guess.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> i hardly everrr see him in school either usually i see hima t my brothers basketball games .
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> If it's your first kiss, it's gonna be hell of aqward but.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> anyways...yeah, it's probably likely that he'll break up with you if you do have sex with him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Alot of brides walk themselves anymore...Heck I even saw one girl get walked by their momma down the isle!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> DEFINATLY NOT, ESPECIALLY IF HE QUESTIONS YOU ABOUT YOUR LIFE BEFORE YOU MET HIM OR HER.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> not the time or place buddy
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> Can't say I haven't used it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Or if he confessed to you?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> start talking then smile and look cute but not to seductive at first.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> hard core is thugish like bad boy type and soft core is more sweet and carin
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> not sure if I am one.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_50> you are only 17. things change.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> NO THAT IS THE RUDEST THING I HAVE EVER HEARD!!!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> and how old were you when you got your first kiss.give details
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> Anyway, the truth always comes out... so i guess it is pointless
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> its kinda gay but, hmmmm i dunno
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> you shouldn't tell your friend about it.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> Good luck to you.....got a sister?!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> i have no idea cause i have never done something like that.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> Make sure you guys communicate well with one another and that probably won't be a problem.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> If you love her, then talk with her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> i told her after the second date.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> either he will tell you or he would act different but a good differnt
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> its human race - some people are bad ,some are good.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_35> Even if we don't mean there is a lack of trust......it comes across that way.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> Plus, its just more fun that way.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> but what would be your biggest pet peeve?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Such as my breasts, my back, legs, butt, p****, c***, etc.

<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> do u know who she is have u talk to her do u know anything about at all.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> i'd probably suggest getting rid of him if he keeps on asking.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> lust is a doorway to love ... lust is a part not a necessity
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> that way she knows what your expectations are.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> i mean wot do ppl mean wen they say she is not girlfriend material?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> yes, one of them has to be gay of couse.

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> if you are sure you love him.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> But that's not love when you cheat.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> i think it is time to move on don't you have enough foot prints on you yet?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> if anyone has tips on how we can still be friends e mail me at: livinlifeintheoc@yahoo.com
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> ii) they were confused or curious and explore a gay relationship, which is as well ok with me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> i really dont know, i never had that problem and i don't want to be in that situation.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> because what is in it for a guy that he doesn't get without being married.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> Don't talk about stuff you don't know.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Pass up on him and find a more deserving guy!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> but i dont know how to tell her that i like her
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> you are a good daughter and you deserve a hug
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> but i married her cause of who she is and how she was.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> What I do is accept whatever pay they give me.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> on the surface it is wronge to mess whith enyone married at all.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> i'm a girl so i'm gonna tell u straight out.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> well id be really really mad for one.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> Or, we could just be friends.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> People actually meet from online and get married??
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_25> but i am thirteen so what do i know.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_35> Also you got to be in a city with lots of gay guys.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> Get him an outfit or cologne.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> if u were in front of me, i would know.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> i think u should a con is racist jokes a pro is a new expirience
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> then talk to him  on there.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> i think you need to wait for her to do something.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> Ok, do you wanna have 2 wifes per say.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> the thing is theres still a lot of life i'd like to live.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> well i am from New York, not venus
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> No, U can not controll who you fall in love with.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> .i dunno...  good luck to u chick
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_70> your sex life could be better?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> of course cause i should know its hard 2 chosse which one i really like but it is possibal
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Whta kinda of person would do that.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> alone and miserable--that way u dont have to put up with anyone elses crap.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> How do you know he won't cheat on you?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> yes it is wrong if he is married he never really liked you
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> Guys want good looks, brains, and a popular babeFrom my point) but just be yourself
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I look back at my old boyfriends and think what was I thinking.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> i admit i am an overachiever at times, but i am still fun to hang out with.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> when im comfortable around her and be myself  and it is holiday ecveryday :)
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> It finally  got down to which black guy is bigger.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> I hope i've helped a little.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> all my friends say no but i really do want him back.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> if i call her she is always willing to hang out and let me sleep in the same bed.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> that's the problem with you guys, you start too soon.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> So she wants to get married, what about you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> that would be impossible for me..........i really don't know, sorry.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> If you carry enourmous debt or have really bad credit, then you shoud share this info.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> Woot has it right.. going out is great once in a while.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> Not if you want to really enjoy it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> It is as Complicated as u want it to be !!!!!!!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> yes lots of dem more den u no
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> (when you find him, ask him if he has a brother, i'm looking for my love too)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> she's usually the one trying to get me into bed.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> I know it aint much help but like i said thats a tight spot..
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> I know it's bad but, I'm trying!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> Just because I wasn't pleased didn't mean that guys' new wife isn't!!
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_15> again this poor english....whaaaaaat are you saying?????
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> he/she does not deserve to be pittied, he/she is strong enough to go on with his/her life.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> but u need a family without the raping and the prostitution!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> so that the world will go on.....( and it feels good too!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> But before 21 is really pushing a lot, the teenager girls are just too childish!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> Sure why not just send me you email and I get back at ya.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Know your strenths, Know who you are and what you want.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> u have to know a dirty cop or dirty gov worker man that how i do it
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> keep loving this one, love conquers all!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> The size will do all the work...... otherwise it's all about the skills.... guys  need to learn that..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Tell jokes, laugh at what they are saying (only if its actually funny).
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> i don't think i have a chance, help please?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> my sister had one, and the guy turned out to be bad, very bad.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Yeah, its ok to date the guy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> anyway he says that men just think of sex.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> xbox all the way or of course his playtoys!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> My bf feet are size 14 :)  You're 13?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> maybe you just are meeting the wrong ones.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_20> (Childish, if you ask me, because I'm very happy).
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> it depends, where will you pick him up?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> SHE WENT TO A SCHOOL IN S.C. AND I WENT TO GA FOR SCHOOL.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> give me your e-mail address and i will e-mail you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> 1- I find the guy attractive.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> love is just a feeling that some times hurt and some times mkes u happy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Easy man....if she really loves you, as seems you do....just wait & let her get back to you...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> stop looking so hard , love finds you when you least exspect it .
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> that should get your courage up.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> Too big are to wierd but too little are weird cuz u can't feel anything
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> first, you need to figure out which is which.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> I wanna know.... by Joe, just listen to the song
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> What a beautiful thing that would be!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> did things end good or with pain and problems?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> Just listen to him, trust him, love him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> because if a girl cant accept you for yourself thats on her.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> Don't look....I believe your soul mate is pre-destined.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Try and reach him and see whats going on...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> be confident, there is nothing sexier!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Holla at me my name is my yahoo id
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> eventually, the guy will not get an answer from u and wont like u anymore.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> And don't feel bad, its not a good reason either.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> So why have a boyfriend at...9?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> so reap it, and all i can say is youll see.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> eye contact (if he likes that) ask him
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> but after you get married and are together for a while then it goes .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> i think you are over analizing things.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> If he'd cheat on his wife, he'd cheat on you too... eventually.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> i likve in california and he lives in canada.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> thanks to anyone who responds to this..
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> She has gone beyond B**ch into the C word!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Hopelessly in love or in lust?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> then leave, be mysterious that way.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> Tell him what you just told us, then don't get too heavy on him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> and a mate needs to bring happiness to ur life---not drama!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Thats why when ever someone ask about my income etc...
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> now he doesnt return my calls, my emails, nothing .
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> when you were gay did you enjoy your relationship?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> try yahoo 360.  you can join some groups.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Maybe ask her to start over and go one another date.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> she is the love of my life.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> you smile get it over with !!!!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> this girl comes to my gym.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> that girl that told your ex that, is a psycho.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> don't ask to any body just see her eyes deeply u will know it
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Just say it, dont bs or anything just spit it out.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> umm you can find that anywhere.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> KNOWING WHAT U WANT WILL HELP U TO BE IN THE BEST FRAME OF MIND.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> THE FASTER YOU START A NEW LOVING RELATIONSHIP THE HAPPIER YOU WILL BE.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> just tell her  it wut id do
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> they like 2 B treated just like a baby
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_95> And oh us women love that.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> hmmm... who do you think is the beast?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> That is the same problem i have.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> i think that it shows that they have a sweet side.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> haha... gosh, sounds like something most girls do if they have a grudge on someone.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> now he wants me back and i do feel that i love him.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> all his friends told me he liked me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> your boyfriend may be stupid but not all guys are stupid.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> when i got him back i realized he was an idiot with a picture of my boobs.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> and that what it sounds like.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> So we are good friends now.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> There is an old saying that goes,   Fool me once, shame on you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> try to flirt wih her and move along....
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> Hey I feel you that happen to me like 1 month ago.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> don't call her house any more.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> WE GRADUATED AND I MOVED TO TEXAS FOR THE SUMMER.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> i am a brunnett , and i know i have alot of fun .
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> hahahaha n im wit her on dat!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> I have one in my freezer but unfortunalty it does not have a phone # or web site listed.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> What does love have to do with it!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> 'S and his answer and his ?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Honestly, I kind of do...Well I don't but they inspire me to do it or not to do it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> Just get her to chill out.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> YOU and YOUR BF SHOULD NOT ACT on it.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> if a guy likes u ,he will try to spend most of the time with u
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_35> I always wanted the bad boys.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> i'm clean , white , straight , in shape , and it's all for nothing right now .
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> and if she doesnt, you have to let her go.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> I did it twice in my life and I don't regret it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> no, i just look at her eyes and give her a smooth hug, then she got what i mean
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> isn't that cute he leave his socks all over the floor .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> if you already told him no and he keeps on asking, that's probably all that he cares about.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> but it is nice to spread it around.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Then maybe ask them how thier day is going.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Go ahead and walk her down the aisle.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> If u dont think your all that than they wont.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> no not really not all the time will some one marry a virgin
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> at first i would freaken freak out but i guess i would say do whatever makes you happy...
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> That if u really fell like that your soulmate.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> Slap you silly.. and then ask you if thats what you really wanted to tell mum and dad!
<NbChars_285> <LevSim_25> did he said that he likes you??
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> he loves me very much and my kids.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> I KNOW God has a sense of humor ...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> You don't need to be someones second ever!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> you really should have a boyfriend .
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> he's a peter puffer for life.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> i am agree with cracacola 85
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> If he avoids answering or brushes you off, then tell him you have a problem with this.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_30> tell me then.............but I don't need a physic thanks!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> You are not that far from your amore!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> depends on the induvidual, but... yes.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> People really do stupid things for love!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i guess that some people are just not open minded.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> if ur not a shy one and able to start a conversation.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> And I talk to her mom too.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> And their always on your mind.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> if ya, wait until the next dance and go ahead an ask him.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> Honey, if he cheats w/ you, he'll cheat on you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Wait another year so you guys wouldn;t get in trouble.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Men lie about things that dont really matter?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> just make sure to cup the balls.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> and maybe blame what you said to him before on being drunk.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> since boys have too much testosterone(sex hormone), they prefer more physical contact...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Maybe he would ask for a dinner date or something
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Just try to keep it respectable with the babie mom unless she gets unruly.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> and that's when you need to put a stop on it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> depends on what kind of lady you want
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> But make sure it's love not lust.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> You have to be there (SOMEWHERE!)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> has he been doing anything different sexually?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> she might not know if shes actually in love but she will know in the end of the relationship.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> If I don't call she will not call me
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Does she like hanging around you?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> and when this happens kick his butt to the curb b/c once a cheater always a cheater.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Finding a girl to talk to on Yahoo is like pulling teeth man.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> when you pass him in the hall say hi!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> How bout just saying ....Goodbye...Good Luck...turn around and walk away.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> Fool me twice, shame on me ?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> sometimes you don't think of them at all but that doesn't make you forget.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> i think its fine if u love them then the race doesnt matter
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> u know what u can get over him and find somethin NEW!!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_10> Oh, and GOOD LUCK FINDING ONE!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> What you mean like on Gladiators with the giant Q-tips?!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> if u have that then just wait till the time is right.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> (and you need to quit boffing your friends' ol' ladies!)
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> 90% he like u..and want 2 tell u ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Otherwise, I don't see what's wrong with 4 1/2 feet.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> how did you feel when you both broke up?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> Am I going to be rich??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> And don't have sex till you marry a guy!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> all he can say is yes or no!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Why don't you ask a hippo?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> Good Luck & don't give up!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> Don't feel bad, I'm 15 yrs.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> share with him what he loves, sports, food, intersts, ...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> hurting some1 emotionally is the worst thing you can do!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> then we had a falling out and it really hurts because i can't have him anymore.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> there is only one way to deal with temptation, don't put yourself in situations where there is temptation...........
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> (Yes I know many kids like this) Anyone else see my point?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> And what are you teaching your kids?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Ok i like this girl since the ninth grade.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> there is an old saying it is better to be safe than sorry?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> If NOT why, If Yes why?
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_25> 13 years and 2 kids later he still does.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> Some guys date like shopping for a car.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Only if you leave the Twinkies alone.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> when you get the chance and when youre ready, ask her out.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Yeah that is 3 guys but yeah just be yourself!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> thigh highs for more reasons than could possibly be named here
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> czz boys are boys there like that
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> if ur having trouble coming up with things to say just be like  how it goin.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> but dont feel sorry, i have another one on my way.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_40> walk away - your yourself, for his kids, for your kid.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> what do boyz do when they fool around?
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_40> yes if sex is all you want no if you want more than sex
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> don't say anything just keep reading in do time u will find something.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> you will be ok. so smile.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> if not you then have your answer.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> I never thought size mattered until I dated someone without size at all.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> then u can see him again and talk to him very easily.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> i think big noses are sexy ;)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Not nessesarly the way they look but simpler outlooks in life and furture...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> thigh high is sexy regular is blah
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> Hm.. ask her... seriously, that's the only way to know.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> You really will hav fun studying!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> love is trust..w/o it...alot of unhappy things will happwen...keep in contact...tell him that u trust him...in his face...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> if you did you wouldn't ask this question and you wouldn't care what anyone thinks!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Either:  1) He's insecure  2) You're cold  3) Both of you perceives the other this way.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> And yes, guys think they are very sexy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Then one girl said that one guy had a 9 inch and was bigger than the other.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> normal guys rarely apporach and take a chance from a girl unless they are instinctly safe.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> in other words shut up and dont talk about it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> If you too like her, then you should be happy that she calls you honey.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> Your self-respect/esteem is too great a price!!!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> we just weren't meant to be.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> i mean for sure for sure in love!
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_35> I'm pretty i just can't flirt.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> WE WOULD ARGUE OVER STUPID STUFF AND STUFF OF IMPORTANCE.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> dats jus nasty n slutty..o n did i mention nasty?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> i have no clue what you just asked.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> cuz ppl r ass holes and dont understand u !
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> i know about love because i love a girl but i dont know what is love?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Revenge probaby won't work, but ignoring him will.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> My guess is yes he does--how long you 2 been together??
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> guys have always had the burden of asking women out.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Well hiding something doesnt make it cheating.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> you'll never know, people could change u know
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> It's not that they can't they just choose not too.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> If you have to even ask then you must be small!!!!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> Give him a call to chat.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Converseley, I've come across an awful lot of my own kind that don't.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> talk to him to much and smile to him  all the time when u meet u good luck
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> If a guy really likes u he should ask u out.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> u don't need advice u need 2 break up!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> I'm not looking for a love interest just basically a woman to hang out with and maybe other things!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Depends on what guy he is.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Because people always reach that point where they think they are going to get married and then have sex.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> She might just be mad because you got him and she doesn't want to share her kids.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> SHES PRETTY AND POPULAR AND IM NOT SO POPULAR
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> No you certainly can do the walking at her request
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> ButI dont know how to find a good guy!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> I want to marry a blond with blue eyes and have little blond haird blue eyed babies.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> My daughter is 16 and her finacee is 18.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> Don't put your self in turmoil and remeber the end is only the begining.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> You don't have to do anything!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Yeah it means he loves you but not in a pervert way in a cute way.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> cuz u dont if  u found it and u cant define it
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> We will have to watch the show Cheaters for that episode... it's gonna be hot!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> to ur pchycologist - How can u trust someone when they think you're mad
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_20> didnt you already ask this because i remember answering
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> I am divorced once (picked the wrong guy, that's a shock, huh?!)
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> I have been myself lately and like 3 guys like me!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> will they b able to suppor you and kids and help pay bills?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> SHE VISITED DURING THAT TIME AND THEN WE WENT TO COLLEGE.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> dont cheat or be the other woman it will turn around and kick you in your ass.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> even when you are 16 you are not looking at them as if they are the marring type.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> that way you can convince them you are the guy for their little girl.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> face it, kids cost money - LOTS of money.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Read the Book Smart Love by Dr. Phil get it at a Library for free =)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> * He comes out and says it.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> I don't know what to do?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> just be yourself dont try and be someone your not and hopefully everything goes good 4 u
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> if you expect to do good in college.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_50> Nope, I practice abstintence(or however u spell it)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> I hope my information did some good for you!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> dishonesty which leads to infidelity and so on and so forth.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> if u have a question or need advice ask me and ill tell u ur future!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> I belive I get more from relationships with people who are like me.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> im a guy  i wouldn't kno
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> it'll get better as time goes by.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> be nice and polite and ask him out.
<NbChars_40> <LevSim_40> Go and have yourself some fun.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Tell her you don't want to marry this guy and to stop calling him up.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> my girlfriend met her husband at a biker party
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> I want a girl who loves me the same way I love her.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> well i guess all you have to do is be yourself!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> and if your like me the pro will be that you dont care what other people think.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> I wouldn't date either the ugly guy, or the hott guy...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> I have to answer this one!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Oh And Also Its Good To Not Have A Criminal Record Lol.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Because thats what kids do to you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> IN THE 12TH GRADE, SHE PROPOSED TO ME AND I ACCEPTED.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_10> SINCERITY WILL WIN U THE HAND OF ANY WOMAN AS LONG AS U HAVE PATIENCE AND ALWAYS B URSELF.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> isn't it the other way around?..
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> The guy always seems he wants to ask me something but he never does.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> I do its something most guys cant do with out .
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> especially those sold at hot topics.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Well, you know women say that all the good men are either taken or gay....
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> well either way is a sign that he might be interested.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Tell her thats shes pretty without being a perv about it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> so u don't get that scared.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> And by the way...thanks for liking the thick chix.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> and make it meals you knwo that he likes.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_40> jus' ask her where she is an' there go unless u r some creepy stalker guy!
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_25> yes,if some men are pigs then there are some bit**** out there too.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> If you got it flaunt it, but have the personality and attitude to back it up girl!
<NbChars_40> <LevSim_30> If not, then remember- There is always other fish in the sea,,,don't give up-one will bite...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> Try just making small talk first and smile a lot!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> it's how you use your penis......the size is just a bonus..  :)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> give love taps later on when you are comfortable okay.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> I fhe is good looking, what's the difference if he has hearing aids?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> i am 14.. it happened to me, i could happen to you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> You need to leave her alone, trust me, your 14!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> not know how and when i am going to die
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> you really just know when you know.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> You do what you wanna do.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> yes u will don't worry ur too young right now anyways
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> You cant do that with children for gods sake!
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_30> Since you already know he is a cheater (you told u) why catch him?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> but w/ my advice if shes sane you wont need it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> your thinking of confused not ,mysterios, its from trying to figure out woman
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> Good luck... it's a tough row to hoe.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> And, if so, why'd you marry him?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> Id say wait, but if you love him then go for it.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_30> bitch u sick as hell, that is not da way of the Lord.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> losing you virginity is to me seems like a big let down.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> I THINK IF YOU TELL THEM YOU KNOW COULD SCREW UP THE FRIENDSHIP IF YOU DON'T IT COULD ALSO.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> ask yourself am i still the woman my husband married.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Maybe they were brought up not to talk with their mouths full
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> you use that opening on your head that makes words come out.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Doesn't knock my friends, parents, siblings.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> I wouldnt worry about it much myself.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> Once a cheater ALWAYS A CHEATER!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> as all siblings do i am sure teasing would have to go on.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Why does he want you back?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> Start with Smart Love By Dr phil
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> you are pathetic show some pride
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> trying to breakup a marriage is not a good thing.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> ask to your father and mother, they will show you an example
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> i never did that ever and never will, thats wrong, some guys will and some guys wont.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> its a matter of making the move to get things fix.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> i hear similar things from him.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> I guess you wear hearing aids, I bet you are beautiful and think that that matters.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> Im probly way 2 young 4 u, but i hope u find someone.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> anyone have any idea what sites i can go to to get something extra special.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> Because I am not Mr. GQ.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> if you dont see his reflection you better run.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> If he truly liked you, height would not matter!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> We are friends but i really want to go out with her!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> If she doesn't, then you need to MOVE ON...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> first off go to college so you can make your own money!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> Maybe u just have a problem.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> If I were you I would not worry about the place as much as the person I was with.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> bz if u rly luved him den u sud b happy to b wid him no matter wat happenes.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> my family... they're the love of my life... so, my love story revolves around them...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> it also depends if he is really cute.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I have one right now and it's taking me forever to get rid of it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> HERE'S A THOUGHT LET'S BOTH TELL THEM AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> - nothing against the guy, though!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> not pretend to be someone else whom you're not!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> he wants to see, or likes.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_50> First, why aren't you having sex?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE A CLOSE FRIEND WITH YOU FOR BACK BONE.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> .i suppose, r these 2ppl u have never had relations with?
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> NO IT'S Stupid to do that.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> If he gets defensive then maybe you need to worry.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> GRAB THE HIGH HEELS, PUT THE FACE ON AND TAKE THAT SEXXY DRESS FORM THE CLOSET AND GO ..
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> (atleast for this full lipped gal)

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> and you should go out and have fun .
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> but remember if she comes the winner is not u. both of you.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> if you like a guy...  date him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Maybe you haven't had any in awhile.Maybe you have wet dreams or maybe you're just a freak.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Yes, I really am the best looking guy in the world!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> and not need to rely on the guy....  second they say love conquers all ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> it is one of the best things to do!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> do u really want to go for a girl who only wants a sexual relationship with u?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> get over him and find someone new........
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> i am so hurt and confused by this.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> yes but they not speak very well english
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> take you fishing far off shore
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> last time he didnt say any of that.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> you are the one that seemed hesitant about being with him then.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> it should be both of yours.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> do not try to mention ur talents or abilities, sacrifice etc.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> her name is jeanne owens thank you
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> If you're not that type of person don't try it, it won't do you any good.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> does he only come out at night or something?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> would u like to know that ur wife is in love with someone else?i'm sure u wouldn't appreciate.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> paranoia thinking you are the only sain one in the world  (but i really am)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> Just remeber guys get intimidated real easy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> it can be (some times ) actualy some very little times!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> You guys must be really close for her to ask this of you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> maybe your boyfriend is one of them, but it doesn't really sound like it.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> YOU SHOULD DEF GET RID OF THAT A S S HOLE!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> secret or no secret.u hav to let it out.it's never too soon to be in luv!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Say Yo wut d'U think about alligators as the ultimate survivors of the dinosaur ages dude?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> MAybe if you offered to let me date Johnny Depp then I'd be HAPPY!!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Love is not hard to find you just are looking to hard.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> I don't know if this guy likes me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> This sounds like my youngest uncle.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> Yea im 16 and im catholic
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> we will lead it they way we want to .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> find out why ur mom doesn't like her  and fix it  make her like ur girl
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> he just  needs to get his head on straight.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> start by going to places that you enjoy.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_20> find yourself a good girl not a piece of s**t.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> since u say he's so nice, wat is there 4 u 2 worry about??
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> other than bangkok,never go there in september.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> iasked my wife to marrie me only after 3 days .
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> If she doesn't care whatever you say, then leave her alone.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> U have not done anything wrong.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> She is already married to Jesse James (Monster Garage)
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_35> Never, ever mess with a married man.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> depends on what type of guys you like.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> it only becomes a sin when you make fun of it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> makes you sound a bit trashy.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> usually I'm very advertrous but no not 4 1/2 ft especially when I'm 6 ft
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> If she can't forgive him, then it's over.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> Anyone who won't even say hi isn't worth your time, anyway.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> the one beside the little finger.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> or maybe putt putt something fun and inexpensive
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> that is just not what we do.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> once you have that question answered, then you probably already knew what to do first.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> does he not want to marry me afterall?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> if youre friends you probably wont have much trouble asking her out.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> why do they act like pigs to you?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> feb 15, payday and able to buy stuff for my valentine!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> twice..anyone can make a mistake once
<NbChars_315> <LevSim_30> if hes with a new gf u dont need him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> BUT IM THINKING OF GIVING HER ANOTHER CHANCE.SHOULD I AFTER ALL THE PAIN FROM HER?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> after reading details, i would be suspecious.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> But Then again Its Guys Lol.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> 18, if its a serious relationship
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> flirt with him..watch his response and u can make out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> He is a jerk to ask you anything like that!!!!!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> WELL IF YOU LIKE HER ALOT AND YOU ARE DYING FOR HER YOU SHOULD ASK HER OUT.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> All guys are not pigs, just the ones that go oink.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Get a life and make some friends.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> why do you still talk to her ?
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_45> i like doing that stuff(having sex)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Well....maybe if you count when my mom was still calling me her baby when I was 16.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> if all he cares about is sex and not you then he isn't worth being with at all.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> make my voice louder so that he wont't use his hearing aids anymore...duh?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> up to you how you think about others....
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> Thanks, I needed that...... really, I did.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> I think it's dangerous that this guy even wants to be friends with you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> The bigger the man...  the bigger the baby.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> Just tell him how much you love him, but don't smother the guy.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> which would u choose and why?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> tale the time to actually talk about it.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> i would say-yes-if you both agree, what's the prolem?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> i'm only 18. i love him and i think i'm ready but i just need a little advice.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> no she is sleeping with your neighbor
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> during the 13 years ive been active only 4=)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Don't ever try to decieve your mate.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> definately call him or email him make it sound casual ya know.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO CHANGE YOURSELF TO MAKE HIM FALL BACK IN LOVE WITH YOU.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> It helps alot to have a medeator... Good Luck, thats a tough one.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> then just kinda slip some words in a casual converstaion ok
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> when it hurts to look back & ur to scared to look,ahead,look beside u & i'll be there.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> pick her up she'll think its cute and prolly kiss you!!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> you have the right to walk away.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> You really dont have anything to lose
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> will try to be your self try it you will like it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> Ok my ex girlfriend broke up with me and she said she wants to get back with me.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> 13-24, then at about 25, u should get  married to someone.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> It showed me that he really cared about ME.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> u dont get over it.... u move on.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> i got a question: when was the last time that he said i love you?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> he just dont know how to use it.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> O man that su(ks so majorily.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> every lead that i have persued has become a dead end .
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> let's be honest he probably won't.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> not in florida but still need friends
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> many men who do this know that they dont they just dont tell the female.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> watch the woman the who have all the guys attention and watch how she moves
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> sometimes they don't know what to say.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> well i love to be touched everywhere.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> NOW FAST FORWARDING TO THIS CHRISTMAS BREAK.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Usually big feet mean big dick.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> It may be different for you tho...
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> Do you see what I mean ?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> Sure, it's ok, if she's interested.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> suggest me some ways to ask her out?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> does a kiss on the cheek count  as a first kiss?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> i going to a dance over the week end and i want to ask him to go with me.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> U deserve better...find you a guy that really likes YOU!!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> I don't really think about it at all.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> And i believe what it says.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> beat the liven shit out of them
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> well, dat depends...if yall hav a really gud relationship worth jepordizin or not!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> The next night I babysit the Doe's.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> if so it could get kinda strange
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> The age-old question:  do something fun, or something for the long-term?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> is it anything i can do to know better a girl?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> So you're afraid to ask him out.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> hahaha i think it supposed to be Psychic?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> You said my guy is not interested in making alot of money.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> also which one loves you back?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> go to college and get a great career then .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> email me at clairebaire5590@yahoo.com plus im a cheerleader
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> A teddy bear that say I love U
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> unless i'm attracted to him why should i care?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> he probably doesn't call you much because you two are together.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> So good luck with that, and hopefully she'll understand :o)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> i would guess either too slutty or too much work
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> ur not so limited when picking a friend or a lover.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> Unless you have kids but you didn't give tht info
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> At 17 you're still vulnerable, & still got a lot to learn.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_25> ignore it or break up with this person
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> If the guy is clingy and insecure then almost no matter what you do you're hosed.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> You are way too young to be worrying about this guy or any other.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> i,ve always heard that but i dont beleive thats the case all the time
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_25> look clean too, you can be scruffy, but be clean scruffy
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> #2 I still sorta love him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> how could you jepordize your relationship with your best friend?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> I can't get her hurt look off my mind, I keep seeing it over and over in my mind.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> i think 6 years already too long, what's so special him?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> you cant go on like this.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> Like I said, just tell her you say stupid things when you're nervous or something.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> Ya so he always talks about this girl that he likes but will never talk to her!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> i went to prom bymyself....trust me some things are better with another person.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> you don't have to break it off.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> It is totally diferent with this girl.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Picking her up seems like the best choice.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> it probably seems that way because that's what people see on the internet and on tv and in movies.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> How do you ask a girl tHAT YOU'VE KNOWN FOR MANY YEARS OUT?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> you defineatly need to wait till you know the time is right
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> do u like your friend better or your ex better?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> I DOnT LIKE BEiNG CALLEd THAT EVERYDAY ESCPICALLY AROUND OTHERS.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> u may know that she's loving you by gestures.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> But first I have to ask how much you know about this lady?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i mean if hes your bf then where ever he chooses should be good enough.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> haha you sure have a wild imagination, huh?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> all normal guys want is a quickie.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> Remember, guys use love to get sex, girls use sex to get love.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Good luck, I just dealt with this problem myself.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> i like love this person but i didn't tell my parents yet so i don't know what to do.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> i dunno, thats a good question
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> In life things doesn't always go our way.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Send me a signal dude, this is YOUR happ;iness.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> really i dont like BIG lips but that have to juicey and look kissable...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> i am just curious cuz i think i have found mine.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> but choose wisely & youll find a nice 1.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> it is just that she has breast.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> i really think it depends on the person!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Girls can look even more stupid most of the time.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> ive waited all my life, and i am truely happy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Im not usually like this with other girls though.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> let him find out about the stripper part on his own.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> JUST BE YOURSELF BUT MAKE HIM SEE WHAT HE IS MISSING.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> I AM THE YOUNGEST CHILD IN OUR FAMILY.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> i have been in love with another man for the last 9 years.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> i couldnt handle seeing him w/ another.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_25> I'm like 5'2, and the guy I like is like 6'3, maybe taller.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Do u really want to kiss someone who doesn't want to kiss u.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_45> Could be you just want out.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> There many who believe in the stuff.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> and how do you overcome that all your friends have their couple and you dont!!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> So be young and have fun!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_25> don't hang with them too much.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> haha..tell em...just be like look u need to fallback a little bit ur stressin me it works
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> are  you a perfectionist?if your answer is yes,i guess its sth related with it
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> What could he possibly be searching for with another that you two do not share anymore?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> I like this girl but im 2 shy to ask her out.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> as far as her being a stripper..its hard to say.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_75> great sex is a good idea
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> You can either play it off like you don't care - It's just talking, what's the big deal?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> dnt u think that she would like u betta if u picked her up
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Yes because after your married you should be confident you won't get herpes.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> its wrong for u to make him leave his wife.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Then the A****** got her pregnant.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> yes a lot do but in my family not ever
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> What's so wrong with men working and women staying home with the kids?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> And no, you're not rushing anything.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> show him your not afraid of making the first move.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_40> search for new friends but always never think about marrage
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> find it when you least expect it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> What is a good size on a guy?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> find a guy thatll like you for who you are-- never get desperate.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> hard core is a lot more graphic, showes penitration, and has all the moaning w/ back ground music.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> hang out with friends, chat online, or call someone when you feel lonely.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> I WOULD LOVE TO TELL HER BUT THE FRIENDSHIP WE SHARE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> i met mine while driving through town.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> Because you probably have to pee!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> so if anyone knows anything please let me know.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> Well , you're gonna do what you want in the end anyway.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> and i have a 4.5 or something gpa.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> all the mail that is from nobody, advertisement that bother.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> It's why we're all here now!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> WE'LL TELL; YOU ONE THING ONE MINUTE AND SOMETHING ELSE THE NEXT..
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> be yourself buy her flowers something rele nice...
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> if it's 1 kid $5 2 or more $6 each
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Some like assertive, some like shy (don't be too shy though, cuz women will think you're a wimp).
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> I had a boyfriend for 8 yrs and we split after we had a baby.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> I just played a song to him, then I told him thats how I felt about him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> It depends on what type of person you are!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> he just be reaching out to compensate for something
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> try 2 stop thinking of him and try 2 find another guy thats even better.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> its not about how big it is its how you work it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> see i am a new student there, so she hadly know me
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> how can i do it at the gym?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> Or do just wanna have 2 ladies in bed with you getting feaky every night?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> I think I know this guy...is it a brown bag with a picture of Brad Pitt on it?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> Cuz we were soooo born that way.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> The (ugly dudes) get the pretty women because of what they have devolped.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> that way her way her parents gets to see how you look first.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> no, sample the goods before you marry them
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> if you do not do it someone else will.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> You could also be just so awesome a friend that they really DON'T want to ruin it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Love that comes with money ;-)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Because ugly Guys are so nice and girls like nice i guess!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> I wouldn't give my number...I would get his.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> She looked at me and I saw the hurt look on her face.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> stripper is not the worst she could be.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_25> yeah ya know people met other people,and you grow apart
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> my husband found me on q 106 rock n roll date line which is a radio station.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> How about getting him a really cool pair of shades?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> okay, maybe i am just shooting off, but really.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> then it is meant to be .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> i am 25 years old and here is my opinion...i don't think it would matter at all!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Ever heard the saying : First time, shame on them.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> i need pic first and info who are you?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> cuz if so, uh...why would she?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> uh thigh highs...no one wears pantyhose anymore...it's so damn 80's
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> love is hard because your nervous and shy
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> PICK YOUR BATTLES WITH US, BUT ALWAYS MAKE US PAY FOR OUR SCREW UP'S
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> or sometimes we just want to be perfect or we're just stupid sometimes.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> If not then you shouldn't have any problems!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Some people don't mean to do that, it's just how they naturally talk.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> I'm right there with your, bro.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> wait until you both calm down and talk to them nicely and work it out
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> luckly you do not have to pick a partner (husband or wife) at that young age.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> calling them the ladies won't help... *shrugs*
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> you dont have too be his girlfriend.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> send it through a good friend of her.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> but if you go to some pro, use it compulsorily.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> there is no way to tackle one iam one i should know!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> if i was your brother and i just told you i want to be a girl.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> For now just have fun and focus on the important things, school, family, and good honest friends :)
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> wow i can't beleive you just asked that!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> my friend mack the wise says it depends if she is a prostitute
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> you should probaly pick her up.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> THE PAST IS THE PAST,IF ITS SOMETHING GOD AWFUL KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> if he dosent like u becaus your short hes not the boy for u!
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_35> swing as in bring another partner into th bed?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> That would be in my experiance, anyways.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> u probably wont if it was a short relationship
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> If u really wanna know hang around some of his friends and ask kinda without asking.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> IM 33 YEARS OLD AND THE BIGGEST CHANGES IN MY LFE HAPPENED BETWEEN THE AGE OF 19 AND 25.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> u becareful dont ever let a guy do that 2 u.  u 2 good for that
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> cause he needs to understand that ur going out wit someone
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> definetly, just try with open hearted & be honest about your love.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> that's what my friends say^_*)(you know how guys are!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> i've been wit my bf for 4 months and we are really serious.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> should i tell him i like him?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> you have the right to go out ith who ever you want.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> i really dont see the big deal about interracial dating!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> junk mail is just as it says, junk mail.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> if its b/c your lonly than you need to find more friends and not a boyfriend
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> ur a little young, so don't worry about that kind of stuff.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_20> Seriously, I doubt she is the bride of Satan, he would probably kick your ass.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> If she's not interested, move on!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> At least thats what id do.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> The type of person you're trying to attract (a decent girl) is most likely to be hanging out where?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> If he had true feelings for u, don't u think he'd do anything for u?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> u say he's perfect 4 u. well, if thats true, u have 2 c wat happens.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Hope that was of some help  Jay
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> If he says yes then hoo rah.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> They both knew it would hurt you!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> it is all about your start till you met him and be as one.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> concetrate on what you have going for you right now and what interests you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> did you try to talk to him?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> There is a chance he will go back out with you because most guys don't forget girls they love.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> but if means with a boy well then yah its a tough time but ...oh well....MOVE ON!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Nickname: vanessitacool Reason: My name is Vanessa, im not tall, and im cool!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> But if no well.. Hey you tried and all that counts.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> why would you wanna hurt the mother or father of your children?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> Ever heard the saying Fool me once, shame on you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> i think it changes over time but not end... you probably can drift apart
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> join reunion.com they will search ur friend
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> i know that it hurt and it way take time to get over him.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> being happy but the 2000 style word i think means liking a man when u r a men
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> and ask her if she really does love you.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> whayever u do dont say its not you its me thats horible.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> Nice guys don't refer to their girlfriends as ho.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> because of the testosterone, it retards them
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> and then, you have to consider the other person.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> All girls are faithful til they get caught.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Rejocie that your not whaded down and go to a party and Flirt Flirt FLIRT.

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> you could just be friends with benefits.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> just tell him how you feel.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> these things make it easier to approch her if u know who she is.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> trust me, when you find the right guy, itll be well worth the wait.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> go sleep with his best friend
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> before the clothes even come off, what kind of things get you guys excited?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> When your always thinking about that person.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> Sorry I wasnt up to par.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> my problem is that i don't have a license and cannot drive over to see him.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> you might be shy, or just nervous.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> that would be a reAL TURN OFF.I WANT HER IN HER REAL BODY.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Do you realize there are husbands out there who really don't want their wives in bed with them?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> like every thing seen act the way he doesnt like then he will get very mad and dump u
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> i hope you;re not having sex  don't worry.

<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> make it easy for the both of you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> but 3 years is too much
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> That depends if ur a guy or a girl

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> do not listen to what your friends say.

<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> but it si their problem not yours my friend.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> I asked- where can I get married outside the USA easily & fast
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> but when we arent broke up yet we always talked in phone or text up to 9pm only!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> better leave the things as they are.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Don't ask yes or no questions.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> people will only do stuff to you or around you if you allow it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> if your best friend hates you, then why are you best friends?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> If you can't afford a nice dinner than you can't afford to have a girlfriend....what are you thinking of?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> But do give it at least a year, especially if there are kids involved.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> that would be ur chance 2 introduce urself!!!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> Does this guy even know you???
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> Do guys think they are sexy?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Not 100% sure ..but ... it has be be Anna Nicole Smith and that old rich dude.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> you wrote; IN LOVE like my first response....HELL NO!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> The guy is a real a**hole too hang out around!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> you know yourself better than anyone, youknow what is good and bad about you, so believein yourself
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> what if ul lose the girl that u love?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> be urself..if she doesnt like u 4 who u r..then she suffered and is not a good person
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> a guy that worries about his size might have a problem.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> please don't give room for the devil.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> sure but your paying for the first date
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> and why this question arise in your head now?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> yes my only best friend in the world is a girl and i am a boy
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> first of all...not all guys are just after  sex.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> Funny thing is, they're probably like that themselves, too.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> the answer is because you took her place so she thinks.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> no not all guys only the ones that have self-esteem issues.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Are there any women out there that likes big brothers?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> so then u won't b so scared .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> i've always wondered about this myself.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> carefully,  but it happens, start with the buddy/ frined thing before you go to sex.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> but right now, focus on being you and and what makes you happy.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> why not tell you lover you feeling?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Pick the one you like more...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> or u culd prolong both of their pain n torture dem both n many, many ways!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> but he is waiting for the best time .May be when u r alone.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> well, you don't really have to take note of where they're from or what they believe in.
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_30> no teeth, more mouth than hand and with the other hand you tighten the balls ;-)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> a boy and a girl who doesnt have any relations shouldnt be alone together.its a sin...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> nope it is supposed to be like that.i see boys having girlfriends 6 years younger to me.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> i will :] lol haha jm wow wow.. sad question..
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_40> do somthing that u can't c him.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> now he acts like hes piss off at me for giving him attiude am i right or wrong?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> then u will b so happy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> and no don't sleep with them they might have someting.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Give it time, give him space and time to think and sort things out..
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> ...you know, the one with plants inside- honest question but i am not stupid.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> it doesn't seem to matter anymore.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> do you really know what love is .
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> it really jus depends on who u think iz better bein jus a friend or sumtin more!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> Kick him in the 'nads, then dump him.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> Plus he can hide all kinds of stuff in there
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_40> cheek kiss is ok, hug is better.... 1st kiss on 1st date?that is lust....relationship won't last long.....
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> most girls think that it is the guys job to make the first move.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> You just got to know when you find the one.... You just have to trust your heart.....
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> OR, HAVE ONE OF UR FRIENDS DO IT.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> hire sex buddies to come to your house and get strippers if u like that
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> start cheating on them and tell them you dont like your own medicine huh?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> I saw a girl I guess with lukemia or something,she was gorgeous!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> my best friends dad died and the mom was closer to suicide after four months rather than dating guys
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> if you love each other completely yes.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> i dont think that you can compare the love.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> well im 20 and never gone for a date.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> if you're not and don't go to NFA and live in CT don't even answer.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> If you like god, a church.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> Why don't YOU think she likes you the way you do?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> Maybe he just needs a little help!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> women use it to get what they want when they want it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> and I say that t boys all the time that i like.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> as long as he or she is legal enjoy!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> we headed back to the party and I felt really good about her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> i doubt it will work but, its worth a shot
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> here but cant do it in the army!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> depends on both the girl & the guy.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> girl go out w/ a man who is totaly bald.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> you need to get over her.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> i know if i'm not gettin laid - somethin's wrong and it's not gonna last long like that!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> first of all, u have to be hot.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_55> that means that she loves u
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> I couldn't tell you dude... women are strange creatures.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_25> Why dont you ask him if he dont answers maybe he's gay
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> December 8th, I called him to tell him happy 30th b'day.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> it shouldn't piss them off i am a girl and it doesn't piss me off.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> And also, what about hairy chests?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I dont want to break up and make a mistake.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> passion and the love for extasy
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> i would just try to tell her that her being negative makes you unhappy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Stupid movie .. you know what's going to happen but you cry anyway!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> I DONT LOOK AND WHEN I DO, I FIND THE WRONG PERSON COMPLETELY.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_15> WILL YOU GO OUT WITH ME?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> no it is just his LINE to try and get you on your back
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> i really was hurt by that... she doesnt deserve u!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> You guys are already friends and it sounds like he was interested in you too.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Please tell how old u r and when and where it happened.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> eat carb foods and starches- pasta, rice, potatoes,pancakes etc.. and friend foods-chocolate always helps to and don't excersize
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> now, let's get down to business.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> Any advice you want to listen to?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> bring  her  flowers,  kiss  her, dont  touch  her butt unless she  likes it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> If he say's he is gonna work late.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Give it a little while I am pretty sure u 2 will be back together.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> if u want 2 make love, maybe a gigolo....
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> I wouldnt be mad, I'd just pick better friends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> if uve made out with him yet then yes, if not, then no
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> You either love him or you don't.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> go find a guy in person!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> guess those aren't great places to look for a man.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> not until at least 3rd date.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> Find him and bang him like no other.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> at least it seems so judging by all the people asking about that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> dont waste your time on him!!!
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_30> My mail address... guys_millenium@yahoo.com.... CHAT id... guys_millenium           ......
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> what u consider fun might not be what another person thinks is fun
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> if you feel right for each other... if you feel happy no matter what..
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> He takes the safe fun, u the sure shit.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> Sounds like you got alot of hang ups though.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> i want to kiss him but there is some people that talk shit.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> Ok, first of all not all women are like your ex.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> I can't have a girl who doesn't shave her legs, FYI.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_20> no, but maybe this will help.Good Luck
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> he was not going to live with me to help me.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> My friend is a little bit of a control freak.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> your avitar looks cute and kinda like mine.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> wait this one out, he seems to be either shy or ashamed...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> I enjoy being me no matter how lonely or depressed I get.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> reading your story hurt me too i m sorry for u
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> you should be looking for the girl that likes you...
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> it takes a bigger woman to walk away than to stay and fight.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> yes it does, but shouldnt be done like your having sex with just someone but that special someone; slowly!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> Start a funny or unusual topic...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> if you casually chat and have no emotional connections and dont participate in online sex, then no.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> then again i may not be looking very hard, though.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I don't really think it's the ring that matters!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> size matters but for what effect?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> if he still adores if you tell him you not interested ,maybe there might be something there?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> I met him though a friend and I totally trusted her that he was a great guy.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> i have no idea if you find out tell me
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> Get out and get an alimony NOW!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> Do not talk to her on the phone, online, in person, etc.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> Better is not the word I would use, they are just different.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> Im a skinny woman and fat men turn me on.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> whatever you did to him it probably isn't worth holding a grudge for 5 years.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> My boyfriend of 2 and 1/2 years has a best friend whose wife HATES ME!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_15> THIS COULD BE A SIGN TO LEAVE WHO EVER YOU ARE WITH.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> Good luck, there is a man out there for you!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> babe hes just using her for sex... and probly will try to do the same with you...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> a nice guy will just not play as hard as a bad one, same is true for girls.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> Why would you want to become a fool?
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> Kill her and him then yourself.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> No not at all ugly people need love to ya know
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> And we thought we were freaky, SCARRRRY!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> Then ask her to marry you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> THEY WANT A EASY GIRL THAT WILL LET THEM INTO BED.....AND THAT'S NOT YOU.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Girls around here are too prude for their (or my) own good.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> That guy is so crazy and probly has issues, its not you hon.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> that even answers all the weard questions
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> dude it takes time to know when u r ready to get married!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> his so called 'friend' that takes him to and from work smokes too.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> But what the hell, theres nothing really wrong with that.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> I M READY TO GO WITH HIM.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> Zodiac doesn't matter that much for stuff like this.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> If yes, why do u think u do it?
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> He does keep it trimmed for me You know where??
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> never - it only causes more problems and most people can't ever forget it
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_35> one word: gay  he most likly gay.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> tell her that u need some time alone and u don`t want to be with any1 right now
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> If you want to marry the man, do!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> tell her u meant it in a kinda wait-a-go way.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> throw a scrap of meat in a bar.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> ask her if she didn't get coal for christmas.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> Hmmm...intersting...someone who is annoyed by a guy saying hi.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Eat some candy - get that blood sugar going!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Ditch her; leave her in the dirt!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_10> HEY!WHO DA HELL IS UR WIFE BOYFREN IS!THEY SHUD STAY IN UR HOUSE
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_65> no it is not i hope u didnt do dat cuz u could mess up your relationship
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> Now..I need to tell you that the reality it this: NOTHING is gonna happen between you and me..ever.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_50> some women do some don't that is a personal choice
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Why does a dog lick its butt?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> YOU'LL HAVE THINGS TO REMEMBER WHEN U GET OLD
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Then gradually go back to punk.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> i hardly everrr see him in school either usually i see hima t my brothers basketball games .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Am I alone in this ?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> if ur happy with the person and willing to sacrifice anything for him/her....then ur inlove
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> when u feel sexy boys are looking for that
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> Well, has he ever said he didn't love you when he cheated??
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> But if you really want him to like you, you should hang out with him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> ALL THEY REALLY WANT IS A PIECE OF YOUR ASS.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> 1 suggestion,,,, get a pre nup
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> u just haven't found it yet.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> when u get ur emotions in the right place everything wil come together!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> I got my girlfriend coz she was the first one to make the move!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> flurt but not to much talk to the one you like and call him or her
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> i should be askin myself that!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> Now, this guy told her he couldn't go around wid her.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> and you will be wondering how did this happen .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> i do not understand what u r asking
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> cant help u there and u should lower your goals alittle.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> If you think she's lying to ya, then she probably is lying.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> i tell my mom or dad when ever i have a boyfriend to let them be aware!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> My dad is moving out on Jan. 15, but it's not soon enough!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Would he have a problem if you sucked your baby down a sink if you were pregnant?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> just watch his behavior and u will decide after
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> If thats happening then u better watch out.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> get his number and then wait to see if he will call back.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> I HAVE BOTH YOUNGER & OLDER FRIENDS
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> I really didn't want to marry him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> you will have the man that has your personalty
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> If she really hates you that much for no reason, then she's psycho and you should just avoid her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> If the guy is JUST a friend then I don't see a problem with it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Thats the way it is boys....thank ur hormones.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Do I just attract crazy people?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> there is nothing like judging that one thing.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> i hope u are not hater of thick girls.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Seriously..I always seem to find the hidden psycho in the guys I date.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> IF HE CARES FOR YOU, AND RESPECTS YOU HE WILL UNDERSTAND.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> Do I just attract crazy people?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> there is nothing like judging that one thing.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> i hope u are not hater of thick girls.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Seriously..I always seem to find the hidden psycho in the guys I date.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> IF HE CARES FOR YOU, AND RESPECTS YOU HE WILL UNDERSTAND.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> When you dont reason any more.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> I felt like I was dying....and in some ways I was I guess.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> I was reading and thinking, wow that sucks!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Everyone she has slept with you will then be with too...think on that one!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> u'll know  ( but u have to make the first move )
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> whoever feels more comfortable making the first move
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> but if you are ready then ya will know.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> I hope it works out for you,  I know its rough with little ones involved.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> My question is isn't that like having your cake and eating it to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Well you can just use yahoo answers.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> especially if she says she love him and has sex with him and gets freaky with him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> sounds like that she has full custody and you have visitation rights.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> I WOULD LOVE TO SEE MY MOM HAVE HER SPECIAL DAY.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> it's all about the chemistry in the couple
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> no b-cause i started dating at the age 12 and i didn`t do any thing stupid
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_60> 90% hes somone u never thought he wod be!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> my love for her will not pass how can i get her back
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> not really, i've been down that road a couple of times.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> When you find that special person.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> it shd be u directing urself.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> Guys are smarter, they get treated like crap and out she goes and good riddance to her!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> They had a child 3 yrs ago.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> sayyyy, an 18 year old with raging hormones.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> I love a fuzzy faced man!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> For men and women, but not any men or women.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> love takes no account of a wrong suffered ever!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> ok i was in a similiar situation!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Remeber keep it cool be yourself
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Maybe she wants and looks for something more in a person.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> IF YOU LIKE HER ENOUGH AND CAN SEE A FUTURE WIT HER
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> ive always ended up with shorties but always longed for a tall beauty
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> go ask your GYN  go buy a book it does work
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> You can't test a guy like that.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Cause I am with a girl named Yasmine
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> when you  find the right guy
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> carefully,  so you dont get hurt.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Marry the guy, he probably really loves you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> this guy was talking 2 his friend guy: i was so pised 2 day friend: why wut happened?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> * one more thing, he has to make me feel like his girl, like he's proud to have me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> I am a shy guy and no I am not lying.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> You cn always get a bigger ring later!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> I nice male would never do that!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> honey i dont know but when you find out tell me please
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> because u dont want to rush right into things!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> no , chances are he is just interested in one thing.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> If a guy likes you, don't worry, he will call.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> You can't help who you fall in love with and love has no color!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> i love my dog, and i am not attracted to her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> you never ment to be rude.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> I was 13 and it was with a boy I am still in love with today
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> this is a casual place for people who just want to relax and have fun.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Give him time and probably space to sort things with his ex.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> enjoy your life what a waste.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> because you're empty and lonely.. is it clear!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Maybe you'll get both, like my husband!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> Does that mean everyone does - NO.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> u don't need to depend on a guy.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> i always in love not only to opposite sex but also to people sorround me....
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> You just tell them you don't need that in your life!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> it varies on the people but generally men do, sorry guys
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> people always want wat they cant have duh
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> My husband was gone alot and I got used to doing my own thing.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> sometimes u will stay hard for to long.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> Few men like to go with a girl MUCH taller than them.... well, except Tom Cruise, maybe.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> Girls fake so much, you can never tell.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> he says he smokes because his job is stressful but he always tells me that he always has fun.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> hey why do gay guys use ribbed condoms.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> Go up to her and tell her that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> keep them in your heat, and move on!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> So if you find your shoe.........care for that soul.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> WHAT IS MAKING YOU LOVE THIS OTHER PERSON IS SHE/HE IS FALLING SOMETHING THAT THE OTHER IS NOT.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> (9 out of 10 times if someone has cheated, they will cheat again).
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_45> think about what you are about to do.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> Word like( Hoooo, yes baby, Come in on me....) are usally heard.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> Oh well, it is not what you asked about.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> And i don't know what to do.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> The m and m's make people's lives easier, but they r not what is the most important...!!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> if you start listening to love songs.. and soon you sing along to them.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> And a real friend wouldn't do that.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> if you cant get her out in your head,, thats it....
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> If this person is a man...simple...Don't do it!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> for guys they don't  but for women they go togather unless they are really sick emotionally.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> (i had no more room x.X lol)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Just say hi and take it slow.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> When it happens, you will know.... :)
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> and she is blaming the men for them even though she was the one that cheated .
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_30> -SOme kissing techniqus would be nice..list some if u got any -How do u inpress a girl (P.S.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> He is probably more scared of talking about it than you!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> 1st time he asks, say: Love is /so/ overrrated!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> aleast she is putting effort to look good!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> aww i'd thing that was the sweetest thing ever
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> this isnt the best way 2 get a grlfriend u no.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> dunno.. mayb coz they din go visit their doctor lately..
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> wants every guy to like her, she got felt up by every guy in 6th grade!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> and if so what are those places
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> well how about a friend, and i can tell you that i'm not old i'm barely 16 i'm anthony
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> sorry, i'm an american, but I'd still be your friend
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> I SAY IT'S THEIR DAY AND THEY CAN DO WHAT THEY WANT.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> The girl may walk to the guy and start ask them about gym tips :)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> so remember its a game guys and girls play.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> Or maybe you're not doing enough flirting back if you do like them?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> HE said after he had sex with her he told her he was sure that they were over.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> If he tries to get help and faulters.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> :)  I love questions like this.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> and i had a lot more to say about it, but im sick, so im gonna go die now.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> And i think she likes me because she always sit's by me in science.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> So dont get upset when women dont faun over you because you're a sensitive guy with no money.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> u will know when u find the love of ur life responsible and mature enough
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Why do u need someone sexy to talk to?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> are you scared and feel responsible cause hes there to take care of u?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> omgzors be like teh 1337 pwnzors and say Go OuT WiTh Me like a prep
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> i'm in the same situation, it totally sucks.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> since on peach was bad the rest arent allways bad!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> ladies will say either yes or no..
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> but if you don't and they find out then you are so busted!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> first start by throwing everything of their's away, then ask your friends to not talk about her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> no way it would just be like starting over at the begining again
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Don't believe me now, but you will soon find out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> if you think he is mature enough to hear the reason.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_90> I would not want a friend who fights a lot, why does she fight?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> you have to wait dont be stu.... if he wants your relationship he call you first
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> Or tell him that you like someone else.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Don't have kids just because someone else wants you too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Just because they're a kid doesn't mean that they don't always know when something isn't right.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> Right now she seems kinda lost.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_25> so, why do you wanna get married?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I love a guy with a great attitude!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Just for your safety ALWAY MEET in public.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> she will start abusing your boys physically .
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> consider him as what he is a looser and go next!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_20> Do yoga...free your mind...get a puppy....just be FABULOUS!!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> u can find anywhere 2 have a good girl..but u just have 2 be careful of some of them...:)
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> and what if it was your first time and his thrid?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> her mom found out and she laughed but i was never allowed to sleep over again
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> Because After a certain point, all they think about is Sex, sex, sex, sex!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> my man is the most masculant guy i know and he was the most understanding when i told him!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> may i know his chikka id for tha past years?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> like any sensible person it's my career, my family and my girlfriend.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Tell your b/f to get them.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> yes i do, i am in one right now, and we are engaged to be married.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> tell him that u got an accident yesterday ... and note his reaction
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Then again, maybe you are just 'seeing' things?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> YOU like em even while you love them
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I'm a blonde and I have a blast!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Ask her if she wants to go see a movie or whatever.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> People always want what is not so easy to get.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> It's called testosterone,u can't help him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> if she was single for like a week or less then go with ur gut!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if she moves closer to you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> I'm in Okinawa, Japan and I was just wondering how I find and win a japanese girls heart.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> does anyon ehave any ideas on what i should do?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Why not, you've got nothing to lose!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> U may not be meeted any girls that like ur mind..
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_65> Let her catch you cheating on her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> If he does not do that, then don't waste your time because he is just playing the field.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> But beware, i can be bad sumtimes too(if u no wat i mean) LOL Just messin wit ya.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> well, i guess it's just the same as the song that goes..love moves in mysterious ways  ;)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> yeah, i agree with the first two.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> honey u shold try on my number  00 92 300 6447783
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> Remember: Once a cheater always a cheater.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> and when you're married, you get lots of practice and don't have to worry about diseases!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> i really like this guy and im really crazy about him and i don't know if im in love
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> Is this a bad thing...should I feel offended???
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> If you can't apply these 3 words at least 1time per day you're NOT LIVING you're EXISTING!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> -HOw do women wanna be Kissed?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> same thing happened to me I DO MUCH BETTER AS A SINGLE MOTHER
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> I thought my hearing aid was broken!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> Total stranger, and I said yes.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> it cannot last forever long discance.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_70> If not, then you are cheating.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> enjoy the game but dont get caught up in it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> If anyone here says shy guy they are lying like the devil.
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_35> 1.mexican boy 2.american boy 3.spanish boy 4.iranian boy 5.chinese boy
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> I like my man's hair (armpits, chest, belly & legs).
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> why wold you wanna forget it?don't forget just move on.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Should I have sex at the age im at of 13
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> DO NOT LET HIM SEE THE THINGS THAT YOU SHOULD GIVE (THE LOVE, AFFECTION, CARE, ETC)TO SOMEONE ELSES ARMS.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> are you sure it isnt just lust, infatuation, physical attraction or just puppy love.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> why do they make fun of you?
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_55> If you need to talk, honorarius@yahoo.com
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> but she ran off and wont talk to me--what should i do????
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> generally speaking it's just gross IMO
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> So let your man keep his hair...EVERY.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> But It's very hard to be!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> between those 2 names personally i would pick kyle!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> 3rd time: I like you like a friend, but you're not what I'm looking for.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> Save your it for the I told you so stage or you could snap a few pics!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> That`s just dirty especially if he has kids, it`s degrating.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> just be your self and the rest will come
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> THEY BOTH HAVE BEEN MARRIED BEFORE AND HAD CHILDREN.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Just take it easy on her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> ...and why they did not work.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> BUT!, if he's like all the other guys on the planet he just likes punching the monkey...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> And men please don't even bother to defend yourselves because you know it's true!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> I say.. GET OUT WHILE U CAN... find another boy... you deserve much better!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> but actually you'll regret it later.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> i always wonder about people who feel they have to drink to have a good time.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> that has happened to me and I felt like kicking her ***.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> both of you are mature enough to discuss this like two people that are just friends.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> if she has started cheating on you .
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> men orgasm faster, so it's a point of mine to satisy my female first
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> Do they like you if not give up
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> same thing happened to me 12 yrs ago!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> i think a BAD girl is that person who is not HONEST to anyone!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> i like both of my friends who are close and trust me a lot.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> I mean i dont agree with it either i feel u on that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> No need to anymore *BIG SMILES*
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> goofy is one thing but not a fool.!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> but, you can look but, can't touch.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> then maybe you will learn how to kiss better.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> im glad you fixed your spelling, and yes.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> ooohh, be very careful with that one.. i know you're all excited about getting together with your chatmate.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> it wasnt you it was all him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> it is different for every guy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> and who knows amounst those who where always there.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> and u can get medication to treat those spots...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> because we don't have anybody to comfort us
<NbChars_260> <LevSim_15> By hate I mean SHE HATES ME!!!!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> once a cheater always.....most of the time that is right girl!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> This is a nice dance to go to with someone you really care about, believe me, we remember!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> plus he's 200 miles away whose to say that once he's with you he won't cheat with her?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> your hand will always love you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> He's got to be a lot of fun to be with!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> that would make my heart melt though, wit anger
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> also remind her that it takes 2 to  tango
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> no cuz looks dont matter it only matters if you let it!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> if you suspect it he probably is!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> A one-night stand is if the guy used u. Bu tis he busy?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> I like both of them equally and they do like me a lot.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> on the cheek yea but not on the lip.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> A: Because they think we care!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> and you shouldn't let others dictate your love life.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Don't let anyone fool you on that.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> just hook up with someone try it you can always test it out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> also, the more languages u know, the more opportunities u will have to success in the future!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> lol However, she cares about you enough to not hurt your ego!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> i'm getting tired of it makes it seem like you are trying to say he is ugly on purpose.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> in korean that would be called MEH'RYUK
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> You just know  Like love and hate you just know
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> just wait for him when he says come on we go out side
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> BUT, many people didn't get married to the one they REALLY love, because timing ain't right.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> it's not easy to make it to 10 years, so cheers for you!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> it is not like that at all.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> if you do have an older friends(like about 18 yrs old!

<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> How about ... Did you tell the people you care about the most that you love them?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> 4 who they are and that is my final answer!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> BUT THE POINT IS, YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE AND THAT MATTERS.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> i don't know the answer to this question, but the e-mail add i cheak the most would be, punkgirl_867@yahoo.com
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> k, well that was lame, anyway.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> if she/he wants an intimate dinner with family and close friends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> spanish boys cause i really love there stayle and they fun people to hang around
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> 2nd It's going to hurt regardless what you or her uses.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> We are friends but we just didn't click.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> And that's pretty hard to hide from close friends.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> next time you get that feeling tell her and say i am no longer comfortable dating you.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> you never forget someone that you love, you move on sometime, but never forget!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> U might can go right out your front door
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> I don't like both of them when it comes too much, too shy or too aggressive.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> never ever depend on a guy.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> He is not gay, don't ask!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Isin't it the other way around.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_30> he's not a friend if he dates her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> I AM THE ONLY CHILD BETWEEN THE 2 OF THEM.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> what i hate most about my companion is being boring!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> i mean just because he leaves there is not going to be this great calm life.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Honey, you can marry anyone you want.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> IT IS FINE.I HAVE BEEN MARRIED TO A BLACK GENTLEMAN FOR 15 YEARS.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> but she shouldnt rush u... if u need to think it over, then u should.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> If she comes back for more.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> yaa who need to talk to sexy one.. talk .. sexy is not to talk with
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> if its a boyfriend, then tell him ur breaking up with him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> THAT IS YOUR WISH..  WHAT IS YOUR QUESTION?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> i have to say thats an odd request.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> this is your friend here , there are a ton of guys ,, leave this onr alone !
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> fools  are a dime a dozen.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> if your heart beat get double to see someone like me!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> when ur close enough like hugging.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> if u have to ask then u r probably feeling guilty.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> Good Luck in the No Baby Making!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> how new is your relationship that your having sex and worrying about that already????
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> DON'T SHAKE YOUR ASS TOO MUCH.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_10> IS THERE ANYTHING WRONG WITH THROWING A NICE CEREMONY AND RECEPTION AFTER BEING TOGETHER 28 YEARS?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> break it to him gently... n hope that u 2 will b friends
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> if you need to, Tom at tlindsey3417 @ verizon.net

<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> WHERE GOD ALLOWS THINGS TO HAPPEN IN OUR LIVES TO DRAW US CLOSER TO HI..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> If he does so, have fun with it and say, Ohhhh?

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> Do not wait cuz he won't come trust me i know from expirience!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> these girls that yell are immature and silly and many man like that.

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> uhh....i dunno what you are talking about.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> then call him once he gives u his number.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> well do u see him looking at u at all?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> when you start looking you will find.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> go to nigeria, there are so many

<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> How can I Become a fool ?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Perhaps you could have asked to talk about it later, but that didn't happen.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i wish you joy, happiness & love.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> put out your hand, shake hers, and tell her your name.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> But it doesnt matter cause you already have gotten too caught up.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> No...  why do we have to be guilty?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_10> BT AS MY FATHER IS OPPOSING US HE'S LETTING ME GO.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> get a blood test done if its his baby drop both of them obviously they dont respect you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> just go ahead and ask her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> this other guy must be weird if your own flesh and blood thinks so.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Guys dig moms that manage femininity even with kids.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> When you dont have to ask this question.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> just ask, it wont help if you think about it so much.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> stop trying to make it work and let it work.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> or what if she maried someone else can you deal with that ?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> You, Do you shave your legs, my Juliet?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Just remember though, that good looking guy you're after is almost guarenteed to be ugly on the inside.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> if he never kissed a girl before then yall should wait until you are ready.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> They have creams for that now....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> He would have to be tall, handsome, have a shaved head, and a great personality!.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> is it for traction in the mud?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> and i don't want them to think im a hoe.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> you will find love eventually you just have to look for it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> AND DONT IF YOU DONT WANT TO, THE RIGHT TIME WILL COME.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> There's really no way that a guy could actually WIN most arguments with his girlfriend.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> Dont believe what you see in the porn flicks!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I don'tknow, why don't you ask him and find out!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> has she told you this or have you heard her plan this out my friend.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> MY FATHER IS FORCING ME TO MARRY SOMEWHERE ELSE IN 1 MONTH.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> good luk i hope u takemy advice or find wat ur looking for.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> they have to prove their manhood
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Hii..this is Kunal..i m from india..my email id neel_4_you@yahoo.com and the same one is chat id ..bye tc..
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> Dont hate me for being honest.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> to prevent you from gettin hurt jus try not to think bout it
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> if u want sex i think you should wait for 3 1/2-6 years
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> Sit her down, and be totally honest.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Get up, take a shower and turn on the tube!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> There are nice people, loving people, caring people out there.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> BESIDES, WE HAVE A HUGE FAMILY...HOW COULD THEY DECIDE WHO CAN BE THERE AND WHO CANNOT.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> you dont have to be in love, you just have to enjoy the guy that you are with.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> Staying with a guy you didn't love only makes both of you resentful at the end.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> bad sex is like bad pizza even when its bad its still pretty good.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> If he doesn't understand u then try conciling,and then if that fails........leave.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> I've never loved a guy but that didnt stop me!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> If there was he wouldn't be your ex.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> You better get far away and act like you don't speak english!!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> go to marriage counseling.. get a book about it...tell him its you or the drugs
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> Because we don't want to date a man.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> I agree with ^, if you have to..........RUN!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> You're not doing something the way she likes  3.)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> women use it to punish guys..by getting them all worked up..then saying NO...  women abuse it  !
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> the biggest turn on is to me a mature, self assured man with a purpose in life.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Then off that list pick 2 reasons that you can tell her about.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> i think it weird and i would throw the flower away.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> Sorry kido...it just doesn't sound good.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> try to go out with someone else.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Do you really trust your mom?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> for a pearl u have to dip deep in side the sea
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> how can you tell if the guy you are seeing is into you?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> You just have to find the right girl.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> but do it quietly, if he is cheating you will catch him sooner or later.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> dont 4get the girl aint a guy!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> DON'T GO LOOKING FOR TROUBLE, BECAUSE YOU WILL FIND IT!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> or is it something you just don't understand or never experienced?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> The bigger the girl the better!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> Never liked younger girls even when I was young.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> THEN AGAIN, I SAY SEEK GOD and pray for him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> You just have to take it slow and make sure the girl is ok with it.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> or set-up a nanny system to watch the boys until you get home .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if it goes later than that than move on.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> ok.. are u and your girl/boyfriend dating for a long time?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Females: You are always ready to get married,  why not, worst case scenario you get half!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> Thats the best gift any one can ever get.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> where would be a good place to start?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> its  not taken oraly it called bank statment.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> they complain and get on your back .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> you need to find out what's goin on with dude.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> but it can be done .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> She and i are still friends and I still love her truly madly deeply.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> !, don't be selfish, look out for her needs, lead her, lead the family, don't be lazy!!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> but i dont how to say that or apologize.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> IF GUYS COMMENT ON YOUR BODY AND YOUR FIGURE THEN BE PROUD OF IT.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> remember that she wants to get married.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> I hate it when guys are too into hanging out with their guy friends.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> BUT ITS PROBABLY MORE EFFECTIVE IF U DO IT URSELF!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> tell 'em to shut up and go away or for more peaceful setting just shoot em
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> number 2 American all the way
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Stop and think why does baking or cooking have to be a 'girl thing'?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Okay, so the guy I liked moved away.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> do help out each other and go for what u realli want.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I don't know what to do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> why in the world are you with him then???
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> talk to them, but don't spill your heart out until  you get a good feel  on how they think!!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> like   if  she  keep on  looking  at you  like do u have a  callwith  her ?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> But I'm not looking for no type of boy or man..
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> I was 15, at the beach, with a boy I wanted for my boyfriend.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> maybe if you ask him then he can show you few a pointers on how to kiss him.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> getting the job done right.... Honey, tonight i will get it done right, so i dont need you :)
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> I now live with them, and well I'll tell you this Once a cheater, always a cheater.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> Lucky who knows that in advance!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> we have been dating for about 7 weeks....help!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I still don't trust him even though he says he loves me
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> first ask her if there is a problem.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> maybe  your not sensitive    and take more baths
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> i have a boyfriend and he is fine
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> not good for you or your baby!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Yes unless it puts someone in harms way!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Hmmm...You could always do a tried and true method.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> things a little girl doesn't normally know but are fed to her by a bitter ex!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> they may not be exactly who you hoped for...you don't need to rush things.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> but if it was like three weeks after then i don't know what to tell u
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Sometime you have to take a chance on love and everything good dont feel great.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Give her time to make her own mind up.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> you don't know.so start conversations with her.tell her hey or hi or wuz up.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> don't know so why are you asking me?
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> dont you do that you might embarass her too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> There's an old joke that goes like so:  Q: Why do girls fake orgasms?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Personally, I don't think it matters.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> Hope she cheats on him on their wedding night... hehe  Kinda funny just thinking about it!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> They have flowers, stuffed animals, balloons and all kinds of gift baskets.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> nothing more to it than that.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> You can't love somone untill you love yourself first.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> but can i live _without_ this person for the rest of my life?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> SHE/HE WAS RIGHT AT THE TIME.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> If you love him, the ring doesn't matter...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> IF YOU CAN'T TAKE THE HEAT... GET OUT OF THE KITCHEN.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> but i agree, some girls are mean, mean...sluts!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> being like him will not make you have any more fun, trust me on this one.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> ... depends on the match... probibly not tounge...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> But other wise, no it's not
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> If they cheat WITH you, They'll cheat ON you!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> She has read but wants to learn pain/pleasure and experience sub space etc.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> It was war and it was Hell!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i dont care if he's a black or wut as long as i love him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> there are lots of boys that like loud, funny, smart and sporty girl :)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> She has started TALKIN' to that guy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> yep, under the stars.. movie theater, pool, hot tub, bed, car.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Think of it like this u live together already.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> Best of luck to both of you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> If this guy does not and refuses to let you have fun then he is not worth it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Thats like saying hair on his d**k is unattractive and him shaving it off.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> plus if they give you to much trust, people often abuse it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> ive just descibed myself , and i know im a good girl !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> youve got to be more spacific
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Dont knock it til you've tried it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> You want to help him, huh?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> if he goes crazy for something then do it and he might not even care about the pantyhose.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> Look to see where her hands are.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> do you give them the eye or are you just friendly?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> Then find out if you are OK with it, and then go for it or get the heck out!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> At mid 50, that thing is probably not working like it used to.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> yes, just go straight to the judge.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> is it because of his girlfriend?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> it's not how big it is it's how you use it
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> I do prefer Aggressive guy than Shy guy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> Did he have a bad childhood?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> FETISHISM ... is it a problem?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> Ofcourse you are if the avatar looks like you
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> friends with benefits I guess  that would be the only reason I see is she gets it from them
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_15> In God's name - NO SHARING!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> What is it that girls look for in guys?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> u must have to be expert in lying
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> Um... look the guy up and down then say, 'hey, how you doin'?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> with just home all the time and doing what you want.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> it would so be jesse mccartney
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> oh it sounds like this yahoo question anwser is converting into forums.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> the BEST way is to tell him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> i consider myself ready when i have 1. a college degree 2. money
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> tell her u didnt mean it that way.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> and nary a hair on her head.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> its better than have loved because if u didnt than u wouldnt know what love felt like
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> they cant make you stay married, thats what i did, and we got it done.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> You cant make a guy like you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> this kind of thing takes time and if u love her and she loves u then u will know!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> AND they will ALL want him!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> it was the truth and she backed off.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> take time to take ur decision
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> yes & you men never no the difference.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> If no, why don't u do it?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> bkuz thats how it iz  guyz do hav sik mines n itz normel
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I'm led to believe that my girl is cheating on me...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> many people got married because their biological clock is ticking, so they get hitched to the one they love.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> I'm a girl and I don't get it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> i would post more, but everyone here at Y!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> I know no women whom think that is sexy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> it depends how long was the break between her ex and u ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> you know small talk.let it flow.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Tell her to consult 'Dear Abby'.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> (He asked me out 5 years ago)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Yes..that is rule #1 in girlfrienddom..i don't care what the age is...you just dont do it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> dude, just think of her negative actions.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> BEEN CHEATED ON SO MANY TIMES BY MY HUSBAND THAT I KNOW EVERY EXCUSE THERE IS...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> stupid is as stupid does   momma says
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> If it is then going w/ him will not be a very good idea
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> i would probably just get caught looking at him a lot.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> well i think it is important for both of them.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> you dont see him, you dont really communicate to him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> bcs today i just knew what its means by bad girl ...!!!!!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Yes I seem to think so
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> sometimes it is best to wait, until you are sure
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> keep trying and one might stick.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> every one says they have a boy friend or a gilrfriend...
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> You need to get some marriage counseling pronto!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> you cant feel it at the moment.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> ---  well, that should get the ball rolling.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Or I just get a b -day present of valentines day present!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> if you love him/her...why not... we were not meant to be alone in this world
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> If he becomes sad, say you will (can, don't HAVE TO) be friends.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Consider yourself LUCKY and quit bitchin'!!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> But I hate it when a guy cant even remember their girls birthday or remember valentines day or christmas.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> I ask her to do things with us she always refuses.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> im in texas and all the gay guys hang on montrose
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> i love ya'll single and 16
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> If not your dad, a brother, old highschool friend, whoever!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> something like  So if i asked you out would you say yes?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> Just stay cool and just hang out with him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Not sure she would WANT to marry a guy that is 7 years older than ME!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> or maybe then ask yourself; 1. why does my husband wants a mistress?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> Girl dumb that zero and find a hero.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> well im mad at my friend whos goin out wit my ex.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> You should just be very honest - not mean!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> START SLOW AND FASTER SLOW THEN FASTER.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> then why would you have sex with this person ?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> Plus thicker women tend to have big booties and big ol boobies for more sexual fun.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> im sorry but that is hilarious!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> ok...i live in SC, United States, im 14-15 and a gurl.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> I don't want to be rude but you are going to propose to your bf??
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> To keep your mind off of it you need to move on.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> maybe you haven't found the ONE for you yet....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I kissed my hubby when we were dating!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> WE BOTH LOVE EACH OTHER VERY MUCH.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_20> WELL MOST DUDES LOVE 2 GET THEIR DICC SUCKEDOR BUY THEM A XBOX 360
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> single  divorced  looking  for  a  gf ;-)))
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> If you want him to calm down sit down with him and talk to him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> that is sick,might i add- illegal in most states!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> sit him down and ask him to tell u what he feels about u. dont delay to do this.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> SORRY, I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> dont listen to your sister just make sure you dont mess up the dress and everything will be fine
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> you will just know if ya ain't ready then ya ain't ready.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_20> haha..age aint nuttin but a number
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> u should be more discriptive dear .
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> and she wouldn't travel taht far to visit if she doesn't care about you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> One more thing, If you've really had enough, don't get divorced.... Get God!
<NbChars_315> <LevSim_25> i think its worth it !
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_15> YOU CAN FIND THEM IN SAN-DIEAGO CA,
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> dont be afraid ma, being shy cant hold u bac from hollering at a guy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> You need to get to know him a little bit more, alot more seems more like it!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> GUYS HAVE A HARD TIME PROCESSING THINGS LIKE THAT.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> why does it always seem that there aren't any good people out there??
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> talk to him alone and see if he says anything
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> IF YOU DO......DON'T PRESENT YOURSELF AS A EASY GO-ER OR ANYTHING.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> I find it doubtful that she hates you for no reason at all.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> That's wat i think and i just turn 17.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> so try using some Honey vs Vinager.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> my man would rather have a gurl thats thick and about 5 foot 5
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> But she didn't make any call.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> use your common sence here (strange relationship ) or not , something is not right .
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> umm on the beach silly i mean your in hawaii!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> He is just using words to get into your pants!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> well if u want to find out u could always ask his friends.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Just take a deep breath and do it!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> if you really LOVE  why you want to Forget??
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> he does.. rest assured he does.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> I guess it depends on who you ask?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> Oh well, let them learn the hard way.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Is it blondes, reds, burrnettes, or even the neon color haired girls?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> im a guy, yes, yes that is.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> hotness, i look for smarts, and intelligence.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> DO NOT LET SOME ONE USE YOU!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> but dotn take too long cause she wants to know.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> because you have to do it one day.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> Like look at prostitutes they have mare then anyone else.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> Duh...you just found that one out!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> I DONT HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> afraid 2 say that only time will heal your heart.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> BE YOUR SELF AND HOPEFULLY THE RIGHT GUY WILL COME ALONG
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> Some women experience no pain whatsoever ( I personally didn't) and some women have found it very painful.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> I don't like porno grphic movie but in the middle of decent movies, i find sometimes sex.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> older women are better in the bedroom trust me on that one.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> those are the things they look for in them.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Don't marry this guy just because he is coming to visit!
<NbChars_40> <LevSim_20> A fruit cake....Naw seriously I know of women that are like that.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> if you move closer to her and she doesnt pull away.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> being yourself is the best tip for attracting a girl
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_15> PORN IS NOT FOR A FEMALE THAT RESPECTS HERSELF,HER FEELINGS,HER BODY,AND HER PARENTS IF THEY SEE IT.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> think about the day you will meet your maker!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> for girls who have asked out guys before
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_45> You all can go to hell!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> that's when you either move or find a new circle of people to hang out with.)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> Help me I can not stop thinking about her she means alot to me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> AND... he'll know you've got kids and not hold it against you!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> it depends on the height of the girl.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> Well umm.. ok first if I was u I wouldn't take any medicines.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> Well..its the little things that he may do.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> but you have to acccept that, tht girl did not choose  to be bald..
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> if u noticed u probley couldnt stand being alone!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> if that doesnt work then u could try to tell her that u dont like him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> WHEN THE PENIS IS TOUCHED, I CONSIDER IT AN ACT.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> If your not comfortable with it then dont.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> it's not the size of the wave...its the motion of the ocean that counts
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> what the hell are you talkin about
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> He didn't ask me out becuase we are 'just friends.'
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> Look at things honestly and you can feel it!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Whay the need to get mardid at that young age.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> you can get over on any man you choose with a bubble
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> some don't like sporty girls because they don't want you to be better than them.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> There are other tale tale signs....nipples harden, lips swell(top and bottom ones!)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> DISEASES....do you know where her friend has been?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> ?I'm not saying be naive and a doormat.. i don't think you would have that in you anymore.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> sure stay of the booze and enjoy reality.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> think of stuff or do stuff that makes u happy.. like maybe sewing...riding horses...watching a classic movie... e.t.c.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Please if there is a God tell me you are kidding.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> it's not the looks their after, it's what's inside that counts... sorry for butting in...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> They're like aliens that can't understand you, and you'll just think, Duh!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> hey am sorry buh i tryed everywhere and i cudnt find him phone number... sorry again!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> and have her pay child support .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT WHAT IS REAL LOVE ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> Just how old are you and maybe I'll think about it
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> if he MOVES there then yeah i would move on yourself.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_10> SHE SHOULD LEARN HOW THINGS WORK ROUND THERE 1ST
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> You seem like me from that little bit.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> But, I wouldn't have sex with him until we got married!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> so beware before doing anything stupid.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> there's a lot to be said for foreplay
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> YES IT IS VERY POSSIBLE TO BE IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE OTHER THEN THE ONE YOU ARE WITH(SPOUSE).
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> But have to only choose 1!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> and if there not then atleast they know not to even think of cheating because thell lose!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> It worked for my mom and dad.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> She would tell people that I was pregnant (which I am not).
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> no just don't have sex into its the right time
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> Talk to them, but if you can wait, until your mature...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> fall in love with another and you'll forget all about him.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_25> LOve i m in mumbai india plz rep
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> A friend is someone that going have ur back no matter what during the tough things and good times.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> you'll know it's love guys if they're not afraid to cry to you.....
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> i have no idea..tell me what it is once you have the answer lol
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Like a guy you went to school with.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Wait til you're married to the one of your dreams!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> BUT there are plenty of guys out there who are, just keep you chin up.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Because GOD showed us his love through Jesus Christ
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I mean its like, specially th guys only hav one thin on ther minds.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Like a guy you went to school with.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Wait til you're married to the one of your dreams!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> BUT there are plenty of guys out there who are, just keep you chin up.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Because GOD showed us his love through Jesus Christ
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> I mean its like, specially th guys only hav one thin on ther minds.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Screaming and moaning is usualy fake.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> ask your girl or wife to do it for you..it's free and easy if they're not cam shy
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> he is still mad at me and he has been for 5 years now.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Just make sure it is a guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> so that there are chats & back-biting between chicks & rarely u see that in guys!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> When I do, it's just for a second or two while she's walking (normally she's with friends).
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> !THE GREATEST PLACE TO HAVE FUN!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> she who doesnt care others feelings and dont value the ppl who cares for her!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> your sick, youre probably the cause of the divorce.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_20> in a matter of time .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> It just means you are not in love.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> if you like that girl or you love her, tell her and if she loves you she'll tell you.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> 1. how much fun a person has depends on the individual, not hair colour.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> and yet they keep going on?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> I thought I had learned my lesson, boy was I wrong..
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> I can't seem to let her go...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> Just wait     --you'll find that one and only soon enough!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> will he try to talk to u much ?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> She is your ex so don't worry about it.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> Just make small chit chat and hang out with her.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> it hurts and it is wierd and you get uncomfortable.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> forget about z bad things and keep moving slow good luck
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> just say stop u dont like smothering that much
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> i cant drive just yet, and my bf si 16. can anyone help me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> if u r thinking of only 1 person all the time.then it's love.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> I would try to come up with an excuss but i can't.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_20> there really isnt any way to avoid the pain..........its gonna hurt.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Need to get my Butt offline
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> You don't need a spell but you do need to spell it out to your wife him or me.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> If you need to ask the it is time to go.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> who's telling you, that u should.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> :) I don't think there is one moment when you wake up and *know*.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> That's the worst thing you could do.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> And tell you how much you like her and y you like her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> Don't say he's just a friend if he's not.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> Just say that u dnt want to date, But still want to be friend's.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_45> genuises are hard  to come by.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> im afraid that i might break my boyfriends heart if i want to go with my crush.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> But you should be able to tell it like it is.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> i've known several happily married couples who met that way.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> Pick up your socks, quit your crying and go and read a book...or something.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> look for signs like her caring about u or acting more kind towards u.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> shake it and use it and make them happy doing it!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Listen to what she has to say and what she doesnt say, Treat her like a princess
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Of course ur ready to go with him.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> If not... well then she's not worth your time and patience.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> It's not my fault, he says.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> Tell him your giving him a seventh year?!?!?!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> i like both names, its hard 2 pick.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> GO FOR A MATURE, HONEST MAN.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> because he's not that into you, just like when you tell a guy you'll call him.... you dont...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> agbaya... u should kno better than that
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> No need to over think it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> I am so scared to get married again...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> change ur mind and ur thoughts dear
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> There is if you want it to be.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> when you get all scared around who you like
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> first u should apolojyse than at lease get 2 know each other.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Your so cute and u should have a boyfriend if u don't have one!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> no offense, but this strikes me as an incredibly bad idea.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Um MsLadie, that is how you spell come youre probably thinking cum LAY
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> No, you should not cheat on him.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> Go head boo n do ur dizzle.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> then not to mention what happens to the kids?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> But afterwards i want to puke.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> with the warranty or u no wat?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> you'll be doing both of you a favor.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> Find somebody else that you could love.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> when you turn 18, no one will care how old the guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> there is no security in that.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> omg i am from utah i visit my dad there
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> The world is FULL of nice men.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> Good luck, and smile alot, but most important, just be who you are!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> ...which happened to be y'alls too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> They actually do fake orgassms if you don't do a good job in bed.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> the main question is , is it normal to feel insecure when with her together because of her past?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> But we have always made it.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> i do not know what to tell my bestfriend.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Right now, you just need to be a friend.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> Ask him if he wants to quit.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> Pester her for more info, or what?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> Please help, it's bugging me every day!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> sweetbreeze is on the money  you are in LOVE -- he is in LUST
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> That ought to do the trick...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> save yourself for someone who cares about you.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> how old are you then i will answer
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_20> it looks like u r on crack ugly!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> Is he having an affir now??
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> well if you are able to go places then go.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> OR MAYBE YOU ARE JUST NOT WITH THE RIGHT ONE.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> plz tell me what should i do.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Others gush with orgasims...everyone is different!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> but they don't need to scream.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> how do you know anybody else loves you?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> I don't know who this profile fits but if you know of one give him my address !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> i think josh is a better name than kyle go for josh girl!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> we (my bf&me)r ready for sex, we just need to get our hands on some protection.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> If you think he's worth it, then sure
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> if with time u forget the person then it's crush.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> hispanic fathers tend to frown upon that sort of thing.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> to have someone else to love you exept your family.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> I was just wondering about this.. please find out for me.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> If he doesnt like it thats his problem he isnt living his sons life.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> Whatever you do, don't test him, guys HATE that.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> i would do anything for either one.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> If he is a good man talk about your problems.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> if you wish big, and you get small then that matters because it was an undisirable effect, and viseversa.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I like watching football but my husband doesn't.
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_20> what does a one-night stand mean to you?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> only the busy guys are too busy
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> to be frank, you sound like a fool.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> HE IS BLACK AND ABOUT 29 YEARS OLD AND DID BASIC TRAINING AT FT JACKSON IN SOUTH CAROLINA
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> well i will stay out of and then wait so you could say i told you so.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> heels, they tell what type of girl is she.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> ask him or have one of your girl friends ask him..
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> im in atl.. did he travle ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> obviously you need to 1. get honest with yourself about who you are.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> Baby Steps   What About Bob-the movie
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> this question is kinda hard to explain but trust me if you are ready then ya will know.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> No, I do not have a boyfriend
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> Which is okay its just that I realized that we are not like what we used to anymore.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> So to make both of you happy, why won't you get engaged?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> you know what, read between the lines!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> I too have 2 young girls 1 & 3.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> idk...experiment with vibrators, touching during sex and idk go to cosmoplitan for answers they usually have good stuff.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> He`s at home with his wife in THEIR bed right now.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> OK, take your kid(s) to the park on a Saturday or Sunday.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> nothing like cuddling up, on a cold day, to a furry guy!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> stay inside and keep your clothes on.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> dont be afraid to make the first move.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> there's no easy way just tell them
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> She gets upset because they spend alot of time with me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> thats just the way parrents think.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> well  its something someone says when you see a butt like that
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Drink... or vent about it to a stranger...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> If he sounds like a rooster
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> We broke up because I dont trust him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Easy, you go up to her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> how do you know your wife is going there.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> when you know he/she is the one and you love him/her very much!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> Its been 5 yrs for me too.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> It just comes and stays there forever and if it doesn't then it's not really true love ;)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> maybe you are asking them question that are personal
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> things change i dont know where any of my old friends are even at its life priortys change.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> Tell her to be an adult and get over it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> MY DAD SAYS IT IS WHATEVER MY MOM WANTS.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> he would be in pain but that would be ok. i would get to see how he takes stress.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Thats a tough one, my girlfriend complained for me snoring.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> Sure buddy, as long as your not some kind of a phsyco in rubber gloves.. varkiemina@yahoo.com
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> I asked myself questions, like, Am I going to miss out on other guys/opportunities if I get married?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> But what if she likes what you said, what next?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> i mean what if she moves before you ask?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> i dont think kissing someone would make someone think you're a hoe.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> 9 years without dates or sex or anything.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> i think it depends on your waist size and how big your butt is.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> just do him and tell him that this what he will be missing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> MY advice is dont have more kids.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> If you betray her confidence its bad but if you dont tell her parents it could be worse.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Do you mind if I use it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> or  Your father likes her and your mother doesn't.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> well, how do u make him feel loved?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> Guys think with the wrong head.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> DISEASE, DEATH, GUILT, REGRET, PREGNEANCY, SO MANY ENJOYMENTS.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> If he is surprised, Ask him is it wrong to like someone?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> you shouldn't come on too hard but, you should ask him out but not too forceful or pushy.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> if he approaches you that way tell him that he's not wut your looking for.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> (2) if she felt the same way as you do bout her... your missing out on a lot.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Keep getting Stuck and Dont know what 2 say.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> get his mind off of it by doing things beside sitting around.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> well you should be glad because first of all you aren't black .
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> It probably means you don't find her attractive, you're desperate.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> Kinda like leasing w/ option to buy.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> You may not like him in person, anyway!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You can tell her, (name here), I like you more than a friend.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> well if u think ur ready.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> ok i am not a physco i am just kidding.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> visit park, meuseums, zoo,zoological gardens cienema houses
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> best friend are always the best mate, you already know everything about them.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> you can learn a lot about a person when they get hurt.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> and spend the rest of your life only with your kids  good luck
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> but she is completely unstable now with two failed marriages .
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Because to me seems like she does that always.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> with a possesive attitude like that no wonder she / he does not.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> Be her friend but most importantly be you!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> nooo you are not stupid, if you stay with him you will just be hurting yourself.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> u can get some good friends on net.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> If he treats you and your kids great... wonderful!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> because our heart are always looking for something new  guys and girls too.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> I hope she (mom) finds out because then you can say I told ya so.....good luck!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> Don't you know the answer to that since your the one married to her.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> a hint of advice: don't let it go by
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> and that i was to wrapped up in this other guy to really like her boyfriend.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> heh...ive already got 1 and im in cali.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> hmmm, when will i know when i'm ready?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> 2nd time he asks, say: Well, I like you, but not in that way.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> DO NOT PICK A PLACE WHERE YOU COULD BE SEDUCED.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> and about your crush, why is he heart broken?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> listen, the best way is to go tell him that u like him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> TRY NOT TO THINK TOO MUCH!!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_10> SAY HEY (PERSONS NAME) I THINK U ARE REALLY HOTT.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> It did feel good & hubby did a lot of forplay before hand.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Having sex and giving birth isnt all peaches & cream like most put it!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> But if you take it I will hunt you down like a beast!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> Are you brain dead or what....

<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> sometimes we get sick of waiting around for ya, too, so ya better hurry up and go get her!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> I waited until I graduated from h.s.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> If so, my email is notsayin82@yahoo.com  I might be her boyfriend...
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> if ur asking and can't tell than she probably doesn't and if she does she'd show it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> tell her your feelings and see what she replies
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> a little get together then theys party
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> because we want to show u off to people  women r the same way
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_35> hell yes because if you don't you'll be kicking yourself really REALLY H A R D
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> what's the difference between me and a name of the flirtiest guy you ever know!!!??
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> I'm a blonde, and I have tons of fun:-)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> Debby: I don't know if you believe in God, but...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Think about that then ask her!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> guys just have a primal urge and they need it..no game along with it..just need it.period..
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> You're first time u not going to go that long.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Will your BF stay with you if you don't have sex with him?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> your not listening to your head .
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> send a note his way and see whats comes up
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> and i tried telling my m0m but she doesnt belive me
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> When there is so little doubt, you don't feel the need to ask that question (serious not sarcasm)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Well I find boys very atracted to me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> ;-) but consider it a compliment.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> ...gave you a flower just to brighten your day, and then walked away without asking you for your number?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> It's not attractive but I don't want my man to ever shave his.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> be understanding and give it another shot maybe call her up?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> I can't reveal too much, as to there might be women reading this.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> depends on how old you are....
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> I Just love having sex with them, they feel even more femenine than some women.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> Yeah, a lot of women fake...There could several reasons...
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_40> and if you want to take another step don't be afraid to ask her out.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> or tell you that you have two hands do it yourself.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> which means 1 out of 2 get divorce .
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> i havent yet and im turning 16 next month.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> if you really love the person you can't just forget them.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> The man replied: Oh thank God!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> Dump her, dump her, dump her.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> You are freaking gay or lesbian.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> YES EVEN IF IT WILL MAKE THERE LIFE BETTER.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> i think ive given enough info this time.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> lot harder to just bare it then..
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_10> LET HIM KNOW THAT YOU ARE FEELING UNCOMFORTABLE, AND YOU WOULD LIKE TO WAIT.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> or what if she's asked by a guy SHe really likes?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> But, if he lies and doesn't do anything at all.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> if u say it is ^_^
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> live your life for yourself not for him, thats what he's doing.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> whatever country you want replaces the question mark
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> give a guy a chance...you never know what you may find.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Why do guy say they will call then never do.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> how do u deal with your spouse beig away?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> Shorter guys like shorter girls so their the taller 1 in the relationship.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Think about these 2 things: 1.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> or Would you like fries with that?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> I paint them because I like to see my pretty toes I do it for me
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> but as the other guy put it, love knows no boundries.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> do u write letters and send packages?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> You did'nt mention what the trouble is....... good luck

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> I have pepper spray but I can't spray it or else I'll get into trouble.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> without you and then expect her to be o.k.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> and i hope you dont have children .
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_35> when you find the love of your life.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> Go up to her and say somehting like Excuse me, I'm a bit lost.

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> And ALWAYS remember this phrase: If you love it, set it free.

<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> don't go back for the childrens sake.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> I have 3 kids and we have 1 together.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> if your honest and carefull it can work!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> That is just their nature I guess.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> Ans: there is no perfect guy.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> But keep in mind that finding someone you recognize as the person of your dreams is very very difficult!

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Too much too soon is bad.

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> sit them down with your intended and just tell them...or don't tell them till u elope....
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> thats all you need is trust

<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> I say don't play games in a relationship.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> i don't know what he's trying to do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> and below the belt wants a hottie, it's a sad fact.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_45> b&d=bondage and discipline s&m=sadism and masochism
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> you've got to know someone before u develope love for that person.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> please give me your comment on this one.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> COLLEGE IS HARD, AND WORKS SUCKS!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> i probably am going to anyways so i just want opinions
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_10> TOO MUCH DRAMA, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> you will find somebody as great as her who will not ditch you or use you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> Ignore here and see what happens, if she asks you if something is wrong then your in there.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> i do have a boyfriend and he is the cuties guy ever but sometime's he is am ass.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> it's a smooth move i've seen played many times before
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Will try 2 talk 2 whenevr he/she sees u.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Very abnormal and silly i might add, because what kind of female dont wanna kiss her man?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Ok I know this answer because I take a psychology class!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> simply because it feels good or that it's painful in a good way
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> Then again, she doesnt want kids, so shes not the ONE.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> What if you had a chance to go out with one of your friends ex's?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Aslo you cant want it too badly.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> u remind me of my mother na just playin.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> There ARE good guys out there!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> me and my man and nomore
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Chin-up, it could be alot worst.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> He was so mature when we started he just seems to be missing out on something.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> So perhaps we'll say, I'm so glad we're friends.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> of course they r great lovers they have chinky eyes (630)220-0996
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> normally, i don like touch, i................
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> truly kind and caring people aren't as common as it seems.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> anyway, good luck to both of you and hope you hit it well!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> tell him you got another date!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> come on, this situation is not fair to the girlfriend and it is defintely not fair to you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> we get along well but i think i am to old for her .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> wanted to ask her out but I am shy dmmit!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> stay funny and smart and loud (thats me!!)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> So, I guess you surround yourself with the wrong peoples!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> have you ever seen an inbred person?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> That is sort of how guys are.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> I'm pretty shy around him and he probably thinks I'm crazy but he's so smart and so cute!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> I guess you just have to keep on looking and the right guy will come soon.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> She doesn't like you, so you can stop wondering.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> He'  my one and only love.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> girls have half the money and all the p****
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> NOPE not me hate the movie but allways Romantic baby
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> i have stopped looking ^_^  seriously
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> I dated this girl from my work once and it led to well use your imagination.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> Huh or how can i get them together?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> And then last year he dumped me for good.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> You can IM me at lil_nemo_2005
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> porn is disturbing n its definatly BAD in dating... its almost liek cheating on ur bf/gf
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> no male armpit hair is not attractive at all
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> But some stuff it just can't help you with.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> our relationship is better & i feel better at work because i dont let things get to me anymore.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> have you ever asked on how the marriages ended?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> Constantly wanting to hang all over me and baby talk to me, ya know...that sort of thing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> some guys like sporty but some don't.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> I don't date work 60 plus hours and with kids the rest of the time.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> listen to what your heart tells u
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> But is there another good one, where people are more real????
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> just tell her in a sinsear way
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> I agree with once a cheater always a cheater.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> Go to one of the search engines(google,yahhoo etc) and type in PenPals in ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i think the little birdy...or muscle
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> AT THAT POINT I FEEL THAT THERES BEEN SOME ACTION.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> They also love guys who beg for sex.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Incest is always wrong - it's the kind of thing animals, not human beings, do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Or later on you realize that it really S ucks and you should not have commited this mistake?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> if you have to ask, you aint a master.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Girls why do you want a boy why not a man?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> no younger than 19, unless you have the urge
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> or is it just that you feel that way because you've got crap self-esteem and are depressed?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> then give her some feeling about u. and u should go with the girl u like.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> If he LOVED you as you claim you both do, he would not DO that to you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> i think you should totally ask him out cuz i'm pretty sure he likes you and will say yes!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> i have 20 friends do u watch lizzie maguaire?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> to be in a good mood start smiling and making conversations
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> No ofcourse, But if your husband/wife caught you then it is.. lol
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Ditto - he does - if he answers to the contrary - he's full of it!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> This lets me know this is a BIG deal!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> 14-15 is WAY TOO YOUNG to have sex...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> u  couyld  tell  really  easey   if  u do
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> Also, he cheated on me with her, so technically, should I feel bad for seeing him?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Everybodys first time sucks...and even on his third time he's still gonna suck, so I agree...he must be gay.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> so far I think they are the best...hmmm mmmm
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> i think know one knows until your in love its your  own opinion its what you fell
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> what do you get when you get married, that you don't get while you are not .
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> It's harder on the kids, but she needs to chill out!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> but it's not our age differance.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Figure it out - there is so much life out there.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> HARD WET NECK & BELLY KISSES NO FORPLAY.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> if you don't want to explain, so be it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Of course it feels good for boys Their pussy feels good.Are you a girl.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> and a smile to go with it all.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> maybe he wants to step it up a notch - y'know, marriage... or maybe he's sex starved.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> you'll know it when you find it.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> I guess my question is this: Is it worth giving it a go?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> I dont wanna be a genius anymore
<NbChars_265> <LevSim_25> He sucks more than you do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Later that day she tried to call me 17times but I didnot pick them up
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> That's the part that so many miss out on.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> just tell him.i dont like u anymore and leave me alone u freak!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> tell him your not ready and its not the best time and try again in a nice way
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> What i like is a boy that don't let his pants hang.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Their mother dated and married a guy they didn't like it lasted 3yrs and she is now divorced.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> If I could give you a hug I would....cuz I know I sure coulda used one then.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> u should get him superbowl tickets!
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_40> take the depo shot and don't tell him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> honest is always best it shows us where the real love is.
<NbChars_250> <LevSim_40> If you love him, say yes.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> Be romantic.....not the 'hey I got ya sum flowers' kinda thing.....lol.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> I guess why are you asking me this??
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> Ok i like tis guy who i go to school with.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> yes, hopefully hes hung and will love pleasing your wife.. whats your wife look like?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> we going to McDonalds baby and we getting 2 Big Macs
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> I like to touch the butt, and his manly package!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> anything can work out if you make it
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i tried to tell him why i did what i did and why i stopped.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> quit torturing yourself and using him ... move on
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> i agree, u should make him pay ur bills, but help him out in return.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_40> yes i like a few people why
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> tell him or her tha real love set the partner free
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_65> ask him to bring back tacos.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> Forget it......................or you could look at magazines
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> Love on him and give him lots of attention.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> Better put this one on my Watch List...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> If he wants a  mistress, he does not deserve you!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> i am looking forward to do this...
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_50> if all fails see a specialist
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> i would drop a barbell on him and then he would have to talk to me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> But reassure them she still loves them...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Am I the only one on ehre that likes armpits??
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> MY BROTHER IS OLDER BUT HE STAYS FOR HIS GAMES
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i can get it though should i do that and call back or wait till be calls back ?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> I'm just saying this because what he did was NOT YOUR FAULT!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> whoever answered bed sure has some loose screws =p i'd say go to a theme park.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if he can do that, then everything else falls into place i think...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> cos u dont need to worry about how ur goin to live on for ur next part of live.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> age dont matter its whenever you get MARRIED!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> So far I hooked up two friends with my advice!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Find a guy your age, or just wait 5 years...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> If not, hunt it down and kill it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i don't believe in backstabbing for a guy, but she thought i meant it that way.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> It's because you probably come off like a lil' sister, or a buddy.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> Are you guys gay or what?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> DONT TALK TOO MUCH JUST HOLD HER HAND AND GO AHEAD IN ACTION .. MAKE SURE YOU ARE ALONE
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> my boyfriend said the same to me when i feel sad at work.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> follow your heart...no one can force u to do anything u are an adult
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> well it actually depends on the situation.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> If he can't respect that you deserve better!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> take the time necessary to be sure what a life long committment really is all about.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> the sad part is that we are both to shy to do anything!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> hey I'll be one if you want
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> I don't need a super good-looking guy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> but he said that he would still continue to help me.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> Read He's Just not that Into You...It gives  you lots of advice about what to look for.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> If she isn't willing to clean up, then move on.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_25> If he gets mad, tell him like it is.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> Sounds to me like you are hit s*x puppet.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> Might be so for you not so for many other small men though Give it a try
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Save sex until you are married, keep it for that one special person in your life.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> i would like to know his name :) to thank him, thats something sweet to do for a stranger.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> it all depends on how spicy you want it to be...theres a world of sweet perversions out there =)
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_40> I don't know, you should def.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> so go for it and let them!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> need good friends from all over the world and we will make a great fun i promise.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> Just pick up ur pieces fast and move on.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> HOWEVER YOU OUT GREW YOUR SPOUSE.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> It falays you up and cuts deep!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> If you care for him, why break up?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> SIZE DOES MATTER, IM TOO BIG AND SO IT HURTS THE GIRLS, I HONESTLY WISH I WAS SMALLER.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> so calm down and realax only u will know when u r ready!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Because I never choose to stay close to the person I dislike.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> but you might gain something antibotics cant rid.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> keep this outlook and you'll get further than they ever would.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> if your not mad then dont be mad.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> i did, i broke up with my boyfriend but regret it later.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> it depends on if you make it last.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> ignor him that is probably what the girls that he had sex with told him he was.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> For me though if I had to choose just one it would be romance for sure .
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> If you love one another you stick it out anyway.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> People think that it's weird but so what its what i like and what i like is NOONES buisness!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> But things are not always going to feel this bad.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> dont talk about old guys you dated or marriage and you should see an answer here soon.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I do not hate my spouse!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> well u should let them kno the real u good luck
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> trust me i was there 20 years ago.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> gosh , that name sounds so familiar !
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> in the movies we see all this great time for your first time.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> the question is not can i live _with_ this person the rest of my life?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> is it fare you you do love the person the same way they love you?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> older and younger i rather kids but like preteen their awesome specially if they r skateboarders
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> the short answer is that girls look for guys that make them feel good.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> Have you called him but did he always put you off or seem always busy?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> i am 9 years old and i have a crush on a 4th grader named james creater.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> No girl wants to push herself on a guy if he only sees her as a friend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> b/c if its peer pressure, then u should just ditch those friends.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Well why didn't you say so earlier!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> 26-39 A pickup truck filled with Coors!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> I so know how it feels to be hung up on a guy, its no fun.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> You'll never forget it...Will the next guy do this too?...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> !LIVE FOR YOURSELF quit wasteing time with him!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> yes , do you like being sick ?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> No they probably don't, because we don't!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> I can say one thing you think big..Lady
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> Unless you had a Mini Cooper and her legs wouldn't fit.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_20> i dont know but talk to me
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> If youre not married, it's flat out WRONG.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> older, i rather someone that will teach me than me having to teach someone
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> BE PROUD FOR YOUR PERSONALITY AND YOUR NICE FIGURE.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> he is a grown man and his father needs to see his son happy.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> U cant control ur feelings but u can control ur actions.Preserve ur dignity,move on and hope 4 the best.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> ask him can yall go out to a picnic or a restaurant or a movie or something.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> if it's not a great ending it's not the end keep ur head up!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> my advice, pick the one that is the cutest!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> and for the lady: take care of your man -- he won't admit it, but he's a big baby.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> i dont really think so it depends what size you are.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> 2. get out there and meet some new people.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> foreplay - to get you aroused faster.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> I am that kind of guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Cuddle, play, and lounge around a lot!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> The guy wants to marry her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> OR FRIENDS OR CHURCH MEMBERS HAPPEN TO BE ON INTERNET FOR OTHER PURPOSES AND A PORN SITE POPS UP.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I did bleed a little bit.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Tell him that you like him A LOT.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> Don't try to push the issue, have patience with him and give him time to learn to trust you.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> but just recently I just signed a lease and he signed it to.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> and everything checked out on each end.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> example: hey, i want to see that movie, too!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> explain it further... nobody seems to understand what you meant...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Mom, dad, (insert male name) asked me to marry him and I said yes.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> It's just something were going to deal with sooner or later girl!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> I called my daughtor and she cries out in my ear things that just rip a dad's heart out.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> for example, are there any phone calls the day after, no second date .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> This might be a big surprise to them, it might not.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> i feel that nobody in this world is that nice
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Don't allow her to play that way.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> If that don't work find someone to get him off your hands
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> lean on friends that is what they are there for.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> no not at all  go for it
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> i don't know hispanic gals but i guess that they like.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> if you want to call, so be it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> I've used mine all over the world.
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_30> I just start by asking some one out.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> you can't show that you love a little bit or alot.
<NbChars_255> <LevSim_30> First, you have to love YOU!
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_30> scent You know what I mean.
<NbChars_325> <LevSim_20> I love my mother so much.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> Wht do u do to make him feel tht hez important n special to u?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> You'll find a much better guy, I promise.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> well, flirting around with him and try to be friend first.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_10> YOU HAVE MORE RESPECT FOR YOURSELF THAN THAT......RIGHT.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> and ask her if you really want to know.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> You are above girlfriend my friend
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Your mother likes him and your father doesn't.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> Best of luck to you... hope that helps at all.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> At least I did when I was younger.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> I know what you're going thru.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> She will get over it much faster that way...and you can have fun doing it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> she may say that shes ok with this but chances are she wont be .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> it does get better but be prepared use protection and just enjoy yourself.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> Read my lips, this jerk just cheated on you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> first try to see whether he is the right person for u when u meet!then decide!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> She will get over it much faster that way...and you can have fun doing it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> she may say that shes ok with this but chances are she wont be .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> it does get better but be prepared use protection and just enjoy yourself.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Read my lips, this jerk just cheated on you.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> first try to see whether he is the right person for u when u meet!then decide!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Why don't you sit them down, and say I love you?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> I hope as her friend you can help her out.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> im 14, and catholic, and so far my parents havent told me im gunna go to hell
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> I hope you get asked to the by this guy.He really seems like a nice guy you know!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> do you love him and can you see yourself marrying him?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Ask him so many why's and if ur satisfied with his reply, go on what ur decession.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> but basically it would depend on your budget.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> Don't you just love it I made it up myself!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> Wow rocky.......you hit the nail on the head.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> u found the shortest way to hell if he doesn't divorce her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> bottom line.... you waited 4 years for the gutters.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> find another bf n just leave him goodluck
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_20> 5'4 with pinkish hair and im 15 yrs.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> I have to agree with bandnerd....a guy is NEVER worth 5 yrs of wanting and waiting...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> I am a real singel and I am looking for a real single too!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> I mean it helps keep our sex life interesting.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Ya, if you don't mind the itching.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Coz i feel so lonely in the school..
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> omg i think you have a mis understanding with you girlfriend
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> either that or it hurt her.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> 36 IS NOT TO OLD MY SISTER IN LAW IS 40 AND HAS ONE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just do it and then either way you know you honestly tried.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> my b/f was never like that.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> you take a day at a time and dont trust your head or heart for at least a year
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> people ask that question every ten minutes!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I say it depends on how much and where you're shaving!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> NO YOUR TOO YOUNG TO BE EVEN HAVING SEX.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Or if your friends are having sex dosn't mean you have to.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> With lovey dovey thoughts in mind.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> because they are already taken or they are gay
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> The guy's real sweet to me but I so want him bad.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> If she's not receptive, then don't waist your time.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> Don't worry, i like someone who is 9 years older, but i am legal now whoo-hoo!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> do something big fon her on Feb 14
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Theres even enough sperm in pre cum to get you pregnant.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_45> because it's another word 4 pants but 4 ladies underwear
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> actually men is more pro-active or most of the time the initiator.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> and yes, i do belive in true love, and soul mates.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> And SHE watches them more than he does!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> throw it out and get your husband to buy you a new one.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Hey I'm proud to be one!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> If u wanna tell her just tell her.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> thanks for inviting me to answer your ?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> it is not harmful in any way, buy some body pudding and eat it like it`s candy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> But alot of girls like roses, sunflowers, tulips, lilies, orchids, carnations..
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Cyber sex is just like phone sex.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Let them be friends with each other and buy a larger bed.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> im no expert, but i've been there.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> because ur MOM is ur only MOM.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> It sounds like maybe she is just upset because her other relationship didn't work out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT YOU BOTH LIKE AND GO FROM THERE
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> ya dude oxymoron safe uprotected sex
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> BUT WE HUMANS ARE SEXUAL BEINGS,AND THATS ALL GOOD.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> and he doesn't even kno that i exist!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> -Some guys also like books & magazines, posters & collectibles.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> some people don't have a problem swallowing and some do.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> After all, no matter what you do, his kids aren't going to dissapear.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> if its meant to be, it will be.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> I don't know who yours is, but I wonder if I'd ever have one.....
<NbChars_250> <LevSim_25> break up with him and never look back
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> but you can use your tongue to spit it out.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Just sit her down and tell her she'll be happy for you....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Only tell him if you think he feels the same way...
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_20> Just say no to baby momma drama.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> umm why do you need someone to be happy maybe thats your problem.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> go in slowly, then lots of pressure!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> you just have to ask her.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> name sounds familiar what about her?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> wut if we lernt to spel or make a setants
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> any real life experience that hunts u still.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> yes you should have someone do that for you
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> i know itll be hard but u cant hold on to her or ull never move on
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> to my enemies, i forgive you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> MAYBE THEY CAN CONVINCE YOU IT'S NOT THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> If can't handle something on my own, I'll ask (ex.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> I am a child of fortune or I am a loser?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> I think celibacy is NOT A WASTE OF TIME!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> so many things can happen that you are just not ready for.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> If he taking care of u a lot.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> A) Everyone is not doing it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> At least you will have fun, even if you dont find a wife!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> but try the mall or just looking around your own school.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> example: my grandmother died a year ago at the age of 103 she was like a mother to me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> IT IS NOT TRUE THAT MEN LIKE SEX MORE THAN WOMEN.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> And for a guy its vice versa.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> I would go with plan A---not all that--but great personality....  :-)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Would you grab the money and run up to the guy and hand it back to him?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_15> THEN IF YOU GUYS HAVE A LOT IN COMMON AND GET ALONG IT JUST MIGHT WORKOUT!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Then just say 'Will u go out with me?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> This might be the one for you!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> If ur that well built ,Why are u asking this question?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> bullets to the head are the awnsers to lieing in love.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> ull find that ur in love with him later!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> #2 no matter how old you are, always remember: An Ex is ALWAYS an Ex for a reason.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> nag him, if you aren't, maybe it's cuz they're too proud of themselves!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> do u mean passion with true love or chemichal passion(chemichal passion never lasts)
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> (20 year olds are in the prime, so they may be a wee bit wild.)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> when you are in love, you just know it.. you dont need others to confirm it for you!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> Kick him to the street... You're gonna have problems in your relationship with his ex still around...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> i still like her even though she's f**king one of my friends
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> at least youll know immediately if he cares about you also.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> Some ppl can go on being friends.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> but onething, you should see the size of the body also...  major guys doesnt like huge boobs.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> Four... 1)Positive--Oh, yes, oh, yes, yes, yes!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> you just have to go and be yourself.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> just ask, or maybe show them you care?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> does he appreciate you the right way?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> i think there is somethin wrong wit u. find someone ur age
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_35> i wont sugar coat it, you should never raise your hand in anger.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> yes because you are still a minor, and he could go to jail
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> Just talk to her since both of you like each other then you shouldn't get rejected
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> he cant make eye contact with you
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> i like smart, funny, sexy, out-going, and just knows how 2 have a good time kind of guy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> i agree with cowgirl and angel.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> It kinda makes the rest bearable, ya know?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> nope its not wrong....what you did was admirable.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> if you really like him, he is a nice guy and he wants you back , why not???
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> If he dont even see at another gals/women.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> LOL...ask her why she is like that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> let me know when you find out
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> Honey Honey Honey...Beauty Is Only Skin Deep!!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> This things makes a friendship stronger... NO QUESTIONS ASK...  Hope I was able to help you out...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> so, at the end of the day, there ain't no difference.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> He had a terrible life, his father beat him, blah blah blah.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Well I don't think I would be happy at first.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_60> when you go out look at the couples.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> SHE PROBABLY FIGURED THAT YOU ARE SCARED
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> By saying sincerely: ''baby,i am so sorry.how can i make it up to u?!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> At least now he'll wash up.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> You are still growing and the baby fat may go away and it may not.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> you should ask her what things she's into.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> can i be drunk without being drunk, i thinknot!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Hope you find the boy of your dreams!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> are you thinking hes not satisfied because you arent?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> Live life on your terms not somebody else's!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> You r in love with her because u feel she is good for you.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> I have never once used a pick up line...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> If they are just friend I would tell her how I feel.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Your just in love with him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Most guys do seem to like women with large breasts.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> it isn't good to be a lesbian?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> She left because I lied to her about stupid stuff.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> There is a person who can care u, just think & find.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> QUESTION .. WOULD U WANT TO BE MARRIED AND MISERABLE OR ALONE AND HAPPY OR CONTENT.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Maybe you need to hang out with  different women.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> But that doesn't mean that there is only one lid.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> Get some other idiot to rub all up against.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> but a tad of innocent flirting wouldnt hurt.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> iam meeting this guy for the first time sunday.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> I WISH HE WILL BE CONVINCE AND LOKE YOU AND FORGET ABOUT HIS LAST B****.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> talk to her and find out why she was trying to put you in that predicament.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> You can get a girl pregnant.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> well what makes you notice a guy???
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> who really knows......when you find out , lets hope he has a brother!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> if u ask this question something should tell u that u have love.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> Only the best of us have haters... =)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> i am a woman and i don't think that's possible, but try to get her attention.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Even if you love him you do deserve better.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> One time it got real bad.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> does any one know a frank or denise?
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_40> at least the shaft and sack.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> The girl back home- she sounds like the kind of person you don't want to lose touch with.
<NbChars_280> <LevSim_10> RUN TO HILLS REPEAT RUN TO HILLS
<NbChars_260> <LevSim_20> He gets his, you get urs.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> Don't worry because you can fix this.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> if you are not yourself then you will never fall in love truly.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> why dont u try asking do u like any body?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> How can i tell if he likes me or if he's playing games.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> ummm not really...it should end up with being old but happy together forever
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> depends on what area...life in general?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> and I think there are 2 or 3 others are there not, 'Shady ol' boy???
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> it's kind of just warm and fuzzy...on the inside.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> no, it would make you a more sexy looking 36,you go girl
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Cuz we don't understand ourselves ;)
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> aight so theres a lot of sexy niggas at my scool.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> do whatever she says.. love her ONLY..
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> ^^^^^ everything that they said ^^^^^ plus you need to correct your spellings... its cyber and not ciber
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> (just tell him to stop acying like that around you)
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_30> what it * * * means????????????????
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> straight up and down, no curves, nothing.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> My dad just got into it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> What if you were to catch a STD?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> no looks they dont matter that much.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> if he did not come up with a good awnser i would dump him!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> It hurt like hell... and then you are incredibly disappointed b/c it sucked
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> Okay ... since you two are more like random stranger rather then friends .
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> just because you're in love, doesn't mean you're going to get married or even be together.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> if u've ever been in love, you'll find out.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> at least let her hear your voice when you do it.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> Sometimes it's just easier for one girl to talk to another you know?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> ive learned i dont like women bigger than me.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> SOme things just wern't meant to be.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> make him want ur booty but dnt give him any cuz ur to big for him.lol
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> just want to put my arms around one and hold my nose to her neck.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> You're a young, married couple - it should be FUN!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> its if u deeply care about that person adn would change the world for a smile across there face.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> YES IT GET HARD... DAMM HARD BUT LIFE GOES ON.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> Many years later it is still great and it just keeps getting better.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Somethings you dont repair, you just keep !servicing!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> I don't really care for Angelina Jolie very much.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_10> BECAUSE THEY CAN'T SLEEP BEFORE HAVING SEX..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Dont let anything screw ur relationship if u really love ur partner.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Ok, doc martens are not hot, but boots on a woman are very sexy.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> THEY ARE ALL LIKE THAT , GET USE TO IT
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> My friend had this girl that tried to make it really obvious that she liked him.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> well i think this guy is afraid getting himself in a commitment!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Dont be caught up in the drama
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> realize that its either you or the next guy to get the desired girl..  this worked for me.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> r u looking for an asian girl?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_10> AND MADE YOU LOSE A BABY?!?!?!?!?!?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> Definitely not in english - you have serious problems with it!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> thats quite a problem good luck w/ that
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> folk get all mad if a guy is 90% of what they wanted or if her hair is 2short.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> From there you should be atble to tell if he right for you, or if he needs to go.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> it really depends on what you think it is.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Are you flirty with other guys?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> I have alot a guy friends.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> well you could email me =) <3    tayreane43@yahoo.com
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> the sad part is that a lot of people skip the 4th step.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_10> SEEMS KINDA STANGE THAT YOU WOULD SAY HIS NEW SECRETARY WAS CUTE!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> 2 kids later, I still got it and she doesnt.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> THATS THE BEST THING YOU CAN DO
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> you don't deserve that, you should dump him and really try to forget about him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> depends do you also only look for the guys that are in really good shape?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> No, it's normal...just don't go broadcasting it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> also be nice and respectful to her husband so he won't mind when you call.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> REMEMBER THE GOOD.. LET GO OF THE BAD AND MOVE ON.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> politely, with smile, and make them want to know more about u
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> If you are ready then you are ready to have sex!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> the lack of intrest or you werent turned on
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> but if you he loves you, just tell him thats 20 more pounds to love?....
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> yeah ur total gay u aint straight
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> For women sex not usually that big deal.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> watch football/baseball, go fishing/hunting, learn about cars, ect.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Oh yeah, I'm 31 and he's 47. :-|
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> sure u can...just choose the good one...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> just go up to her and just open your mouth and just talk.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> call her daily to say Hi.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> well actually its called infatuation its very much like love!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> Wow you sound like me...we should chat!!!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> So do looks REALLY matter in love?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> Twice the women why wouldn't a guy like that?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> r u stupid how are a load of strangers supposed 2 kno what kinda guys u date
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> but one thing that i personally do not like is being asked out over IM or text message.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> so n the long run all that really matters is do u want a #1,2,or3  type of relationship?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> I don't want anyone saying I ask for too much.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Women don't normally have a penis.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> While others pretend to love you, but do not.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> That's pretty tough but dont lose hope.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> just take a deep breath and ask!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> I myself have the same problem with gals.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> I don't have one yet, & i'm 13
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> why would you want to, unless you want to keep your options open.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> eyes, stomach, lips, butt and heels
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> women looking for men also if your looks hot then similare girl will show in your life...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> besuase you will never know if you like guys if you dont.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> you can not imagine your life without her/him< and suddenly you find her/him cheating you with someone else.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> The fact that he said that he 'cared for you' and that 'it wasn't working'.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> If cutting your penis doesn't help then cut your hands off
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> this guy is a sap and you will be too if you let him stick the blame on you!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> She's just looking for stuff to bitch about.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> webdate.com try there it is free
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> ....either that or you might be looking for a new beau!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> if he flirts a little too much
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> Some men are like that just like women.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> like if she flirts with you.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> get some counseling  You'll be ok.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Or a friend with a dad that may stare at u a little longer than normal?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> He thinks I should be more compromising...but I'm just not comfortable with doing it at all.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> So what if she doesnt like you anymore?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> IF YOU HAVE TO ASK; YOU HAVE YOUR ANSWER
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> No, its not a bad thing.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> well if you dont know then we can not tell you
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_45> If she is married, just be her friend.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> Big burger and fries for a meal?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I really don't know what to do!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> That would be like me asking, Why is it that no man can construct a sentence properly?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> I wouldn't shave it all off, no.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Crushes are ppl who you think are hot.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> im in a position like that.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> always try to be less talkitive and be mysterious in front of men......
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> no that's psycho and controlling, does he have sex at work?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Hopefully guys will answer this one!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Don't hold it against me though!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> i think thats great and i feel you should start over fresh
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> make him listen do whatever it take just nothing too drastic!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> all guyz look at is yo ass and yo titties, they dont care bout nothing else....
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> then one day ask her out on your first date it will be more clearer.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Just lay it out for him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Well it seems that your doing everything right so far.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> tell him......that she has a boyfriend!!
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_40> if he loves you, he will wait.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_35> I called my highschool boyfriend 26 yrs later.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> So why u r scared with her.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> Finally one day I saw him with another girl then I knew it wasnt me but him .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> During my teenage times my family used to say i always ask for too much.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> u did not mention ur mind size
<NbChars_290> <LevSim_20> be your self...put yourself out there
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_10> SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO JUST LET GO!!!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> U could be in love with the fact that u are indeed in love.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_30> i have officially slept with 5 guys and 0 women in my life nad im 26
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> its like hes scared ....and thats it cuz of what happened be4....him cheating on me.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> she means you remind her of her brother.So she means she doesn't wanna go out.!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> He even muttered GOT YOU when he saw me one day and looked down shyly.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> Yeah, one of my dads drinking buddies.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> if u love him, why did you break up with him in the first place?!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> but you have to be prepared for him to end it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> :) Good luck on your future.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> How can I show him im not becuase ive told him 1000 times im not!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I spent last weekend there and it was like staying with my sister.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> why would you like 3-some, when a  4-some is better, 3 girls and me, hahaha.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> dont think about what you are gonna say and all of that stuff.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> but don't write your name on it, let her guess.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> I love humanity ... does that count?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> ^^^^^ omg u r all sluts and pervs ^^^^^^
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Contact me through my web site for chat with a real British guy - I dare you :-)
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> look at it like this, most marriages dont last very long.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> You don't have to be 'friends'.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> is it true dat a person cud always find a person 4 him/her?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> if so do you call that a friend.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> not really as long as its conversational....and ur not being overly prying...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> I thought it was a fling.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Your looking at the wrong thing here and its dangerous to do so like this.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> he is a type of person that dont say  i love you  alot.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> if it was a nice guys;the face
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> OMG she could get in trouble for that i would just move on.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> They were friends before me and my husband even met.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> (he only does them were alone)so im in the same position u are.plus im 16.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> It always happens at about the 2.5 year mark and I really don't want that to happen with him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Don't try to get a guy who is already taken!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> A guy telling you you're not interesting, look the other way and run like hell honey!!!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> And if he say's that B.S.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Why do men think it is o.k to be friends after they have f---up?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> In that case, DROP THEM BOTH!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> attitude is sexier, but money is tasty =)
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> of cors u can be friends with any guy u want to be friends with  Ü
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> so dont worry, as the saying goes, times heals all wounds, we get our own chances for forgiveness.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> My mom, dad, grandma, and grandpa dying.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> take a seperation time and then get back together
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> r u smart?r u pretty looking??
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> 8/10 guys and 7/10 girls will not date someone who smokes!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> In your case, I'd castrate the SOB...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> It doesn't really matter where you are, there are good looking people everywhere.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> thats when i know im in love.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> maybe if your G/f or Friend is a Transvestite they do but yea, no penis on women!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Well, tell her that you like her like that and see where it goes.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> or annulment here in the philippines?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> she needs you too even if shes married.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> just walk up to him and start a conversation.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> I love quikies, she used too, but I dont get um anymore.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> that the way it is sorry ka na lang....
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> my daughter, I adore her and love her so much.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> so it is special when he says it.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> it is possible but my advice pick the 1 who luvs u back
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> Act like it's no big deal.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> it actually depends on person to person.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> i'll be back with more advices soon, i hope.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> I don't think it is weird.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> you cant go out hunting for love.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> talk to her, but you have to be yourself.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> My fiance has a little extra around the middle and I think it is sexy as hell.!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> get to the root problem and quit beating around the bush.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> boys only do that, I THINK.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> So your best bet would be to move on with your life with out him...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> you can't mess with free will.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> They obviously aren't that great if they are cheating on you and not worth staying with.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Everyone gets horny no matter what age.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Do it because you are a GOOD person.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> He was such a dork then.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> It could be a big ego-booster!)
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> Well, think of it like this: sometimes, maybe he just wants to hang out with his friends.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> I found my soon to be wife thru match.com.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> u answered my question on y!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> You should get a new friend or have it out with her tell her she's being a supper b.i.t.c.h!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> but  most of bf tends to  move ur head up and down, so its indirectly causes  headache
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> My first time, was with my pal when I was 15... blank stares.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> you can ask his friends if he does and go from there
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> If you really hate it, just tell him so.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> have him see another girl and see which one he picks
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Are you ready to have kids???
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> then he won't take you serious.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> theres never too much until you have a kid
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> y ?r u taking a census?well i am single.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> WE MEN ARE NOT PERFECT,  WHO EVER THINKS THEY ARE, ARE FOOLING THEM SELVES.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> It's too easy to get a divorce...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> You got one Dad.... Boyfriends are like buses and come along every few minutes.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> If that's not it...then never mind ;-)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> SPEAK WRITE AND TALK INTELLEGENTLY SO YOU CAN JOIN THIER LEGUE.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> you can't stop anyone from flirting.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> please someone giv me some advise.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I want to taste your *u*
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> well, they only met with each other two days then fall in love with each other...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> When she talks, it is nice to listen to.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Uhh...no...thats wrong...and all kinds of laws against it...umm...but I like thefriends with benefits style.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> I find him attractive but for some reason I think he is way too blonde.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> :) Just give it some time and things will be back to normal...trust me.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> If you got it, would you share???
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> One minute shes all over me and the next she as cold as ice
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> When he stares at your breast alot.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> (Or girls who really know their guy.)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> exactly there isnt one certain way.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i have a bunch of them.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> cuz it aint sumthin u play with, it aint a game.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> a true friend doesn't go out with there friends ex's and they do not steal them ether!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> AND I DONT MEAN TO BE RACIST EITHER.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> The worst they could say is, I can't or no.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> fill in the blank a movie,get an ice cream cone ect.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> leave him and go out and find the love of your life
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> They tell all.. And chest too..
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Someone has to break the ice....!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> guy's if you didn't like your girlfriend would you spend 9 months with her?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> shes chinese and black and has long hair and takes good pictures.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> ya itll never turn around with that attitude... the key is being optimistic.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Needless to say she got what I was trying to tell her.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> his a loser, find a real man, perhaps me santodomingo@yahoo.com
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> maybe at the age of 15...idk..hasn't happened 4 me yet.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> ho said that guys dont say sorry its just that ur with one that doesnt bad luck
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> didnt ask this question before ?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> yes if the sex was realyyyyyyyyyyyy that good
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> I love my ex, but she dumped me :(( How do I get her back??
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> u havent been looking n the right places
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Anyone that doesn't see a great person behind something as trivial as braces probably isn't worth it.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> i love tulips but every ones diffrent
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_20> he is broken ha ha hahhhh
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> However, I do not believe life will ever get to taht point.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> they just don't c how good she is....eventually she will have a gorgeous smile....
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_25> And you asking what a D I C K look like?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> Insert random xxx act here, great food, back & feet rubs, affection, ...
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> Smile Girl and Keep Your Head Up :)!!!!
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_25> most people equate seman as nasty.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> but also if you have problems on your own solving it try getting some counseling.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> Just find some girl you like build a foundation and ask her out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> and they know it in and out.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> Tell him that you knew it was ending.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> well that might be dangerous for you though...it depends what kind of divorce it is.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> well I think jasons an idiot
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> get professional help especially if you are the father because you know that it isnt right
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> I'm a guy and I don't stay friends with my exes.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> Cool chill its not the end of the world...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> no your right if can f--- and not fight i'm all for it
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Hey it happened in Parent Trap,so why not!?!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> i dont know i would have to wait and see when it comes up
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> that is a sign of love, wanting that other person to be happy... no matter what,
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> no its not wrong---if he dont like her.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> Think if she deserves you, and if you deserve her too!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> YOu don't have to ask him if you can though.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> they do not have any manner
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Yep, i have been friends with this guy for about 5 years now.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> i know how it feels it hurts bad real bad ani do want to die
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> will you know the guy an will it be a 1shot deal meaning you never see him again?
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_50> ask her what time it is.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_45> If the girl is annoyed, it probably means she's not interested anymore.
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_35> Sex is just and only sex.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> IF U HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS OR STATEMENTS EMAIL ME I WILL GET RIGHT BACK TO U.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_15> I HAVE SLEEPT WITH QUITE A FEW WOMANS,BUT I CHOSE QUALITY  OVER QUANTITY.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> And yes you can still care and respect her if you let her lead the way.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> because that makes a big difference.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ... Run away with me and make your life a misery .... HEHEHE..LOL   Jus' Kiddin'ya Sweets...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> she is also angry at me as i flirt around with other girls a lot in my school.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> yea i'm all those you just mentioned and like mart guys.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> Lonely Road By Kid Rock... Great Tune for a wedding.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> To be honest most women like them pick up lines we say we dont but we do.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> sound like he wants sex, if you dont love him dont give it to him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> And since he cheated then thats all they are.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> i'm one hehehe... well are there any true honest men in this world?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Are you sure you are Just a Friend?....Doesn't sound right.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> If so, How about a CD Burner?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i never knew u had friends and u shouldnt mess with me cus my uncles the president hahahaha bitch
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> YOU HAVE THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IN FRONT OF YOU DON'T SCREW IT.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> you should lose weight and get really hot the dump him like the dog he is.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> some women have longish breasts without volume, that's yuck.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> There are lots of people who just needs that special something there so much, they create it for themselves.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> try to talk to him alot and be nice
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> I believe you can ... its just happens ... but might not realise it but it certainly does!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> and that no matter what discusting thing u do thell always love u back.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Make a CD of Love songs from you to her.....
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> Oh, boy, do I know where you're coming from!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> keep trying only if youve stopped being a lying little shit.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> it depends on if you are just friends at the momment.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> no not at all picky, i do all that stuff to my girlfriend already, kinda out of habit
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> now she is not talking to me.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> I think its stupid the 'good' thing to do in society now is to always stay friends...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Think about the family member that told you it won't last.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> You can't find them 'cause your asking to manny stupid ?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> Everytime i dont talk to my girlfriend she asks me if i'm mad at her.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> just set him down and have a heart to heart.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_40> If you really like her, just ask her out.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> just tell him u need more time!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> well why did you 2 break up in the first place could it happen again easily?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> ITS JUST WHAT I SEE IN MY NEIGHBORGHOOD!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> trust the old biddy on this one.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Try going on a vacation together just the two of you....Shake it up..Do something crazy together...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> just tell them about each other and u decide which one is the best one 4 u
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Usually it means 'I don't want to'
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Again, DO NOT PUT UP WITH THIS.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Because you are a little shy you will and have to get over that later own in life.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> you dont need to show it.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> Don't just come right out and ask if she'll be your girlfriend though.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> hope i helped u a widdle bit =]
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> I'm like 40 pounds over weight & I have my ups & downs, but over-all I've been pretty happy.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> i would work harder on myself so can get what i want easier.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> dont do it.......... u will regret it
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> Smells fishy don't do it or you will regret it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> when you see that special some body and you eart doe flip flops, thats when u know
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> besides basic training isn't that long.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> You are a great loss to your ex gf!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> And they loved my American accent!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> we even lost a baby wich i was very happy .
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> pick who is best for you
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> men are just looking for a place to have sex,and wemon need a reason to have sex!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> I can't say that I have.........and I wouldnt because of diseases out there.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> Treat her like she isn't hot.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> so, if you want to sleep with a married man that is your choice.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Stop dreaming abt pamela Anderson 5.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> be honest, be brave, give it to them straight face to face...and move on.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> I'm not one of those chicks who'd fight for their man...I dont wanna go as low as that!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> the way he speaks ,voice, attidue ,the way he walks ,plus a nice innocent smile.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> itz ok if ur careful and smart about it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> they love that person and think they can spend the rest of their life with that person.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> i have a good man for 3 years.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> so that is how i know.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_40> no that is unless she is despprate but hopefully you dont like desprate girls
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> by letting her be her self and giving her room an space
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_10> DO BETTER GIVE YOUR CREDIT CARD DETAILS ALSO LOL
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Tell him he can get some after you get yours.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> no i wouldn't that would be wastin my time.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> if they swear only occasionally and when the cause is just, i dont care.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Dress nice, clean yourself up a bit.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> I know its pissess him off.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Contrary to what movies say, don't try to be her friend at first.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> If he says no them just say ok i am going if you still want to go call me!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> BUT...when my sister-in-laws husband's dad died they were all up in it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Sparms are sneaky little guys, maybe he is hiding...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Give it time and u won't feel the same way about him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> You know your man, follow your heart!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I want it and she doesnt.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> Most men say they dont like something in a woman.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> ok,if any of us had it and he had given it to us,why would we give it to you?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> did he have 6 kids w/ 1 chick or numerous?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> If it works or not is based on how much you both want it too.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> maybe tell him he's too small?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> oh yea how cute is he and y do u want 2 get rid of him
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> SORRY TO SAY, BUT YOU SHOULD HAD KNOWN ALL ABOUT YOUR BOY BEFORE YOU COMMITTED YOURSELF TO HIM.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Yeah   one of my brothers friend died hid hair wayyyyyyyyy to blond!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> there is no color to the sky
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> He needs to speak about what if she does leave?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> tell him to stop trying and to just get out of their hair.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> I don't know!...I just want the points...lol
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> If you can't find a person sexually attractive unless they are good looking then they would matter to you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> but like the first guy said, you have to learn to like yourself first.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> go up to him and get naked and kiss
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_30> be a man and go and talk to her, or you'll neva get her
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> everything different....but then again perfect isnt so great either ...not too much fun
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_45> believe it or not there are!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> I don't know, but I sure know who the love of my life is!!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> If he wants you to go he'll ask you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> and now some of my friends are saying i am to old.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> is that still the best bet when looking for flowers.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> And I am married to him!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> How old does he look to you?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> was that you or him who wanted to break up?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> he stood you up at the prom?!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> If you'r bestfriend likes you and asks you out you should atcept!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> what kinda site are we talkin about
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> B4 Anyone Else Can Beleive In You!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Not 200lbs, because I'm already big as it is.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Kissing just leads to other stuff.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> well if you now him start talking to him as a friend and maybe he'll start lyking you

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Oh how those messages set her heart afire!

<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> So go ahead and bang him.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Don't try telling her where she's wrong.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> that is very inhumane quit that relationship
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Hey friend...  Do you really like this girl?

<NbChars_175> <LevSim_55> b yourself if he is the one he will be happy
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Be busy loving yourself and the right person will run over you in a big red truck- mine did!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> Even though fluteboy is really annoying.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> maybe if ya gave more details or something but good luck
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> or u can find another friend of his, and see if they know anything.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> she will also be there for you.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> There are soo many diseases out there these days and you don't wanna get them.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> You are special just the way you are!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> 3) Neither of you is a Mind reader.

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> 1) if there is a problem we talk first!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> A lot of girls your age think they are fat but really are not.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> So why even go for it just because of his looks!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> its her way of telling you she don't love you anymore.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> try the college where he went, most the time u can recah them that way.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Sex is a VERY intimate thing and should be shared w/ the one you love and will marry.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Both say they love me so much.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> One of my friends likes a guy that is cute to her but he is just gross to me.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> ive known her for 5 years.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> plus, we kick our underwear up in the air to see if we can catch them, ???
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Also their butts........hey at least I am honest, I love a good butt!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> you just know... you'll feel so great about everything in your life.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> very much so....the #1 thing I look for a guys is future.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> study, and not get into fights with my sister
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> yeah but I think its really hard
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> I would , wait I have .
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> If that doesn't work, his useless...DUMP HIM.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Someone who wants to be their friend and not just their lover!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> 9 out of 10, he thinks your hot!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_50> how do u think i should dress.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> That guy will never respect you again if you drag it too long.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> how r u devoted to love yet u cheat?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> you cant make it grow.... That's a turn off!!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> I would not be with a fat girl.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Just watch When Harry Met Sally!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> maybe you need to find a new man?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> there is no way you can do that without hurting her or him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> If he is just a friend, then why does it matter if you go with another guy?
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> just go on my dear,dont be afraid,all fair in love...your in love so come what may......
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_40> Ask him if shucks is a good thing.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> like wat do you do or like you know
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> i dont know.. i have the same problem.. though hes not my best friend, just a friend.. but still..
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if we can't then it's time to break it off.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> I HAD SAME PROBLEM...A GREAT WEBSITE HELPED ME THROUGH MY MARRIAGE PROBLEMS.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> i mean shes not all that ugly.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Accept him if you too like him in that way.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> Having bigger breasts might be cool for the boys but what if you don't like it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> yes you can and 10:00pm but 11:00pm on the weekends
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> even if u love him, hes not worth it
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> he's just a guy--smoeone who supposedly evolved from apes!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> I am single but some people said they thought I am married.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> because they're in love and they don't want 2 spend the rest of their life alone!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> This guy must be some kind of freak.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> he is great to me and why kids, and i love him.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_25> fat  so she stays with you
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_20> Just have to add my NO also
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> HELL YEAH whats your F***ing problem
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> O-K THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> i have lots of guy friends and they want me to go and **** them.should i or not
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> and now he likes me...should i go back out w/ him?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> because maybe u have changed for the better?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> My family says that if he really cared about me then he would be with me.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> he has gone to counseling, but she refuses to.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_30> Why would you settle for a man who hits you?!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> If she try to control you... this it's not the godly way I'm affraid...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> And make sure u tell him that you like him and care for him and what he thinks.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> just tell her how you feel.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> your parents dont have to like your bf, you do.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> well as far as myself im not attracted to a female that weighs more than me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> she wants you to be friends and not more!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> trust me, take it easy on him.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> the bible says the tongue is uncontrollable
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> You might want to start by showing some friggin respect and NOT posting her full name on the internet!!
<NbChars_245> <LevSim_20> If ur asking, ur probably gay.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Well, if one is just visting, then you don't see him very often.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> make it short but do keep in contact with her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> it just means you have moved on to accept that she is with another guy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> tell him that you like his game and just admire his game play .
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> i say with friends like that who needs enemies.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> (i prefer the liquid with royal jelly)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> I really like them both but i really don't know what to do.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> maybe he feels there is something special with this girl plus do you really want her left overs?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> TIME IS THE BEST ANSWER FOR EVERYTHING...
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> You are crazy that is nothing but shawdows noten but shawdos
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> If she doesn't believe he doesn't like her then ask him together.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> she will do anything for him.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> If you put this person first.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> It really shouldn't matter what a girl looks like, it's whats inside that really counts !!
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_30> I had the best time EVER.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_15> I WANT THE EXACT SAME KIND OF GUY!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> Drop her as a friend, not cool at all.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> I said OK - that's cool.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Of course I was flattered and happy!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> We don't care about a few extra pounds especially in the butt.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> i like about a 36 C but they have to be real.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> I, for one, am not infatuated with gay guys.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Isn't that what webcams are for?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> Wouldn't both of you own it?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> i hardly everrr see him in school either usually i see hima t my brothers basketball games .
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> I luv to sing and have a free personality!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Why do you like thick chix and whats the difference if any being with one physically?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> I would said my boyfriend how much I love him and I would save my sister....
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> aren't being honest with themselves - or you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> you are in 6th grade dont worry about it to much.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> honey u said it, they,re men!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> call the college, or if u can, go there.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> his arms if there strong u know his not a lazy a guy
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_25> Keep your eyes open for wierd Sh_t!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> We don't always think about sex.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> (plus there is financial benefits to it)
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> then tell him that the relationship might not last long.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> Come on, he was your BEST FRIEND!!!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> looks and then the personality matters
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> I swear Im a sex addict and she isnt.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> HEY I USED THAT LINE WHEN I WANTED TO DITCH THE GUY!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> yeah it's ok to have a guy as a friend.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> Some white girls dont date black guys, some do.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> yeah if you do it that way
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> you should be shopping or hanging out with your friends, not having sex with them.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> let him you are not .why u think that
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Mom and Dad just seems to personal to me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> AND TRY NOT TO BE SHY AND DONT FREAK OUT IF HE TURNS YOU DOWN!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> But hearing a person swear all the time is not cool.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> I'm so sorry I hurt you...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> :-)  Seriously, learn to like yourself first.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i like my girl tobe girly but not shy so i can talk with her
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> But it is very important no matter what cruise line you choose to tell them you are celebrating.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> You definately don't have to please his every whim to have a happy married life!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> nice face he, can lose weight right?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> it is not that men like more sex then women.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> he thinks i need to lose 20 pounds for us to have a happy married life
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> #3 when u fall n love u love the idea of just being around.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> he dont want to get hurt what should i do to get him to trust me
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> well not all boys are that way.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> And we go back to the golden rule Treat others like you wanna be treated.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> Like, give hints here and there.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> totaly boxers tighty whites are so groose
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> hI MY NAME IS CAYLA $i'm 10,11
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> was your bestfriend pregnant when you started dating this guy.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> drink a lot of red bull watch porn
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> No-one wants to be the bad guy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> But  just dont know  what to do?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> So I will get the money & run back to him ....
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Don't hang on to a relationship if you know it's not gonna work out.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> Well this is me but, I would rather you ask me what I want.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> i have a girl friend that i've spent every second with that i can since i've been back.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> (i mean his personality, not whats underneath his pants) lol
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> personaly i go by there personality.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Sorry Sweetie, but no woman (or man for that matter) is perfect.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> ask what are some of her fantansies.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> If he really loved you, why would your weight matter?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> I really didnt get this part YEAH R nay?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> one day she'll remove that...sooo...if you really like her...go for ....
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> i could be that or maybe he dont know what he wants as yet
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> you already made your decision....it's over.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> I bet she's gay happy too.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> go for her screw the friend
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I tell him no one is ever ready.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> So far, so good (he's not psycho!)...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> you lie you dont have no bones in it
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> 3 is avoiding the thought of anything, and just not caring.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> But there's no way to take it back.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> i think the 2nd answer is realy best you tell him what your heart think about him
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> Not hate ... Just afraid !!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> when i get mad i say such awful things.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> TEN (on a scale of 1 to 10 of course)hope this helps
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> You wouldn't like it if it was the other way around, right?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> THERE WILL ALWAYS BE SOMEONE ELSE BETTER LATER IN LIFE!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> But, whatever you do, don't let her get away.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> Because once its done its done.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> twice the nudeness, fun, enjoyment, and sex.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> I'm not married, but I dont think i would call my MIL mom just because she isnt my mom.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> you love your girlfriend/ boyfriend so much.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> rain boots, gutter boots, hooker boots, steal toed boots & snow boots.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> support him on what ever he wants to do with his life
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> IF A MAN MAKES A INNOCENT OR STUPID MISTAKE,  WHY  DO  THEY BECOME   DAMADGE GOODS.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> anytime you can get a cute girl go for it
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> I like them to take total control in the bedroom
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> but, I still want lovin, day and night.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> I am scared of it, love it, and hate it all in one psycho mess of emotions =^)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> I don't like asking anybody for anything just for that reason.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> A man wants what interests him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> dont think of the consequence .
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> but if they seem like a total mismatch, tell him not to worry, it will soon pass.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> That's like asking why do women hang around their girlfriends.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> well, if you'd apologize for the nth time already, don't you think that's enough proof that you're sincere.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> They're full of sluts over there!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> Depends...are you a guy or a girl?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> really terrible like i would want to die.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> Your lucky, youve got something a lot of girls are really looking for, keep him !
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> dont think your in love, unless its with me, hit me up via messenger let chat santodomingo@yahoo.com
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Court her again.. send her flowers!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> if you're not funny then i suggest you deploy plastic surgery
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Most importantly, don't say them again.....ever
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> well that just means that you are really close in her eyes but don't fuk it up
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> And want to hear 4rom U!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> (smile) oh.. and congratulations to you both.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Then you can talk a lot.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> (pause for some seconds) -a stupid question about something you both like.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> she is not in my school also
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I didn't read your other question but talking is a good thing.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> I just ain't gonna be in a relationship with one.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> but then of course you have golddiggers :-p
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_20> i dont REALLY KNOW OH CRAP MY COMPUTER JUST WENT INTO CAPSLock oh, thats better.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> I NEVER STAY FRIENDS WITH MY EX!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> someone who cant type to save his life.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> they don't feed it excess fuel or pour gas on it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Unless they are witch-pointed toe low rise boots, I say it's very sexy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I think she would like flowers, dinner, and chocolate!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> When the boys belly up to the booby bar I always say a-cups for me please
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> you're toooooooooooooooooooo young.What if you became a dad ?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Do I accept them back & take someone else.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> A good love maker pays attention to what you like...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> I hate it when people cuss.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> well, at least be friends with the guy.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> have you ever gave him a reason not to trust you?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Just punch her in the eye
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> maybe because panties cover two cheeks!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> I personally don't think that ALL black men behave that way!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> If she dumped you it's not worth it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> He loves me when I do bad and when I do good.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> I know it would me for sure!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> afterall, you guys are best of friends.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> ANYONE CAN LOOK AT A PERSON AND TELL IF THEY LOVE THEIR SIGNIFICANT OTHER
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> i want to know if he really going to change
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> Find another girl, they are a dime a dozen these days!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> ok depends do u know the guy??
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> It's only wrong to do it...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> or he will find someone to fill his.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> IT'S LIKE I HAVE A BRICK WALL IN FRONT OF MY HEART.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> roses ,you can't go wrong with roses
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> they look at camels all day, that makes em horny
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> if not, then maybe he is just insecure about himself.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> one thing i know is that if this guy really loves you, he is going to forgive you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> His visits to bars are FUN, drinking is FUN< all the loveyou can give him is still not FUN!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> you are his best friend you must know a lot about get together and do something you both like
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> and the more i learn out about men, the more i like dogs!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> Just think of what your doing and not about you
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> you should take into consideration how many babies mommas are out there.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> The women in my family tend to do that)
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> EDIT: Petfauna - my middle name is exxxperiment!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> it sounds like your husband is really a trustworthy guy since you guys talked about this.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Well, first you get real close to a person you like.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> always asking question u discribe ur mental level .
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> I like my men to be sexy and funny and not a sex addict
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> (They only want one thing) Am I too picky?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> That sounds a lot like ME.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Or am I just rushing things.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> why does he run back to her when he likes me also?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> ), before making a big move like this (leaving job, family, etc.)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> IT REALLY DEPENDS ON THA GUY.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> guys like girl with character.. i prefer girl who have their own character and not mimic some idol star...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> if you snapped this time whos to say you wont snap again?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> i find it really childish but the problem is i really really love him soo much.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> so they go out for a while.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> I'M MARRIED TO AND ME AND MY WIFE DOES IT 4 TIMES A WEEK, AND WE HAVE A CHILD.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> yeah, it can happen, trust me!

<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> ANd then he thinks i am faking it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> But you're young, and you might do foolish things.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> im sorry because it sounds like you've had a rough time!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> No I have to have a girl lighter than me
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> do you flirt with people you don't like?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> She does mind about the age difference or maybe the parent does.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> He could be cheating and think you would do likewise??
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> It seems men are pretty much ready anytime.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> It's not about cocks, and ass, and tits and butthole pleasures.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> What really angers me is that my dad remained friends with the guy!
<NbChars_255> <LevSim_30> oral and  anal sex do that
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> the same reason man want to in up in own panties
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> When your in a relatonship there HAS TO BE TRUST.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> and you want us to tell you is ok to have sex with him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> no, wait till your 18 at least, then persue the relationship.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> cos then may be he is not the right man for you.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> Just give him anything you like *by your heart*!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> I would like a good list of wedding SONGS.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> share your lust with everybody u meet !
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Figure it out and then go to a website with those kinds of products.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> it really dnt matter to me it is the person not the looks
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> School life 15 n 15 years old
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> read a book or 2 on relationships.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> 4 is even though it's not easy forgiveness and closure.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> Why do you always do such stupid things?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> the only hard thing is findin your one.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> if u truely love him then hes all urs
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Girls love to be told they are pretty by a complete stranger, it gives them a confidence boost!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> you need a man who can satsify you
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Go up to him and tell hi how u feel.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> this depends on the type of guy you want to attract.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> After 6 years, She became very irritated person, especially when her sister got married to money barrel guy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> BTW> Went through a similar situation and got other piercings ... (THE GIRLS ;)  lol)
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> change your phone number and DONT give him any more info...thats creepy
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Me, I'm a virgin and will be until I marry that girl.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> and by the way just tell him whats the worst that could happen.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Have him not try so hard.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> so, end it with a BANG!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> THEY LIE AND THEY ONLY WANT ONE THING AND I KNOW THAT U KNOW WHAT IT IS!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> TALK TO AN OLDER RELATIVE BROTHER, SISTER, AUNT, UNCLE SOMEONE.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> (if you guys have kids, could you call her what they do?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> I must love myself and not let anyone else shake that!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> have you ever seen little green sparkles in his eyes at night?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Depend on which one puts you in more trouble
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> tell them how beautiful they r :)
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> i dont know why she cant get a bf.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> One of my good friends once dated an alien.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> i hope u find ur special someone!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> bigger is better, as long as they are real.....no such thing as too big!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> but only if your willing to work on it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> So putting things such as don't want a relationship will some how make them more appealling.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> So smile you guys are GREAT just don't believe most of what we say.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> I do flirt with this girl because shes hot but its boring for me to talk to her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Get it on with her friends.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> But if you really love her, keep trying.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> 12...are you average, over, or under?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> because you won't be all nervous or upset about it before it even began!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> has he cheated on you why dont you trust him?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> if u r in love then u cant think about anything else, apart from that lucky man
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Then you need a new man!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Don't have sex cause you see all this stuff on TV with half naked women.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Now u know how most men feel.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> then make him wait awhile before you give him another dose of that
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> I think it's the other way around....
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> I want to be one of those old couples still ass grabbin.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Because i have that same problem.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> From those of us who know better... DO NOT DO IT!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> be honest do you like her to sit there and say nothing at all.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> do not make a big deal out of it
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_10> IF YOU LOVE SOMEONE CAN YOU CHEAT AND STILL LOVE THE PERSON YOUR WITH?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> i had mine at 13, although it was just a hush hush relationship.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> Maybe he feels he won't be a good dad?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> Yeah, just like Tommy probably told Pam that no one would see the tape either, hahahaha
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_20> Of course it not wrong  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> If you like him and have an attraction then don't throw in the towel just yet.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> for example; you dont like flies, right?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Just enjoy the fact that you have a guy that everybody wants to flirt with
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> 0 - it is not a question.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> i know i am to old to fall for dares but i did.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> I personally do not think it is bad I enjoy it too much .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> good and  and it will be better if your parntener enjoys it too
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> actually the way they smell in the morning.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> i want to marry this guy and move in with him.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> wait a while tell him again if he doesn't say i love you back break up wit him
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> has too much time gone by?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> go to a t-shirt printing shop and have a t-shirt made that just says single.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR NEW RELATIONSHIP!!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> Plus her dad will kill you!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> It's like saying that all men are the same, and I know for a fact that they aren't.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> Believe me... i know this works!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> One of my best friends and oldest friend is a guy.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> If he can't trust you then he isn't worth it, No offense.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> if she flirts or hits you alot
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> u feel safe n knowing that theyll b there always.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> Oh, ant the ass of course, but I look at it after I've checked the eyes.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> THERE ARE MANy FISH IN THE SEA...  take your time and go fishing..... sweetbabyray2002
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> something just ain't right about that whole thing to me.

<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> they always fight but then when they break up he runs back to her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> i'd introduce him to other girls.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> I need tips on this I dream abot this guy 4 time when i go to sleep Help ME!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> get over it theres nothing more a guy hates than a clingy stalker
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> Do NOTHING....sure that would surprise her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Love is all you need...at the end!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> I guess it's hard to pinpoint the real reason, huh?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> You're like the crazy guy in Murder She Wrote.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> if she doesnt want u dont have to worry u just pray to god for her good things .
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> do it 100 times to get best result.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> ignor his feelings and dedicate your self to your boy friend, you no bit**.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> The way they walk  The way they love
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> and we should treat our loved ones the same way.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> none i prefer them in a good shape and nice looking guy¡¡¡¡¡¡¡
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Um...okay, I HATE online relationships, just to let you know.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> If he's still cool tell him in 10th grade.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Oh i did i mention Money
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> but is thats only because Im not getting as much as I want?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> annulment now is quite easy in phil 3-5 years siguro
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> just be who you are, as long as you promote love, not sex or hatred!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Im not going to make it sound like she is a mean gf.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> let her feel that you love her and you shair your life with her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> my mom, friends , my boyfriend and his kids and a bottle of kessler or 2 or3!!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> AH AH .JUST LIKE GETTING MY FREAK ON .THAT HOT
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> imagine a girl you love who is xx years old.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> Maybe do some of her laundry.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Sometimes girls don't like to unload stuff on guys.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> DON'T EVER CHANGE YOURSELF FOR ANY MAN.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> Most popular guy in grade 6, huh?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> No, I call my mother-in law by her first name at times,but mostly a f'n btch
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> If thats what will make you happy go 4 it!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> she always says, she forgives but never forgets.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> At last , cut ur hands or penis
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> (in time, you probably will become friends again)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> I met a Frank on hotornot...wonder if it's him...lol  Hope Denise isn't his wife!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_10> THINK ABOUT ALL THE STD'S AND WHAT IF YOU GET PREGNANT.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> EITHER YOU TRUST HIM OR YOU DONT.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> I do call my father-in-law Dad.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> be thier friend first worry abought the rest later
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> Who do want more ur friend or a boy?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> Try waiting until you are in love with someone.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> wait for him to ask u to move in with him
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Like maybe cheating on you was a mistake and she knows she was wrong.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> wouldnt we all like to know that
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> if i was a dude i wouldn't.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Don't mess things up with this great guy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> After school kick it with your visiting friend.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> there is this guy i really like!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you are thinking about having sex with your bf.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> Heck, I still remember my first crush... my third-grade teacher!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> All I know is I'm driving myself crazy thinking about him and how much I miss him?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> my family, friends, and a naked rose mcgowan.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> hmmm, thats not always true !
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> They can't be that old so it shouldn't be hard.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Sounds fun but not enough to die from!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> PRAY YOUR HARDEST AND WALK AWAY.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> probably half of what you had when youre 22.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> but you have to keep up the maintenance or it'll itch like hell
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> can please explain more so we can help?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Most of my friends have way different tastes in guys.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I am that same kind of guy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Then a few years later, I had an orgasm & understood!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> but anyway, men can be sexy in anyway.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> well u write in letter email go to visit or call every day
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> i am not much of a swinger.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Like the word slacks....wonder if a guy can wear a just a slack?
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_50> 5 i got my first boyfriend.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> if god made anything better he kept it?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> there are always good men out there, it's just finding them.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> i told a friend that i liked her but she did not feel the same.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> in my experience, its ten times more sexy, especially for women to shave.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> my boyfriend cooks for me all the time.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> dump her and go on with your life.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> so, don't worry bout the mood swings its ok.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> As for the thirteen year old baby that you are in love with FORGET IT!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> No one likes ex's being around.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> if you ignore it something is gonna give.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> But, i'm a also a total butt man.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> sometimes it works but the ends matters alot
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> If you know she's a great person don't care about what anyone else thinks, be a true friend.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> that of a woman is probably far more dangerous
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> you lied to her man.. she's probably gone for good
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> It is a matter of age...they guys you know are in there sexual peak years...apparently you are a teen-20something.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Looks like the both of you have been married for the last 5 years.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> I just want my wife to want it as bad as I do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you may not be mr perfect but you expect perfect woman?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> sounds like youre cheating on her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> But before that I had alot of dates and fun before I found her.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> dont know .. i like2 girls kissing and eating lips of each other .. it turns me on
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> no, you can lust in a week though
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_10> MAYBE YOU LIKES FLIRTING WITH AND IF SHE CONTINUES, TRY HER.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_30> And dont ask yes or no questions.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> FROM MY EXPIREANCE HE LIKES U ALOT
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> :) sex has no step, buddy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Oh yeah, and the final reason...God said so!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> Just be careful with that one, ok baby?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> I've already liked guys like that... never the opposite...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> and that is ur actual MOM.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> or did that come after you was married.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> trust me he'll/she'll definately remember that!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> So i got into bodybuilding and started eating more.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> I loved him and he loved me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> my almost 13 year old spends alot of time at neopets.com
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> we both made eachother mad and last night we talked about it and resolved pretty much everything.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> GET AN EDUCATION BEFORE YOU WORRY ABOUT ANY ******.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> HA HA HA..WHAT A QUESTION..BUT WE SHOULD THINK..Y
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_35> So he'll be dumping her soon.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Men don't picture romance like we do.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> There are a lot of nice guys out there.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> show him that you are the dream girl for him!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> If its a teenager he would think oh man im so going to nail that.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> I don't think it's a bad thing to want to move on.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> It depends where she got married.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> please do not try to impress a guy.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> all women are just interested in sex.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> shes my bestfriend so help me out
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> and how old were you when you got your first kiss.give details
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> But to see nice eyes & a good looking smile also makes them much more attractive!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> the eyes are a lot of it for me, too.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> go to white pages.com.......they can look up anything......or you could call 411!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> I'm not always horny and I'm a cool guy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> listen to her, and then respond intelligently...  beware...it is difficult
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> you use like messenger to have sex over the net
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Get over him... he's not WORTH YOUR TIME.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> Those are oreos and it's DOUBLE STUFF.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> (haha)  You guys ALWAYS understand us!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> I don't think MOST women cry, but some do.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> Don't end up a statistic because you got pregnant or ended up with some S.T.D.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> #1 when u 1st meet some1 ur not attracted 2 their intelect.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> They never get close to me, and I never want to go see what it is.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> and a great find for a future wife!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> He said, I can't believe I wasted so much time on other girls...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> I mean I cant imagine someone that big ramming into me!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> And i never told any one.....
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> She said When I want to have sex, I'll let you know.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Just remember one thing, love conquers all.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> nothing is ever definite in a relationship, but if u feel that special something, then its worth investigating, right?
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> to you- green to us- blue
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> assorted, with lots of bright colors
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> Don't take a chance on your life like that.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> he dribbles... he shoots... he scores... 2 points...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Again don't look for one, and the right girl will come.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> no offence or anything ... it's ur friend thats crappy ... ur just u  ur the good friend
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Im only 19 and shes 24, we hang out often when im with her lil' brother.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> I can't wait until school starts back up.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> That was the #1 thing I remember.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> Is it a mature guy, he would think its cool and proud of you.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_55> I know i love her, Any advice?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Don't be hard on yourself, there's lots of time to get serious later
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> We chatted for a bit and I left.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> because you doing sex with mans
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> its either their looks,social standing,money,stuff like that.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Every one is so busy with their own lives, they don't sit around and gossip etc.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> sex sex sex and ice cream
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> and at home with their wives i guess....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> i thank you for that even thought i really deserve it
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> You've got to COMMUNICATE & TRUST one another & not back out when the tough gets going.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> and wen u wake up in the morning to please that person.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Becoming a parent is a HUGE step - I should know...I already am a mom.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Do you honestly think guys just want to watch tv with you or just talk??
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> Hmmm it is defintitely NOT just men..trust me I know something about this LOL
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> move on, start giving all that sex to someone who wants it
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> however, dont disrespect your parents you dont wanna get kicked out or nothing.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> This boy is like the one im really into and he so cute.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> if you want to take a chance in messing with that, again, its your decision.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> do talk to him n see how he reacts before makin a final decision
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> girl's can't be gay they can be lesbians.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Because woman think everything is gross.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> Anyway...  A perfect person does NOT exist.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> or is the girl gonna think I havee feelings for her?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> I am, but I don't think it gets me anywhere,lol.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> Don't forget good ol' mind over matter.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> U will have ur ups and downs in a relationship.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> not boot boots but it is high heel boots and a skirt thats sweet
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Show up naked, bring beer, don't block the TV.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I waited until I was 28 and it was on my wedding night!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> when you stop doing thing together.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> u prooved to me that u r egoistic by asking this question
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't worry , life or God usualy choose the right thing .
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> So if you're a guy, then pick a girl between 32 and 39 years old.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> some just want it and some try to understand but are unsuccessful.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> Well ask a girl out that you like and see what she says.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> im bi and im married to a guy.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> You sound like a nice person who deserves someone nicer than this guy!!!!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> you shouldn't even be thinking about that at 15.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Stop dreaming abt ur naked GF 6.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> He'll get over it (it sounds like he already is), and by all means do NOT do that again.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> look up on the internet about penis exercises.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> Do you really want a guy that wants a crutch no matter what?
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> (age matters if he is older than 18 and your not, then it really matters.)
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> I you just be yourself then you will naturally attract the one that is right for you.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> If he thinks she's better for him, okay...That means he wasn't good enough for me!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> but ive been with a thick woman b4 out of curiousity.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_40> Don't worry, most of the time Mr.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> i like to feel not see!!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Do whatever you want 2 & b happy & make other people happy 2.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> having sex with my girlfriend without using rubber!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> cuz he thinks he doesnt have too :-/
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Is it because you don't want it to end up in the wrong hands?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> a... Hi how r u ?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> yea.. though there is a person behind it all
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> i am not looking for guy i dont even know sweety you sound just plain Desperate!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> some guys love oral, some would rather give it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> unless... he's already committed to someone else!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Im pretty sure he will tell you exactly what he wants.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> don't act all needy about it
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> Looks + no personality = boring
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> depending where he is looking at.. you know.. ..
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Or something you know he needs or for personal care (watch, wallet, belt...).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> when it interferes with watching sports
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> And dont abondon him as a whole...just be there I guess.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> But then I think - don't I deserve to love someone that much too?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> ummmmmm only men are suppose to be like that?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> :o) And if he really does love you, Keep Him
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> sent her things like candy, flower.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> you can not make anybody love u
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> You never want to be that person saying, I wonder what would have happened if i dated...?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> I know it sounds cheesy buy eyes, they can tell alot about a person.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> hes not like a typical obnoxious jock.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> easy, at that age, us guys have all our hormones all over the plase.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> im sure it would be fine but be safe about it
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_30> Sounds like they wont last long.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> Plus it is freaky and men like freaky stuff!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> IF YOU KNW DAT UR HUSBAND IS A BORN CHEATER DEN CALL ON ALL D NUMBERS.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I am a guy and I respect honestly.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> well, were in the world could your sparm go?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> which would you rather have tongue or dick?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> then, you have an open invitation to start small talk.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Just a man that knows what he is doing!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> HELL no....if he can not take your word for it or just wait until you meet....to hell with him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Age difference 16 years apart but definately she's the one!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> if you have to question your self you are probably gay bra.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> listen to your heart forget what people might think or say it's your life you live it
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> IF YOU HAVE TO ASK ,THERE IS A PROBLEM
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> if he does'nt have someone special in his life and you don't either then what is the problem?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> if you are parting well and you wont regret it, then sure.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> you did the right thing, i would have probley told her to never come back
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Funny to me how many girls ask that question on here, but don't ask what's in it for me?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I reply and we go on!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> thats pretty stupid for someone not to like someone else because of braces!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> if u want to enjoy life , avoid girls
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Thats why its important to be married first!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> If you answer YES on the 1st question then I guess all you have to do is start courting...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> besides, if he's willing to return the favor, you're lucky!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> Only thing is that I tell her before anyone else.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> my boyfriend have a really bad temper , he has beaten me up a few times for nothing .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> you ever have a mouth full of hair?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_35> tell him straight on the face.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> How do I get her to come back.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> all men are just interested in sex.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> brains, boobs, butts, blue eyes, what?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> love and companionship and sometime money
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> because looks can be deceving .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> oh yea, guys who say it don't have little ones
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Right now these 16,17...yr. old boys aren't interested in that kind of thing.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> He starts to say ohh did a guy send u a message and bla blah.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> the guy starts to infatuate about her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> (again it could be because of past happens with the girl?)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> Keep up what youre doing but dont broadcast it
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> ha ha sounds like he is!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> yes, all men can cook, but will they cook for you????
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> YOU JUST CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT THE PERSON.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> He has a shop in Texas...and he is good!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> if you have a fly hanging around you all the time, you want to kill it, fast!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> or when she does go she doesnt say much.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> see i am under cantrol of my self.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> When you flirt with him does he flirt back?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Start with a pet (if you don't have one).
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> but when i meet a hot guy i want to date them.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> i really miss my 1st gf.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_15> -O- MENS,  IT WILL STAY THAT WAY TILL I DIE AND  AFTER THAT.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> But i'd like to beleive that.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> My mom, My middle name, and my friend (but she spells it Deniz)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Just flirt with them or ask for help on homework or something.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> as long as your not under age then it is good older guys make better lovers
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> I think not knowing is worse
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> flowers candy and a soft kiss on th forhead
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> well first of all, u can't show him, but you can tell him.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> You need to make friends with girls not boys.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just ask her to bend over and kiss her butt.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> maybey he is crazy mad retarted?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> I luv to look great each day!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> he is in thatre with me i have had crushes before but never like this he is not gay!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Either way it's gonna hurt you and the family.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> After they watched it, she found it so sexy that they now regularly make tapes!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> hope this has helped you with your answer
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> right me back on my question how do u get a date when nobody likes u?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> Try that and that way you wont have to fake it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> my boyfreind trys really hard some times but some times nothing happens, what should i do?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> when your girl is so loose that its like sticking your thing in a hoola hoop
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> I'm 59 and I go about once a week now so go from there.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> He might like u so he's just staring.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> If she doesnt think you are a good match, figure out why.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> He also shows me he loves me in other ways.......you deserve that.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Have sex with him and test him out......If he cums fast.......he may love you too.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> if he is cheating on you, you should find someone else
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> You don't find love it finds you!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> i am talking abt best freinds not abt married couples.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> HAVEN'T TRIED IT...DON'T KNOW IF I WOULD..I'M SATISFIED WITH MY HUBBY
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> u better b careful if ur really 10.  and if ur not then yea..... lets c stupidgirl0413@yahoo
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> if you love her send her red roses
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> That's pretty mature on your part.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> is that not normal as im a girl then.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> (secrect: to marry, u need not a strong body, u need a strong p.n.s)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> retype this question so all migh know what you are asking ok. boy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> STOP AND PRAY IN THE MIST OF YOUR FINDING BECAUSE ONLY GOD CAN KEEP YOU FROM KILLING THEM.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> You only go around once in this life and you have to take your best shot.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> its perfectly ok of wanting to date a married man, you just make sure you dont get caught.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> try to talk to him after his basketball game .
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> need a ride, borrow a few dollars, etc.).
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> Babygirl, you need to bag that trash up, tie it and kick it to the CURB!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> It's not like she's a stripper.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> If the girl gives attention and importance to her man!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> you can run from that alot of men do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> no, she just don't see you like that and she would rather be just friends
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> been there done that pretty fun
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> i belive there is some out there  for everyone maby youll get that spiecal someone soon
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> That way they don't see you coming and run away.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> think it over hard an then have fun
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> it depends on your personality and what kind of boys you like!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> i would, cause a best friend knows you better than a regular guy and he'll understand you better.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> if you get enough in your system you will be screwing like rabits.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> My ex boyfriend and the father of my baby.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> no date yet but afraid to make bolder move......any suggestions.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> lol I agree with you there Riff.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> During the week, 10 PM if homework is done, 11 PM on weekends
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> i would tell you, but then i would feel bad cause i told her i wouldn't tell
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> You like the same guy that your friend likes so flirting with him would be wrong.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> At this point there should be absolutely no question as to where both of you are coming from!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Should I give up or keep trying?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> mabey u will try this forget about geting married  it will happen when u leat expect it
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> hes not very mature,  you know that already probably.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Don't fret or plan on what to do during sex!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> i think yes bec he seemd like your father or something  ppl will talk about u
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> sorry but im a guy and my wife ask's that same ?

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> ONLY IF SHE'S GONNA BE THE 1 YOU REALLY WANNA SPEND YOUR LIFE WITH DUDE,AIDS AIN'T KEWL
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> ask him if he fell way as you do if he does't some other guy would find you.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> I say go with your heart and you wont go wrong.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Have you asked him what he wants?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> no girls rnt interested in ugly brittish people.....
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> DONT WORRY IM THE ONE WITH THE PIC EVERYONE, THE OTHER IS A POSER!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> kick the devil out of the garden of eden
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> if you care for him then you will wait for his return

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Make sex fun, and even funny at times.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> I use to think so but guys usely want one thing and one thing only.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> you sound young, so i say dont have sex yet.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> it depends on where u go to school and live.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> once a week is once too many for me
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> tell me the fantasies... she is the sexiest thing in the world
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_60> B) Send them right back at him!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> So it matters more about the two people then it does anyone else.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> I MYSELF WOULD SAY THAT THEY PLAY TOO DAMN MUCH.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> I don't like it when they are so big that they take on a life of their own.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> i've already done small things, flirting, dropping off cookies, Hugs & kisses.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> and if long why did you break up with him.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> Well I'm a snap dragon kinda girl..
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> If you want a definite answer any sooner...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> I'M NOT ACCUSING YOU OF ANYTHING BUT I'M SORRY BUT SOME PEOPLE LOOK AT THE STERIOTYPES.

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Good Luck and let me know how it goes!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Both of you would have to comfortable with it or it wouldn't work.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> and you guys will trust each other more and talk about everything more openly.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> the decent guys look for personality.

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> i don't think she should be mad.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> keep trying and all the best.. (^^)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> IF you cant, get someone who both of you know adn respect.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> ask the girl out before she asks u(to be polite).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> as long as there is love on both your parts
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Y does she do this to me?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> just make for her what she really expect from u.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> But eventually it's just not worth hanging around so I left.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> no.. you should wait until you are older and know a lot more about sex.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> the way you notice her and the way she acts around you
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> Don't beat around the bush, say whats on your mind!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> Because youre lookin in the wrong places.

<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> some people use u or just havin sex wit u
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Some people want a boyfriend/girlfriend who they can show off and say Hey look, my bf/gf is hot!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_10> WHAT KIND OF QUESTION IS THAT?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_10> SERIOUSLY BOYS MIGHT WANT TO **** UNEDUCATED GIRLS BUT THEY MARRY THE SMART CHURCH GOING GIRLS.

<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> Deep inside we know you're faking!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> I wouldn't spit on him if he was burning.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> be yourself and let them love you on their own.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> be nice, talk to her, show her u love her( hugs, kisses)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> this is gonna be a tough one for you to deal with.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> Mostly, just show him how much you missed him!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> It seems like you have your life together without her and hers sounds pretty chaotic.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Or else he loves being around you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> YES IT IS POSSIBLE NOT TO CALL PEOPLE NAMES CAUSE IT COMES BACK ON THEM
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> not any longer than you have to!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> That about somes it up right there^
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> i like this boy austin and i told my friend claudia to ask hin if he likes me
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> Man thongs (for the nice physique), boxers (for the uglies)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he dribbles... he shoots... he scores... 2 points...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Not everyone is doing it... even if they say they are.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> 1) To thy own self be true!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> yes BUT not when it makes the girl uneasy in the mall haha
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> and also promise him you won't do stupid things like this anymore.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Tell him he's an idiot and dump him.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> As far as how it felt?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> love is all that you think it is.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> they will look owesome and yummy lol!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Be assured, there are others like you in this world :)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> So i avoided him .even though he wanted 2 take it further.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> However I can deal with short hair but they gotta have an awsome chest!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> just ask him a question that might start up a nice conversation!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> learn how to eat virgina instead.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> yep..you have reached the final clinching step in having your identity stolen!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> instant_karma hit it right on the nose!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> SHOULD YOU HAVE TO WORK AT THEM OR SHOULD THEY COME EASY?
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> 21 years with a 15 year old.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> you're still young, you'll meet many guys.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Probably because he is in love with her.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> The sad part is he is moving to ohio this june!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> ...you just got into conversation with him
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> She should be mad enough to move on.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> just don't do anything too drastic!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> now that is not a great anology but bear with me.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Then try to go with a kiss and if he denies you SORRY.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> let him ask u first if he dident thats mean he have differant plans
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> at least it would have been fun, however long it lasted!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> you can't stop them, but you can ask your guy not to flirt back.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Do I give up and move on?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> you don't know what you have got till it's gone is what they say.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Life isn't as simple as leave him or don't, unfortunately... it all depends on you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> how did you think/reason when you were that age?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> 34-36 sounds pretty darn good to me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> I don't trust my bank even!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> I don't want to listen to their stupidity!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> always look at things from their perspective.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_25> Get a life guy, quit stalking the poor girl.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> HEY  SWEET  HEART    NOT   EVERY  GUY  IS  LIKE THAT SO  I  SUGGEST   YOU  THINK  BEFORE  YOU  OPEN  YOUR   MOUTH.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> You like her then go get her :) !!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> lol funny how did you know you are losing it, did it just come out
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> point- have friends who have completely different taste from you that always works!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I can't wait to see her face at the air port when i return!!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> Race definately can't hold that down... unless your a moron that lets it.. lol ...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> You can imagine what else he's thinking about!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> THANK GOD THAT I WOKE UP ANOTHER DAY AND THEN MY HUSBAND
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> well i first thought of my son who's baby bed was right next to mine.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> You r to lucky got gals for sex so early.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> a lot of things like how thay are.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Tell him that you just snapped and that your sorry.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> there is no specific way to ask a girl out.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> Looks only matter if you want them to...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Or you could talk about the teams he likes.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> And if you ask him your thinking your thoughts :)
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_20> but at the moment its infatuation!!
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_45> but it's better to put him alone and ask.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> what are the do's and don't on your first date?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Just do not give up, even though it is like pulling teeth.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> yea i would cheat on my boyfriend wit chris brown hes so sexy!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> unfortunately some men never grow up
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> six years is not that long for some people, then again, six years is awfully long for others.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> as long as he sees you mean it he sould forgive you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> Of course she might get nightmares, which is bad.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> i have a daughter that just turned 20!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> If you are unsure in any way don't do it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> MY B/F IS LONG DISTANCE AND HE HAS TOLD EVERYBODY EVEN MY BEST FRIEND
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> i would say around her waist.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> not sticking up for her but truly honoring her?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> when he leaves my house i get really sad that he is leaving.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> But I have to make it first...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> ask the doc, or if she is prone to complications them be very careful
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> He says you don't shower enough.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> i am pretty sure he likes me.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_50> share them with your b/f or g/f?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> You need to move on and get over this man.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> add me and we'll talk :)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> i love his eyes and smile
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> if you need to ask this question then your not ready.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Have your fun and realize that it is just that.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> but thats not what we usually think when we look at women.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> ouch that mean why dont u just talk to her or tell her how u feel about her k
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Even the Times Square Urban cowboy has a cowboy hat and boots!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> to find some one  who has same intrest as you do
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> remember that watching porn does not make you a bad person so dont sweat it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> i've been in that position and you just have to wait it out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> we did the wedding and honeymoon all in one, it was cost effective and so much fun!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> u can only have true peace if jesus is in ur heart .
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Hey-i'm having the same problem...you are just missing him right now, its normal and you'll get over it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> i want him to be surprised too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> i don't know why all the people keep giving rude answers.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> if you guys are friends talk to her abou her problem.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> they would like it but it depends, cuz they might not like the girls who are asking 'em out!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> Give me a little spank, would ya?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> figure out which one you really think that you would have a future with
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Lots of times they say they did when they didn't...WITH NO THOUGHT AS TO HOW THIS HURTS THE GIRL!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_5> WOMEN CHEAT ON MEN BECAUSE MENTALLY WOMEN ARE MISSING SOMETHING.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> {BUT WHAT U DO WILL COME BACK TO U}  AND UR HEART IS GOING TOBE BROKEN THINK ABOUT IT
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> When it feels right ... You should wait til your married ..
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> 8 years is not that much.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> I do things to show how much I love my girl, and she does things to show me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> and listen to what he says to see if he is droping hints for you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> I know this sounds funny but it always seems like they don't??
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> And i am running out of excuses.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> There are so many fish in the sea!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_10> GIVE HIM SPORTS TICKETS 4 HIS FAV TEAM
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> guys, much the same way just not to the face.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> How would we like WHO to be a girlfriend?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> say something about gay guys or being gay and see how he reacts to your comment.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> I think it might be for some people...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> usually when someone comes right out and says  i am not.... you know why?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> best to divorce if you want the sex but are not getting it.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> Listen, I'm going to go ________.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> if you think that you should flirt whilist married.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> depends on how well u have build up ur relationship.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> but you already know it; it is so clear.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> NOW ESPECIALLY IF HE IS LIEING TO YOU ABOUT TALKING TO OTHER WOMEN ON LINE.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> IF HE LIES ABOUT IT, THEN THE INTENTIONS ARE DEFINATLY BAD.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> If you didnt trust your frinds would you still be friends with them?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> this one guy i've been eyeing happens to be checking me out too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> i guess i have a radical philosophy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Best of luck to you both!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> If she falls for it, she's not worth your time...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> Hey Im from Patterson----but im 22----cool--small world--crazy little town!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> ( I am only being honest, no disrespect at all)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> And dont forget to get down on your knee!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> its about them, not about you, so put the spotlight on them, not you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> SEX IS SO MUCH MORE PERSONAL, AND SENSUAL WHEN YOU'RE W/ SOMEONE YOU TRUST AND HAVE A CONNECTION W/.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I know this sounds corny but it works.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> It's simple sweetie because they are girls!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Guys can be wierd; I should know.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Whatever you decide to do, don't let her get the best of you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> ok they both are in love with me alot!!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> my boyfriends ex wife hates my guts bad i think she wants to see me dead to be honest.

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> there is a reason why she is your ex.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> Had it for a while there, but kind of a jerk otherwise and didn't go down.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> they know each other only thru internet n telephone... but she wanna marry him...  wat to do?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> Well the question is, what happend???
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> You can even like your mama and I'll be ok with it
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> her juices will not be enough.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Women want their partener to think that they are the one, i.e.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> It is like saying nice guys finish last.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> you dont think there are other females in other places
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> sry if this answer is so ammeture!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> anything else besides that or friendship is gross
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> If you say it ... you mean it!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> just talk to him at frist.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> thats what you call a sugar daddy.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> you are just lifted off of your feet.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> and no it is not wrong.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> go to a movie together, but have your mom drop you off if she won't let him take you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Im always getting hit up by young guys cause im nasty,dominating a say what i want.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> I dont think this is TRUE, but I have heard it (and even said it!)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> got no idea of wat u said
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> yes if you dont want to lose a friend.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_40> How well do you know this guy?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> are you from india because thats what it sounds like.you need help
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_45> Don't take what you have for granted!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> teeth yellow and brown teeth are not only ugly but boy do they stink
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Boyfriend, best friend, Pizza Delivery boy, plumber?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> being totally funny here, the answer is yes.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> when i will have nothing to do
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> or you can wait it out!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> He shoud stay home and grow up
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> you should have told him, btw
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> but if he was not that good of a guy i would dafinatley dump him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> no not at all, its how you use your tool that matters.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> i personaly think thats not right moraly.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> Invite her to a pants party.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> but you just have do what you can for you and your baby.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> to bad for you i feel sorry for you
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> He is really Really hot so........
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> No i dont mean a travel stopover.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> If he quits,  you would be complianing about that too.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> Do you know who came up with that.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> But I apologized for all that.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> I know who i wanna be with, but im a position where i can't choose.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> please... i feel the same way...
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Why can't guys stay focused on one girl?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> Dont worry you'll be aight give yourself a chance to mend your heart!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> don't dump her just because of that; it's much better that she told you.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> Because i'm a dumb@ss, and i'm learning.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> tell him to his face, he will aprechite it better that way x
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> because it helps keep us feeling young.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> when you care about someone, you cant usually see their flaws...at least not at first, lol.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> women cheat too but they are smarter than men and don't get caught.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> the size of the dick dont matter.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> ask yourself how important it really is to you.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> I was in a marriage like this once...and it bothered me.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> until you have a taste of unconditional love you haven't had everything that makes life worth living.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Sometimes you gotta give someone a rap on the beak to get some respect, is that so wrong?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> no need to go pussyfooting around.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> 1's a freak always a freak so if shes down y shouldn't u be?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> wE AGREE WITH FREELOVE AND DEXTER BROWN...HELLO...EVERY GUYS FANTASY TO BE WITH MORE THAN ONE WOMAN AT A TIME...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> it means he is too shy to call
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> you better enjoy it while it last
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> A'm I just being petty or do you think its an issue.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> i hid in the closet when my man's brother n law walked in the house.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> they just would like for us to think they don't.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> is it becasue he is trying to make me jealous?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> and u think u can't afford to lose her/ him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> So pass the tequila, vodka, or even mescal, what the hell!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> so it is best to use a condom or not have sex.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> hav u ever talked to him be for?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> You should feel like a biatch !!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> You probably don't have one yet...if you do you should give it time.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_70> ask to be the best man.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> i met with him last week, i had a good time, got drunk, and embaressed my self.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> 3: Sit around and mope all the time, gain weight, start drinking, or become a druggy.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> any aunties whom i can find in bangalore
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> who is now streaming on the internet.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> my best friend is telling that she had sex with her brother
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> One time I met some girl that dumped me a few years back.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Don't waste your time with her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> to loose like you, he is very unlucky.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> also a change of scenery could help too especially if u have kids.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Go to Walden Books online...they have alot of nice books, with pictures deplicting positions and stuff like that.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> no... less than once is bad
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Jeez - i'm racking up the points tonight
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> Disney World...we wanted to have fun and we did!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_10> TELL HIM GIRL STOP ACTIN CRAZY!!!!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> (but in a better way than what i just said)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> when the time is right he'll ask, how can he not?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> that depends how much money you got
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Some guys do like to make women jealous.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> if its still a casual relationship then no, i would probably not want to be with him.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> sometimes he doesn't care about my feelings.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> why weren't we invited to this 'pity party'?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> some guys used to play with girls because of boastful attitude.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> but if its bcos he forget your birthday (and he did it many times) girl,forget about him.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> beg her to forgive you and don't blame her if she didn't its your mistake from the begining
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> what was it that he did that was so wrong?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> Flirt with him and ask him if he wants to do something on saturday.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> i dont think thats wrong at all...unless they arent of legal age.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I mean, guys compare lengths with each other sometimes, right?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> And do a whole lot around the house.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> i woke up immediately, shocked, and had no idea what had happened.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> i think ive always only suffered because of myself, it just appeared to be because of a woman.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> ask him his phone number or where his house is.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> an apron and some rubber gloves
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> if shes your friend, leave it alone.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> girls love a guy that has guts...even if they are not attracted to him!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> its hard if you continue the relationship with that guy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> (even our teachers think we should go out!)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> I don't think it's simply because you're a gal and he's a guy...
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> my girlfriend is 22 and i am 44 and we get along great!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> I mean what is that really saying about her?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> people tend to play games like that.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> because it's just the sex thing that kept them together and not true love
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> If she says no take it like a real man and say Ok thanks anyway You might be surprized.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Same goes for your domestic version :)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> there are so many different races these days.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> if he likes you he will call back.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> one thing i learned from guys - don't nag them too much or they'll just hide stuff from you
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> but if you care more for the guy, then YOU GO GIRL...lol...just kidding...seriously, go find another man.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I felt like I was in an 80s movie.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> Get the hell away from her.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> try 2 add details lots of them...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Ya sure just ask if hes got a big un.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> Dude, it's like you sort of wanta check yourself.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> PEOPLE TEND TO GET LAZY IN RELATIONSHIPS, AND JOB AND KIDS SLOW THE ROMANCE YOU ONCE HAD.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> just go to a movie or something with him.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> this is not at all a problem... continue with what you are doing
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> maybe she means that she doesn't think she is good enough for you.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> Someone who does not 'need' me.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> that little dab contains millions of baby making sperm .
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> because they are horny too much
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> sit with him and see how he reacts.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> of course i would have you seen brad pitts legs i wouldnt even think twice about it
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> Well thinking like that won't help matters at all!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> - meet with people, try to help other people.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> It's getty pretty lonely up here at NIS.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> u should make being with u fun again like when u guys jus met.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> depending on where you are that might involve a can of paint and a water tower !
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> Out of sight - Out of mind.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_50> spur of the moment and later plan it
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> hell ya but just remember that u cant change a hoe into a house wife so be careful
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> If she says yes...good for you!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> tell them what to ask the guy and what to tell him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> give him a hint ... smile at him or something
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I don't honestly believe I loved my boyfriend.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Just a guess but maybe because you think all men are dumbasses?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> just be honest, you will both feel better
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> - keep try, dont loose your hope.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> well if he says yes thats weird cuz he doesnt no who he's saying yes to.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> i took a big box to her house on her birthday and hid in it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> i mean there jus action figures for gosh sakes...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> ma'am, u r not too old to hangout with a 22 year old man.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> That dosen't sound right... You date Yourself?
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> HOw tall is she first of all?
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_50> hi me from india but sorry not interested
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Stay away from married women and you will do just fine!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> And for your info, I faked once.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> Not a lot of boys like like girls that dress fancy, just trust me!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> Hmmm...casually bring it up one night.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> IF he's broke then please understand.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Valentines day, in my oppinion has gotten too comercialized.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> only girls believe everything they say.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> Tell him he smells like butt and you want him to go home and take a shower.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Not NEAR as long as it takes to get OUT of one!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> tell her off and tell this guy how you really feel before she gets ahold of him
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> Your head is probly playing tricks on u but listen to your heart
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> The hottest thing since Jessica Rabbit
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> try asking some of his friends or even just directly asking her out!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> I dont think its wrong to marry someone way older than you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> if she giggles looks at you like she likes you ask her friends anyone thats close to her
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> If you want to stay with him then you need to step your game up!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> meanwhile i wish u all da best you get someone who matches ur whims
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> he'll think about how he feels and hopefully stop going it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> but if other girls show off theres he can look all he wants.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> relax and do not care, you do not need him to call you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> I CAN ALMOST GUARANTEE YOU SHE'S GETTING IT FROM SOMEONE ELSE, BETTER KEEP AN EYE OUT.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> sex is good but when you find someone you truely love it's a hole lot better .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> by the way im 14 and in 8th grade....
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> Men only know one real way of showing affection, SEX!!!!!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> It not like love between other people outside the family
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> it doesn't make sense to me
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> is someone telling you it is wrong?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> this year i didn't get anything for my birthday.my spouse and i were 18 hrs.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> Be honest and tell her you don't want to get married.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> wait untill you get a little older.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> As for me I've tried with both, and having two men for one girl is definitly the best...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> I guess I'm just looking for something really creative and original, or maybe something traditional--I can't decide!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> if someone else is telling you to stop, you probably wont.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> And you know what, don't wait around the phone.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> do both of you want marriage?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> But to that I say, don't worry about what will happen after.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> i want something different and fun.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> If you have already seen it, watch it again!!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> But most of us are a little off!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> love is caring about a person very much?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> it fells so good but I cant get up the never to ask him out!!!!!!!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> well, don't be a cheater, alright?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> You could also paint or hang out with friends.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> i mean i care about him alot alot!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> Get her nice and drunk, and make it a perfect night.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> friends should not sleep together.. period
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> i dont think the lesbian partner likes you cause she a...um...lesbian!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> tell him your feelings ... if you are shy write it ...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i often wonder what people think bout that.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> to tell you the truth id say its the other way around.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> you obviously want the answer that a woman like that needs no one so why ask it like that.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> a guy will say Hell Yeah!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> It really depends on what type of nice guy you are seeking.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> I don't want a guy ten years older than me.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> now he is lik omg ur a slut ancallin me a liar.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> i do..But now i'm married with someone else.Still i'm in love with the first.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> I can't see myself jumping in bed with my Dad and taking a nap, but that's just me....GOOd LUCK
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> let her know you for what you really are!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> now she tells me she has not other way t deal with it.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> i would react the same way you did.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> i climaxed in a dream when, i think, i was in junior high.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> boys focus more on girls body.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> we learned from the best ... women!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> The girl who had less boyfriends.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> omg, this one is so easy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> so dump him and look for some1 else.. who wud care more about ur emotions for him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> he may said SORRY dont worry and dont become angry.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> playa del carmen, riviera maya, mexico.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> YES THE ONE AND TRUE ANSWER!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> They filmed Some like it hot there.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> Life is short-listen to slayer naked
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> 1ST OF ALL I WOULD WAIT 4 HIM 2 PROPOSE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> But don't go falling all over him, and no begging please.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> um yea that too.... im ok but you hun, are definately not
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> but i think i'll go crazy soon, if nothing happens.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> hey to each his own....but it would be really funny to see that one...
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_60> not if the sex is good
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> when there isn't any trust in the relationship and you realize things dont feel the same
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> To make him choose the one he realy wants to be with
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> WHAT OTHER REASON WOULD HE BE CHATING WITH WOMEN ON LINE?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> you have it no worse than anyone else.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> dont' do it out of desperation just to go to the prom.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_40> im with the person who answered on top
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> you have not even tried to contact me..WHY is that ????
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> yes i want a girl friend but do you want a boy friend  yes or no
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> u don't find your soul mate.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> if he keeps bothering you, don't hang around him anymore.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> if it feels good do it!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> Don't rush, don't start early...  You DO NOT need to practice.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Maybe you got hurt real bad and now you don't believe in love' anymore.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> just try not to push him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> Well, you kind of answered your own question there: cuz he knows other guys will look.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> even if guys are married or w/ a girlfriend, they'll still look at girls.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> because she will only get 1 year of support for every two years married.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> for some girls they feel good b/c they r maturing.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> why is it your job to tell your husband what to do?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> iam a healty thick female and i get attention all the time from guys.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> dont allow him to go meet them.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> u can  talk to me at soccerbabe296@verizon.net just email me and ill talk to u
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> if it hasn't been along time he might not be ur true love.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Give him something practical, cuz guys kinda don't like something just to look at.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> are you a man nurse or a lady nurse.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> DUH< WHAT KIND OF FREAK DOESNT KNOW THAT???????
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> make him understand you truely love this guy.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Only if your ready 4 a relationship.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> if he was a really good guy that i'm really attracted to i would stay with him.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> you because you are nice,make me sick ,sorry ,you are nice,maybe i should have married you!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> You could pluck Daisey petals (he loves me, he loves me not...).
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> check her weight with her height and if it's in rang ethan she's ok.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> or u could ask him to a school dance if you hav one comming up.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> if not , what else would you need?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> Like it slipped past your lips but you didn't want it to.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> expect that who ever you don't choose, will get hurt.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> I wish u lots of luck.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> If not wait til you are mature enough to handle it.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> when i was 14, i had lesbian sex, and dats when i realized that i liked it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> i pay all the bills she paid the rent.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> you're too kind you need to show some defense and toughness!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> SAY U WANT TO WARM THEM UP
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> open your eyes dear heart , hes only playin you !
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> Las Vegas, it was a blast!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> if you were a couple years older i could see why.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> why would you want your friends leftover anyway.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Don't make her unconfortable that will definately make you strike out!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> That's right, he has to do what you say.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_40> Don't wait for a life time, OK?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> It could be exciting for the both of you, in a weird sort of voyeur way.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> hell yes and can i get them lips all over this body jay z is sexy as hell
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> hed probably be thrilled... unless the 3 person was a guy
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> If it were BAD, why even do it once??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> how long you will stay happy after sex???
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> Get rid of the jailed guy too.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> youre asking one or the other or both to despise you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> thats one thing that everybody asks me dont rush it!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> Or maybe just straight up tell you, hey come sleep in the bed with me.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_25> LOL, oh I needed that today.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> depends on how youre partner reacts to it
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> they are attracted to other girls...they are lesbians
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> Keep your pants on and your hands to yourself!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Portillo’s, Da BULLS, Da BEARS, CUBS, AND SOXS!!!!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> Often a guy will vocalize this desire as WOULD YOU FREAKIN QUIT NAGGING ME?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> I prefer hairless except armpit hair I think thats really manish and sexy!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Nothing wrong with that, You go girl!!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> Make the first move if he not reply ask me to be your BF
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> That's a hell of a lot more fun.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> If it works for the both of you then its noones business.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> In person and tell her it was u, all along.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Be who you are and don't try to be anyone else.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_40> i would if he was i nice guy and we connected.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_60> or by the way he acts?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Baby dont hurt me, dont hurt me, no more.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> whatever you know he will like.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Ok, you gotta stop posting stupid questions about your cat.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> because my heart is broken.. .
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> YOu're just not sure what to do.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> it depends where you live and what kind of clubs you have there.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> talk to her not him he can't answer n e of your ?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> thats why there is no perfect man.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> So get out there and have fun, the guys will find you.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> I'm not feelin ya if you know what I mean.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> It shows that they're not always all tough like they try to be.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> he might be thinking u ar still young and there's still time.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_45> has he already cheated on you?
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_45> Sounds like maybe love and hurt
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> But if can't or just don't want to, don't beat yourself up for it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> dont jump to a conclusion that he is cheatin.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> because of getting bored with the same yak!yak!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> and i would have tryed to tell him myself, that way u would have looked confident.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> I Have never met One.. :)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> SOUNDS LIKE YOU HUBBIE IS MISSING A LITTLE EXCITEMENT IN HIS LIFE.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> Kinda makes you wonder if women really care if their man gets off.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_15> MIX IT UP AND TRY TO BE OPEN MINDED AND SPONTANIOUS.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> some do if your luckly you'll find one
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> I don't need him, I want him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> you should let me know if any singles are looking for a cute, and funny girl from g.a
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> what do other people think ?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> I bet your a great person he wants to spend his life with too.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> if sex is the important thing, then marrying a prostitute will be a blast.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Then, whenever you go to meet someone new... NEVER GO ALONE.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> First of all, Choose some one right!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Don't hate the playa hate the game!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> What you did was probably for the best just open up ur options...Good luck!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> becouse true beauty is on the inside but thats just something ugly people say
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_40> good question, let me know too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well u said its cold u dont think thats the perfect thing?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> ---i belive i will some way in the future...just like that...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Oh yeah dont dress too fancy!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> You would not be toying with two guys if you really loved one of them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> i cant find any on yahoo answers!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> or do you just think is about time you get over it?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> If you really like her you will tell her.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> you have to ask your mom though, and go with what she says.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> How do I get a 2nd chance?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Why don't you go back to the baby's father...or, does he not trust you either...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> Hey I wanna know about the enzyte for my other girfreinds who don't love me
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> And when I tell them I am married, 70% don't seem to care, even sadder.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> She always tells me some women just don't.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_35> im guessin its to make her feel good about herself.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> BECAUSE YOU CHOSE NOT TO  BE!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> now doesnt because she got cought and put into consiling.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> otherwise i think that you just need to consider wat they say before you take it too heart.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> different reason for different guys I suppose, but DAMN... Amen to that!!!...
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> im bored to death please talk to me
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> there's probably nothing wrong with that.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> I like a lot of sex, not cheesy romance novel suspense erotica crap.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> i suggest you get this idea out of your head.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> have u tried having sex in the shower?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> i've seen it happen and believe me the friend clique end up dissing the girl.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> or maybe even try to make a little fire to keep her warm!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Some guy with a little boat.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> A GOOD MAN WILL STAND BY HIS WOMAN, AND CARRY HER BURDENS.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Maybe you should find another guy?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> Sorry hunny, Even if you can rock the boat with the best of em, if I'm not feelin ya.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> No... he likes women who are older and less desparate...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Hate me now if u wana...one day u will thank me...
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> Sounds like you just have to ask.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> take the one with the less girls ok he is better 4 u.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> If she says no...how did she say no?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> OR USE THE BEST BUY GEEK SQD TO DO IT FOR YOU.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> your better than that , you dated him once , move on hes old news
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I probably dream about sex about 4 times a week.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> if she says no, then say well we cant have that!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If he hasn't already, then good.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> She was really boring... AND SHE BELIEVED IT!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> a man NOOOOO WAYYYYYY,they r born e big eyes
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> then out of the blue some chick is going to wake up and realize d@mn!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> One who will make you whole.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> he must know how to laugh...
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> but you know, the internet also has some liars.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Do u guys think he likes me back?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> absolutly  not  how  would  you  feel  if some  one  did it  to  you  ?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> don't be shy or you might lose her to another guy!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> See if that works 4 u :)
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> one of the machanics are so hot.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> going back to your question... i don't think you like them both.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_10> NOT ME!I'M TOO BUSY WITH A FEW LADIES ALREADY..LOL
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> maybe you should learn english before you do anything.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> ok don't understand you are bi-sexual.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> go away for the weekend some where romantic
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> because we are just like that
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_20> Hell no man.... come on you know better.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> is it her time that you are jealous of?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> All this right in your own home!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> do you want to marry her?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> and he decided he wants to be celibate until marriage?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Just a quirky turn-on I guess.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> (Not that there aren't any who are built that way but I generally only see them with black guys!)
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> WHEN I FIRST STARTED DATING HIM I WASNT ACTUALLY PLANNING TO FALL IN LOVE AT ALL!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Drink with him and have lots of wild and romantic sex!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> so please don't report me .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> the only thing that you can do is to stop kissing her.. let her discover why...  good luck!
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> be confident abt ursel dear girl.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> how much of controlling wife are you anyway?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> It's gonna be hard as hell but you have to give yourself time to get over him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> Choose the one with bigger boobs.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> Maybe he wanted to wait til marriage.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> that depends on how long awhile is, and how much you really cared/loved the person.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Again missing some details...ok there is jewery and flowers.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> It can't work with just one of you trying.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> OMIGOD girl, my guy has forgotten so many annaversaries, or just been broke on my birthday.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> If you really care about the guy, give him another chance.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> No one think that you are a freak.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Fall in love with each other all over again its sooo much fun .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> ITS NOT IMPOSSIBLE BUT IT IS NOT VERY LIKELY!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> Guys and girls all think differently.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> Um.....they will flirt, stare at you maby.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> But if you don't feel right about it, don't do it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> wll make it easier,the rest is dealing with those personal feeling each has.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> dont talk to him, act like it doesnt bother you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> how can i get on good terms with her?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> no that would be a stupid idea
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> try a search directory or try a website on searching for ur friends.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> leave him alone...he seems a'little preoccupied....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> How long do u want 2 stay married or alive?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> So say, 'heh pal, i'm ready so if you're not, you're also not for me!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> You're young, there's probably many people out there who'd like to hang out with you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Next time, please don't do things like that again.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> ---> WHEN YOU MARRY THE BLOKE!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> A best friend would'nt do that to someone she really cared about.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Why do you girl always encourage relashionships ??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Yep, you guessed it divorce a big waste of your time.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> I hope you learned your lesson,Cheaters Lie!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> because if are parents find out we will be killd.

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> stay with your partner and keep going strong supprort them and love them
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> you are just perfect for each other and you know that when you are with him.

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> JUST DONT GIVE OUT PERSONAL INFO.

<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> if the person understand u and your feelings, and like u fo what u are
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Maybe because they never had it before

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> he's real cute but obnoxious he would stop brothering me and can't stop flirting with me.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> What if there is no god?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> You are too young right now.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> &#92;some1 nice hot good listener playful sexy
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> I think alot of them want something they can't have.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> the best thing to do is try to become the kind of person worth marrying.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Well, I think if you care about her be honest and tell her.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> the eyes is the main thing so my answar is eyes
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> you should email me at myname@yahoo!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Try investing your time in a woman (LADY)!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> No, not at all, we can all like whomever we want.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Add me to the guys that don't like you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> ditch this guy for one who's trustworthy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> But you shouldn't pick fights with her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> first expect to get hurt, it's goin to happen, and you'll learn from it.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> You said I love you too and you didn't mean it??!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> She HAS herpes and she didnt get them from you playa!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But don't worry about masturbating even more than once a day.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> this is the only life we have dont waste it sitting around wondering.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> that's y its called FALLING in love... Go in public & express yourself...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> You better see if his family has heard from him or something!?!?!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> The good ones do, don't worry about the rest of them sweetie!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> i wouldent want to  have sex w/ a 42 year old man
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_25> boys come a dime and dozen.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> i will be online for u...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> dont wait for him to ask you out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> its a boyfriend so there is nothing really special about it unless its the longest youve had a relationship.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> he told me friday he would pick me up at 9 or 10 but never called or showed up.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> i later found out that my cell phone didn't have service for like 40 min.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> He would think you were a vegaterian
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> CD of a band u kno he likes
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> say it as many time as you wont she no what you mean
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> You'll have to get over them eventually,... right?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> if it were a guy, he'll probably think about it first.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> but once they get 2 their teen years they feel more comftable w/themselves.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> why am i such a boring person i can't think of any thing to say?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> Be like a guy whom you are.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> If he likes u, he may avoid talking to u.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> Telling her how u feel about her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> and god bless your unborn Baby boy!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> this is what we call challange!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> I gotta question 4 U why are we president and not females... We must not be that stupid huh?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> Just tell that guy you have a boyfriend and you're not interested.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> If not don't take it too hard, you're a great person.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> when its time for you to fallin love, u will no matter how you resist (ask me)!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I really felt good when i wnnt out w/ him and we did hav fun somtimes.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> THERES NO AGE TO MAKE OR HAVE A CHILD why?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Music that both of u like, mood lighting, and some natural stimulies.
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_30> i still cant forget about him!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> If she doesnt respond to u in say....2 months, then take all that engery and move on.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_95> u may still have a chance.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> no problem that i can see.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> its the difference between your man walking outside naked and someone else doing it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> anyway i wouldn't hate one but doubts ringer in ma mind-why would one sell herself out?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I loved him then, I love him now and always will.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> if i make the first move on my shy guy what if he gets put off?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Take his hand, slide it down ur as*s, then say, Honey, i've been a very bad girl.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Talk to your wife, does she flirt?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> that you both could be together... jus maybe....??
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> YOU DONT ALWAYS NEED LOTS OF MONEY TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> make corej to tell him personaly
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> you can`t chase two hens at a time!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> Say to him How's Sarah doing?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> Fa Sol La Ti Do ... yup, I sure do ...
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_60> I mean you under 18 and he older than 18 no!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> pick the one u wood regret not being able to c the most.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> But I don't have any idea of where to take it!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> If you don't mean what you say, then don't form the words!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> dude you graduate high school and probably in collge and she was just born.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> if there is love, nothing else matters
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> some do if deyr da shy type den dey do
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> No, lots of straight men have their right ears pierced.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> on thursday he called me to go out but i refused becuase i was with friends.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> I guess you don't like him the same way?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> repeating yourself over and over isn't working well is it?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if he ever cheated on me i would try to work it out no matter what.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> EVEN THOUGH MEN CAN BE JERKS SOMETIMES.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> i never forgot it though, and finally realized what had happened.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Kid's like new things just like mommy and daddy.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> there are tons of girls out there, and straight ones, or bi if thats what you want.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> its not a good relationship if you fight and nothing gets resolved...you should leave him
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> I mean how will you ever know now?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> it's so nice of you... but are you sure that he won't be mad with what you are doing?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Does he like me or does he just like flirt?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> not sayng anything just maybe u should talk to guys
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> If you enjoy books...look in the bookstore.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> So i guess they will just have to see it with there eyes.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Now she doesn't pick up the phone or return emails.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Give it to someone who will give it back to u.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> coz u r very smart & had chosen the right way
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> choose the one who care you most..
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> there are web sites where you could buy nice jewery for reasonale prices.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> A little thing call the truth might work!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> See you r 24 years old, u can not make a girl friend just because u r shy?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> BECAUSE HE LOVES YOU A LOT AND WANTS TO KNOW YOU EVEN BETTER.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> c. Not asking for a blasphemous thing (such as sex) without even thinking about why it even exists (reproduction).
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> just go out (i assuming with other guys) and don't look to be in a relationship, find friendship first.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_10> U SEE SOMETHING U WANT GO FOR IT !!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> And Can we tell when you fake?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> if he is just one or two years older then you shoud.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> You men wonder why we are so b****y. Lol.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i broke up wit him yesterday.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Remember that your feelings don't matter- JUST THE CHILD'S!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> get after it bubba..get all you can now ..cuz it don't get any better ...lol
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> if you never see the other person, when you finally do, they might not be who you remember.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> hes not the only cute guy in the world!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> give me your info and ill find you a perfect match .my adress is david19bear@yahoo.com
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> So, if you can tease her and play hard to get, I guarantee you sucess!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Men only have one tool, which often isn't enough for just one girl, so why two girls?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> try logging in to friendster.. =)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> Not to mention THAT will probably piss the wifey off.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> say something like would u like to have dinner with me this friday?......duh.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Now big hands AND big feet and there is NO doubt.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> that's what i would like to know
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Show her that you like her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> But now you need to do what is best for you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> im actually bi, but im going out with boi right now.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> depenns on ur looks and attude
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> dont do it he has alreay lost his chance
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Why do guys cheat on girls?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I would do anything for him.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_30> This is something women generally know well and something guys just don't seem to get.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> u can't give candy to a kid then take it away without some kind of reaction
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> you can still be his girlfriend though, even if she doesn't let you go on dates.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> well i would just wait a while don't go fast u'll find someone
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH GAY PEOPLE THEY ARE JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> Why do you need to pick out just one girl anyway?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> If your not comfortable then don't do it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> Me and my best friend think they're dead sexy!!!!!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> are you guys getting marry any time soon?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> Of course, you could always recommend a day job... works for me!
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_30> you might be a little crazy
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_10> MOST MEN DONT REALLY CARE ABOUT SATISFYING THEIR PARTNER.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> the way you feel about someone and when you are in love you wont have to ask
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_25> (in about 3-4 LONG relationships) You just need to realize it yourself.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> you can't really walk around at night the city shuts down at 7pm.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> but i only did it once.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> Get her trust if that doesnt work get her drunk.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> But if he don't eventually listen to you don't worry about it you have other friends.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> i hope he says yes though!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> use a broom made from roses
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> Yeah, I just made it to level two , also.....I don't think we get any brownie points for that.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> pple just judge tooo much on look;s..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> yes i like the movies i think it is a good time to get close to your man
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> but if he is 10 or more years older than you, i wouldnt got there either
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Most women never get angry at little things!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_65> Yes there are...   FYI There are prostitutes around the world...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> ), would he want such a passive, retiring girl?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> to make females think they are smart.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> If you are a boy, I don't know...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> If she was a good freind then she wouldn't insult you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> should i feel guilty when im rocking there world?!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Sound like she tell him what to do .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> If you say want me to warm you up that sounds like a bad line.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> if she really is ur best friend, she wont mind hearing ur oppinion.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> much luck and talk no screaming only puts walls up ---then no one is listening
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> 48...and since you have no idea of what the person's life experience is, give the advice anyway.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Before, I thought it was ok that a guy penis size matter.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> no you respect that one of a lifetime guys If his for real girl dont mess up
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> Its a weird psychological thing, but it ALWAYS seems to happen!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> Say something like I knew a girl once who likes threesomes... see where the conversation leads.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> And both of them (bro & sis) mainly remain alone at home , so ,it take place .
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> cuz if you dont love your self, then how can you be loved.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> are you going to cheat on your wife?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> i think thats the best way to describe what women feel and why its so hard.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> cold is always good if u think about it from my perspective!!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_25> but dont give ur guy a hard time.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> well go with the flow do wat she wants
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> if you want tell me and I can probably share a doosie or 3 with you!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_50> Wow, if ever I knew that that guy wanted you it would be now.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> It's a dance with lots of people in socks!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> If you wouldn't want your wife doing it, don't do it yourself.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> I say give her a bit of space.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Only stay with him if he spells like you do.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> dont send him flowers what ever you do!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> is it ok or even morally right to let someone piss on you?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> when he/she is there, ul feel it.
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_35> if he is going to fast whisper slower.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> I don't know what to tell you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> most women don't know how to make a man have an orgasm - it just kinda happens.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> Hope that helps and best of luck.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> but figuratively, you should do something she haven't seen yet that will definitely surprise her.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> YES YOU ARE THE GREATEST !!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> Be fresh always  Don't flirt a lot with her.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> well im 26 amd i love to talk to differnt people and meet new friends spongebobfreak79@yahoo.com
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> okay one of my good friends is 15 years old and use to cut herself.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> If you are a Guy and in love with another guy flowers can go ...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> YES I DO...BUT I CANNOT SAY WHY..TOO PERSONAL TO EMBARRASSING
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> a guy who gives attention only to his girl, and he is a football player.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> let him know after 3 years if he cant trust u now then he probally never will.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> just go outside, watch a different tape or DVD, do anything else, keep busy.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> He wont sick a bull on you!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> eyes and smile first, then chest, shoulders, arms, etc
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> now, you're not the only other important person to her - there's the boyfriend too!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> let her down easy just say blank i'm sorry but we have 2 break up
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> so, my advice is talk to her.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> i think if he has found a religion i would support him in that!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> no.one girl would get jealos if u pay more attention to the other girl.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> you are sure yo get one.and it is safe too
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> & the older you get, the less age matters anyway - a decade isn't that much.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> That's a good way to seduce me...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> She is a freak and she would definitly come right over if I called.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_45> marriage is b/w 2 people .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> talk about rude but anywayz.... somebody PLZ HELP!!!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> Scary movies are good cause then she has a death grip if she is afraid.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> DO NOT watch any sappy romantic movies...only comedies!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Good thing your not married or you would be in so much trouble.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> love me till the day i die.....no matter what i look like.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> don't you thing all people have the right to get marry, even if they are gay?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> sometimes u can tell by how he looks at you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> tell him you have been naughty abd you need a spanking
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> my wife likes to pee on me and i get off to it, but thats us.

<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> my id is tosalar@yahoo.com  if u like me add me
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Wait for him and don't flirt with anyone but him!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Guys I don't like(guy friends) say I'm beautiful.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> If you have problem with racism they drop the idea...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_15> WHILE PUTTING IT IN THERE TALK DIRTY TO HER AND RUB YOUR SENSEUAL AREA.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> Just like guys, some cheat some don't.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> the wa i see it, u need to bring he's attension back home.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> don't be afraid and get married it will be a succesed relationship if you both take care of it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Hey as long u get what u want just say whatever.
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_30> Move on to a guy who'll treat ya better!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> im not sure if this has been asked already if so im sorry but jw
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> He replied and said, I don't know what to say.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> Could you be just friends and hang out with lots of people?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> and if you really think about it.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_40> i met someone like that once.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> But u shud look @ various other aspects, too.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> he even broke up with my ex for me.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> My girlfriend is jumping up and down, going It's a dance!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> How stupid is to say, no thanks, strictly into men.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> he is busy at the moment.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> never heard of someome wanting permition to argue.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> Just walk up to her (with a smile) & ask her

<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> you shouldn't have to worry about that!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> yes .. it does.. girls like it long .. your stamina also matters!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> When you were a kid, you wanted the other kid's toy.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> let me know how it goes.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> tell her this; make your self more beautiful.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> Just go up to her and say Hi.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> You can definately tell when its too late.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> the one I want's name is Eric and he's so fine(literally)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> well u could just casually bump into him and start a conversation.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> my hand is my girl atleast a few times a day.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> if you like yourself that is all that matters honey !
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> it depends on the kind of boy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> And you would probably do so again.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> if u love him back go out with him, if not tell people to stop buggin ya!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Life is all about Pick & Choose
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_45> after all you want to chat.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> If he isnt okay with that, then I would start thinking about leaving.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> the true perfect man is man that she loves.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> i'll say, when ever it happends (pregnant)... that is the right time.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> Hope this helps and didn't confuse you even more.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> no because you are only cheating yourself.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> You suck it up, wish her well, and move on.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> A side question - do you ever look at other men?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> size is not important , I prefer a guy I love , only this is important to me ...:-)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> the worst...the traffic, the prices of homes
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> But look them in the eye when you say so.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> they're all the same...like cars...just different models.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_45> most boys on body but some do the personality
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Don't say want me 2 warm u up cuz that sound cheezee just warm her up!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> listen to her.take her to dinner date.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> If what you got right right now is what you want, why screw it up!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> courd to take a real step by knowing a real person, or cheaters if they already have a realationship

<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> But we shared alot and got really close.

<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> you should ask yourself how much you love him.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> jumped out of a story and a half window because her dad was walking the back door.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> If he says no at least you know it is time to move on to bigger and better things...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> THERES NO WAY TO ACTUALLY MAKE URSELF FALL IN LOVE.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Hey man do what you want!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> When I found it, I married her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> Even ones that are as Funny as his.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_10> THEY STILL LOVE THEIR GIRLFRIEND AND WIFE BUT STILL THEY MESSED AROUND.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> you are trying to be a playa and you will nly play yourself because, what goes around comes around.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> because if he was u would love it and enjoy it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> what eva position you make will be the position you use so do wat eva you feel is right!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> cause we generally are not homo !
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> Two guys really like me and i really like both of them to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> They are out there you just have to be patient and find the right one
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Dude if I say if it feels good how could it be wrong?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> but most of all, he gives me his love.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Im 16 now and Im madly in love with my boyfriend.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> But what I want is looks and brains.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> Plus..my ex cheated on me, thats why we are exes.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> Yeah, you can respect him...good for him!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> if so dump his azz in the street.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_55> the guy has a few screws lose in his head.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Is it a problem if my shirt isn't exactly filled out?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> why are you asking just the men?!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> your in school honey you want to be accepted.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I told him that I felt like I was falling out of love with him and it scared me.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> it is provided you make it clear before actualy start cheating,,
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> what if he goes with me?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Oh yeah and they eat and poop a lot.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> you sound like u r in a market mall or an auctioneering parlour.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> i think girls that like to sing are cute.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> yes, it is fabulous isn't it?!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> because that's the way it's supposed to be
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> so it's probably just harmless fun.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> be your self and you will find someone
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> Say something and bring her to counselor  :)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Just be yourself and don't push the issue with her....K
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> continue you seems to like being a slut.and a wicked person,why bother to ask this question.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> not if you want to keep your marriage.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> or you are just saying that cos he's your friend?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> forget about it and find yourself a different guy
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> hi say hi back now we friends
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> I was a very sexy girl, I have a hard time feeling sexy even feeling good about my self.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> Do they cut the head off bunny wabbits???
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> Nothing, I am not gay, I love woman!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> does he see it ending in marriage).
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> !...of course on the premise that the third person is a girl.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> That's not true, that's just the deamons fuckin' with your head!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> ive read somewhere that even the most sexually aggressive woman doesnt make the first move.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> they are faithful to them and no one else.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_50> yes if that person is christ.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Men that are madly in love won't cheat.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> If she isn't interested you now you need to move on.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> When was the last time you heard a straight guy tell another guy...Yea man, you look great!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> but god will have taken his people before all this happens .
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> something interesting and sweet yet not too mushy.
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_35> :) go for it--whats the worst?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> YES MEN DO CARE ABOUT WOMEN FEELINGS...THE GOOD ONE'S ANYWAY.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Yeah, here some, skip the small stuff.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> if he's lieing about that just think what's else he lies about .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Think about what he likes and what he likes to do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> either when your married or when your ready and with someone you truely love
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> FEEL IT ,KNOW IT,THINK IT, DREAM IT, INVITE IF ALL THESE FIRST AND FAL IN LOVE
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> Same reason guys cheat on girls...monogamy is really kind of going against the grain and can get really boring.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> But if you ever find it, send it my way!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> The minute some other girl picks up the shirt you want it even more.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> I mean they couldn't make a better porn movie.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> If you love him that much then stay with him and forget about marriage.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> if he's in a relationship, dont go there,.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> I know it's hard but girls like a guy who plays hard to get.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> realize whats really going on and learn from it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> I USED to...it was fun my friends and i even wrote our own !
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> Age doesn't always play a big part unless it is like 15 and 23..then it would be illegal.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> your tell her you like her
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> And I really don't care, I'm not jealous--she can have him and his lies.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> too many people have unprotected sex and have kids when they are still kids themselves...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> That'll depend on what type of girl your looking for.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> But anyway, I do not brag my son around because I know it is annoying to people.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> THATS WHY MY NOSE HOLES ARE NO LONGER HOLES, THEY HAVE FILLED IN FOR GOOD.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> i would not take it personally althought you probably dont know how else to take it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> HE IS COMMITED TO YOU THAT'S WHY.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> If she is still living at home with her parents tell them!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I can help with lots of sex questions
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> a just right size with all the right moves is where it's at!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> How much time are you gonna waste?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> put flowers all over her car
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> If she is drunk that helps.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Love is knowing that everything is OK!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> You need to quit wasting your time with this guy and find one.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> yeah take it as a compliment
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Chris was not that great anyways.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> yup, i met my bf on line and we are still together after 6 months
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> SUCK IT UP ... there a world outside of YOU .. its called your marriage !!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> If you r always thinking about the break-up, then you will always be moping around.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> call me i will catch a flight :)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> It's all in your head, you just need to be confident.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> u kiss him in front of the girl he's dating
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> no, just choose who you want in your heart
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I had to think abuout it for about 10 seconds but I guess no.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> If u r looking to have sex and nothing else, I suggest u do not get married.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> if he calls less than usual and when you question he studdas
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> alone time, just the two of you
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> ask a lady which is the best way to seduce a woman..
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> roses mean love try lilleys or somethin sweet
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> If thats something someone does...the least they can do is not do it around others.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> I would get reported if I told you so just Google it.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> LIKE IF THIER UGLY OR CUTE
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> we cannot stop someone from hurting.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Go for a good horror movie, you will get more hugs and cuddling  :)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Depends on how much potential he has :).
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> he's trying to make you feel special and loved, but that doesn't mean that you are in love.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_40> There's a great little book that you should both read Don't Sweat The Small Stuff.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> And sometime i fell like i need to ask him to marry me.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> If he is your b/f,then he's suppose to love u.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> if they keep bugging you tell your parents, the mall security, a police officer.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> If you want a reality check, then look at this.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> But if there is to be any connection, he's gonna have to love your personality!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> endorphines are released when you orgasm
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> Now, if he doesn't bring it up tonight, that's okay, don't panic.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> If not don't call her again.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> For women and their guy going ....that just ain't right.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> wen u kip thinkin bout the person and you feel the need to be wid him.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> when you are good and ready!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> i'd say like right after u get married ----ur twenties??
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> just let them two do there thing and you will just have to learn to live with it.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> i find that guys are more likely to share things with close friends.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> She leaves her parents' home n adopts ur home n treats it as her own.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> Some women are moody , just ask if she likes you in that way
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> let the guy regret about dumping you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> it sounds like you better break it off now.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> absolutely no talk about ex's, yours or hers!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> get on with it.. if he likes you im sure he'll look to you.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> shoot idk give him a lap dance or at least sit  in his lap
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> if hes really getting to your nerves find somebody else.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> how do they know what works?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> you deserve to be treated better than that!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> to love and charish until death do you part.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> If she doesn't flirt, then you shouldn't either.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> Because you don't like a pain in your butt.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_30> I saw it on here somewhere and it just blew my mind.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_35> I have no idea what to do around a girl.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> and not just any old friend, but your best friend.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> But u know when u find him sneaking peeks at u when he thinks u're not looking.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> you should buy yourself something very sexy for in the bedroom.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> 2 pints of stella and a smile
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_50> advice isnt by age give ur opinion!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> hopefully another 15 year old will answer yes...anyone older than 17 is gross and illegal.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Why don't you like the guys who you hang out with?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> pick the one that u enjoy being around the most.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> but if other girls are involved, i'd probably join him to check out the competition.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Hang in there it's called giddiness!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> be a lesbian although i dont look down on them i just dont understand!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> I ran out of soap-powder...can you please land me?
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> 17 the summer b4 my senior year
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> Yes he would, but chances are that would be a good thing.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> Definately trust, it makes sex much better
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> just remmber most od the divorses in the usa are related to money sooooooo be smart
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> Am I in the relationship just for what I can get out of it?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> well i never thought that i could love someone again.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> What if her life is not going so well?
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> u should still run away unless u new him or her because he&#92;her might b a stranger
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if not, then you are very lucky, if so, then it is not good
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> i have a huge sex drive and my wife does not.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> ask them if theres a reason, and how should you go about fixing it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> But I don't see man coming together around a camp fire to sing Kum Ba Ja anytime soon.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> try to see if he notices u. make even a comment like excuse me.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> its the only way you can be sure.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> busting his balls and his friends balls.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I WANT TO KNOW WHAT THEYthink about mixed marriages
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> the rain drops are falling on my head.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> I think its alright if you date.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Enough to see him for who he really is besides hot!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> you are to young to be on here asking for dates...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> But, dont be a bum and expect the girl to always pay.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> if he goes out of his way to hang out or talk to you.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> sure, but will she stick to him......
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> U know how to see if your with the right guy???
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> its possible that they are just friends.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> do you think i guy would be impressed if  you gave him flowers?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> u should let him sweat u!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> because you're not happy with yourself
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> i have 3 kids, with 3 diferent dads, and none of them want much to do with us.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> you dont need a man to feel inpotant.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> i dont know.....it depends on how is your relationship!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> dont let him know you asked that question
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> I'm afraid if I don't she'll leave.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> you do it because its what you believe in.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> I do to but I can't explain it
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> If you want to have your fun - fine!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> to get attention and simpathy but im only guessing.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> no or you can be brave...and ask.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_20> if you stick with one partner, and use protection, then it's not bad, it's good.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> Honestly, I used to think it was never a big deal to cheat on my boyfriends.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_15> RUN IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION AS FAST AS YOU CAN!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> ask her if you could give her a call and get together sometime, or hang out.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> well it depends on how old u are and what the both of you have discussed regarding marriage.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> hes probably right Dont get him>
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> IT CAUSES A LOT OF PROBLEMS IN OUR RELATIONSHIP.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> im 8 and I like tom felton and he is 18 how should I know
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_15> LISTEN TO YOUR HEART IT WILL NEVER LIE TO YOU!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> If she has said she just wants to be friends it is already too late.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> because he sounds like a pus.sy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> I don't think Chris like mean drunk girls that hang with SynergyPr.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> just tell him you have bf .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> I mostly forgot that I had them since I still thought like a little kid.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> i think yes,by killing the people that ruined this earth
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Just start with an hello, DOn't go where ever she goes.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> some people say yes and some says no.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> just do it with confidence and watch out for her dad and brother.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> or be next to him the whole time
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> because thats the way of men some do and some don't
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Honestly, guys don't really care about their gifts.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> I'm a guy and girls certainly don't fall for everything I say.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> a home cooked dinner is also nice.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i love this fight between blonds and brunnets.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> it depends if you are a boy or a girl.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> If you are a girl it hurts (kinda a lot).
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> i went on a date with a guy last 2 saturdays.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> But if it's good then I'll be happy if he whants to go with me.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> If you are a Christian & you wonder WHY???
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> I need a girlfriend pretty badly.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> what can i do to get her back and to give me a second chance.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> it means she is sort of a whore
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> wait for atleast someoen who is mroe mature relationship wise.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> I don't think they are terribly expensive either.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> there is no such nice way to tell the girl that she has a bad breath.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> and what if he is attracted to older girls.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> you don't really need to know this bc it's personal, and none of your biz.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> or you can snuggle up with some good movies at home.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> oh, man lol  I need to be put in my place once in a while.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Try it once, ask a boy out and you will find out why!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> If he does not, he will spank you for spanking him!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Hell, he could have just fallen asleep.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> you dontttt like me and gigggle  they have to respond
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Besdies this might drag other girls.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> it all deppends what u did that was so bad becouse some things are unforgiveabal
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> You always want what you can't have.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> Do I look Butiful I really look like this  I am not Playing
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> when u fall in love and when ur parents approve your relationship.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> TRY TO RECONNECT WITH YOUR HUBBY.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> any excess is bad whatever it is your husband should  balance his time between family and friends
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> :) Good Luck and if she is stuck up, find a new girl.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> that sounds racist.. at least for me since i'm asian.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> they are not only unsane,but their the ones that man can`t live with out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Since I don't want to be the person I just described...BYE-BYE
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> to make a long story short...we've been married 22 years
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> hmm never would have thought it...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_20> Once you could ride it that's when you know it's good.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> Cheer up bro, no matter how bad things get in life there is always something good awaiting you.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> That is always a great gift!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> NO HED PROBLEY THINK HE WAS IN HEAVEN..IF IT WAS WITH ANOTHER GIRL
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> if not honey just keep on keeping on.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> girl don't be scard .scard get's u no wher .just go to his face and tell him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I love going to the movies.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Helicopter rides over the grandcanyon lots of shows!!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> The first time I had sex i got pregnant.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> and it doesn't mean she's a whore.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> yes u will when the right person comes
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> If they are with someone they really like, they don't care what movie.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> I don't think THATS a good offer.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> simply try to be with her when she needs you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Sometimes women treat their man wrong and take them for granted!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> DROP HIM IF HIS PARENT SARE INVOLVED.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> i think that will sum it up.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> I BELIEVE IT'S JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT KIND OF JUST HAPPENS!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> its blind because we believe an illusion and not what really infront of us
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> if he gave you a hint that he too has plans.. ask casually.. why don't you go with me?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> You could also get a gift certificate for Wal Mart...then he can get something he wants(guys like that)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> 17..on prom night but i didn't go to prom..lol at least i did one thing right
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> Worst: All 4 seasons (in one day), kind of boring
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> make it special so you wont have any regrets.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> maybe every once in a blue moon she will ask about my son.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> you got a yahoo messanger screen name?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_40> !if that is what my man likes the most,urs will 2!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> So go get 3 of your best gal pals get on line and book a cruise...you will love it!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> see who you like or ask someone out.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> A devoted wife what you make of her.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> Second there is more to life then ott guys...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> And if you can't handle it girl, then move on.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Fine if your single,  NO if your married.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_25> Like i always say why buy the cow wen u can get the milk for free!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> why would you want that auguments just start you dont set a date or time or say please.
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_45> Am I committed to the relationship no matter what?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> why arent you having sexual relations with your partner?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_35> how certain are you that she wasn't sexually or physically abused?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> GO INTO CHAT ROOMS THAT ARE YOUR PEER GROUP......INTRODUCE YOURSELF.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> keep on keeping on, unless you really value your freindship, but if not, nut away!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Yes I do, because the first time I ever layed eyes on you, I knew I was in love!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Magic eight ball says ask again later
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> If she does, she will let you know!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Flurting with her is one way.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Get her to talk to you about HER.)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> do you need practice for the hell that is to come - marriage ?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> my boyfriend gives me all that i need and all that i want.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> If not, no its not OK.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> old of difrence, but u cant really tell
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_15> MEN CHEAT ON WOMEN JUST FOR SEX BUT THEY STILL LOVE THEIR WIVES.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> and has a urge to have sex and mess around.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_35> he dont want you and he aint neva gonna call
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> No, you son of a bitch.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> that is the first thing they look at.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> i donna i usually focus on both i like a smart and pretty girl
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Your not a cat, your a person, and if you think  your a cat, seek help...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Just some things to think about.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Pick the one that will always be there for you and who spends time with you!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> look her straight in the eyes......... and keep refilling her glass.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I hate to say it but probably not, especially since you have not talked on the phone.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> well, u gotta defind what types of girls we r talkin about here!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> I prefer a filthy rich man!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> i don't think so, you can't help what you are attracted to.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> Sounds like he may be the one!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> because we are not the same
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> i guess u are pretty down now right?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> i've tried to go out with other guys, he was jealous,but didn't want to get together again.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> but there's many men out there who won't.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> Just try it and let us know how it goes!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Why do i sometimes do things that hurt me?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> ask her out before somebody else does.you have nothing to lose until you have it!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> it about how a person treats you.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> never mind him if he thinks his all that he doesnt deserve you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> i have a slightly big nose but not big ears.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> Don't start spoiling her on the first date or she'll think she owns you!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> ?--so u can do it with a person u really really trust
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> well i got laid off and was still paying the bills but spending to much time around the house.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Even if she says it is ok, she probably doesn't mean.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Wait til he makes the first move
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> If you get a broken nose when he turns your way, your luck's in ;)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> what do you think about that?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> What do you mean by r/n - roommate???
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> just play your cards right and be honest.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> Or just pick up the phone and say Do you still love me?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> when you want to get married which include commitment, trust , love, etc..
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Its not like my ex's friend and I are dating, we just like eachother.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> You  prop up his stupid ego and that's it- get rid of him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> i look for there personality and how they respond to me.and that they way more then me
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> find a way to make him jelous and then mention that it bothers you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> and you won't have time to whine on the computer anymore.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> love is blind because all the negative things about that person suddenly don't matter anymore.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> Make a list of things you like about each one.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> go for the one that u can relate most to
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> if you don't wanna do that,then try hanging out with him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> I miss and love her so much...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> If you have a problem, then, sit down and calmly talk about it!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> then ask him if he will like to go out some time.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> going out for dinner or to the cinema
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> yes it makes u more flexible
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> the girl would have to be a real jerk to want to do that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> smart guy, you had the chance, you let it go.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> So, I'm sry if this didn't help but I hope it does.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> do u stare,smile,tell her str8 off,or what?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Glory Road...if u wanna see a man cry
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Oh my goodness, where to start???
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> because some girls may not like your personality but still may want to keep u
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> In this web cam chatting innocently.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Do you ever see him eyeing other men?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> i think u guys should some what spice your marriage.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> just stay calm about it and hopefully everything will go smoothly.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> guys dont do well with feelings because of testosterone its that simpel
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> :) No need to boast about your annual income.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> trust me it works, for me it did anyways.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> All I can say is YUCK!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Summer definetly, it's hot, I love doing things outdoors and it's beach weather.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> I previously entered the question about the advice i needed about the guy i like.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I don't do anything for sex.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Most men only care about one thing and one thing only .. getting sex.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> he is obviously happy if he is with another girl.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> in this day and age just ask him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> when u always think of that somebody.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Hi Friend, I hope you are having a great day.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> like u addicted to something, he/she can't get out of your mind.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> they want to be taken care of!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> just listen ur heart when u r in love.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> it is probably because you are a mean...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> then if he dont, then he dont wont u
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> She will be excited that you actually got her something different and unique :)   :) Ms.Orchid
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> men don't have a g spot only women do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> to love somebody that when you see them, you lose your breath?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> females push them to it  all the time
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> TRY A SLOW DANCE IF YOU WANT HIS MEAT... OR TRY ASKING HIM WHAT HE WANTS...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> its normal.... but make sure you dont take it too far, and try not to obsess about the argument!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> If she did #2...keep at it!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> sometimes i work out before sex and it's actually better.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> and tell her if she needs a sausage .
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> when she arrived, i jumped out of it, lol
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> Oh no its not uncomfortable at all...its really quite nice...hits the g-spot...its good
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> if he does not answer, come to me i'll love you forever.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> i saw 'him' hiding from me... ouch...*cries*
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> age is just a number....anything is possible
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> if you really care for your bestfriend, just set him free.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Unless the doctor specifically tells her not to have sex...it is totally safe all the way up to delivery.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> or what ever else you feel.sex is a bueatiful thing so be sure to enjoy it.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> just take care,,,invite for coffee...slowly ask her phone no..she will judge u then...everything will be fin..
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_40> DON'T say its not you it's me!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_30> u will find out soon enough i promise
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_40> sex is only max 30 min a day.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> here chew an apple and make out with me, i like the pulp.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> then make plans to have fun with friends without him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> if u really like that guy and he likes u too and the feelings are mutual.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> 1.i'm 88% sure that i started a temporal distortion for  four hours,...in one of my experiments...!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> ?..just curious.. i mean..skinney but a round butt..just some back
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> well lets see if you were a guy and you weren't gay,wouldn;t you be mad bc women didn't exist?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> Ummmm....why did you ask this here?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> If she doesn't respond then you just have to find another girl.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> i bought for my bf and i. and barely even stay there sold after a couple of months
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> some do, some dont its all in how they were raised
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> talk louder an appear not to notice the guy
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> have the guts to go up and talk to her
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> young girls can be fun and energetic.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Not letting the age difference get in the way of love!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> Well Im tired of repeating myself over and over, I feel like Im wasting my breath.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> use good manners but don't be afraid to be honest.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Sully gave u the best answer... she is totally right.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> So get the heads up on this before that other guy does!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> maybe when you learn how to spell virginity...
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_25> me too but i aint picky like you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> If she wants to get married that bad then I guess, you guys are not made for each other.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> the last place you should be picking your nose is during sex
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> warm soap and water.......oh i'm sorry i thought you said an odor of protection.....
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_25> i think you should tell her what you feel!!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> Especially if you feel you couldn't trust him no matter what.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> I cant understand, if you want a chat mate does it matter if he/she is hot or not?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> there is only one solution forget what's going coz its not ur fault u r right in ur place.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> Nah, it doesn't nescessarily mean so.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> Why don't you give it a try?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> when your talking about normale stuff just say it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> why would you ask us that w/o telling us whats going on?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I did it with one of my best girl friends.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Y r u stressing yourself that much?!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> But make sure she doesn't know it's u.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_30> but is 21 and up too young you think?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> make sure your on the pill then if you try both out you wont wonder who the father is
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> she didnt have a friend in the world.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> Oh, remember, do it in person, not on the phone, it is much nicer that way.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> But again, don't worry about it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> ...baby dont hurt me, dont hurt me... no more.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> put his flick on the internet, and say that he is avavailible 2 suck dick with his phone#
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> when i talk to him on the phone my voice cracks.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> ask yourself whatcha gonna do, and what you want.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> First off, if you are, stop listening to Pink Floyd, they are probably not going to help.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i am using my boyfriends computer
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> This sounds like my sister and her now husband.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> after all the punishment should fit the crime!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_65> bcuz u did not tell him?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> i was with her like 24/7 and she just wants her space right now.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> you will know if he is the guy for you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> He will say I look sexy, But he had a hard time getting use to say it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> Don't listen to anyone else tell you what to do.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> y'all either got the wrong ones or the                                 right ones.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Not sure if it is the same everywhere.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> i might be in love...i dont want to blow it!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> ), and full name and possible aliases at the courthouse, though.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> the way he acts with you in public vs the way he use to act.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_5> TALK WITH EACHOTHER MAYBE ALL YOU NEED IS COMMUNICATION
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> u have to have trust or you have nothing
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> !YESSS YOU DID IT AND ANSWERED SO MANY PEOPLES QUESTIONS.. YOU MUST BE A GOOD FRIEND..
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> Give him a love tap on the arm and giggle while asking why he didn't call.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> So all you've gotta do is realize that, get out there and be the awesome person you are!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> no because then we all wouldnt be here
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> if you swing to the left with a gay partner you be waiting a long time, :)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> hes got you waiting like a puppy on a lease .
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> (for now)  he's just so beautiful....
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> he is love , peace etc.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_95> No, theres no way to tell.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Ask him out, or let him ask her out
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> Take her to a funny movie and just be there for her

<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Women: Make love to your man, ask about him often, etc.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> sure there are plenty of them!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> but dating should be a stage where you are more than friends and less than lovers.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> Ask him what he wants & do it for him!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> it safe but everyone works hard and goes to bed.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> Ask him/her and get married on a special day which you 2 like.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> Unless he cheated or did something like that then BE MAD!!!

<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> i think personality because iam funny outgoing caring person
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> Why whas wrong with wanting a women over 35?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> if you really like the guy, you would want him to be happy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> you could prolly stand to STOP HAVING SEX WITH YOUR BEST FRIENDS BOYFRIENDS!
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_25> So much drama......dump that whole bag and go after a new circle of friends.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Three years is a looong time and he needs to suck up and face it like a man!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> You can, but you gotta work for it, you know i'm sayin' ?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> looks, age, personality, compatability, income .... in that order.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> Me and my guy do things a bit different.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> if you think that he should then you do it for him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> You don't need to say it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> No matter how good she is, she is human...curiosity will get to her and she will look through them!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> his girlfriend even thinks we should go out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> try going to a gay club
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> Married 23 years and things are pretty bad.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> and that was it for the next 3 months.

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> go up to him grap is ham ham and ask him what he is doing 2night
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> i'm a guy, and i got cheated on once, and it hurt me a lot.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> If he stares at u a little longer than normal.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> pick one and be happy with the choice.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> im a guy but i hate those playful guys too.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> it does'nt real matter o me but somtimes it does.long it not to small
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> try to work out y he's not fufilling what u want instead of flaunting with the next man.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> I didn't think he'd ever go for me.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> any female from india wannabe my friend?????????
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_65> Only if youre interested of course.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> and yes this is a problem.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> Both had children from previous marriages (dad 4 and mom had one).
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> to nget married and find a place to stay fro a honeymoon?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> If the guy was in it foe sex, soon after he gets what he wants.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> i dont know, but i can tell you if you find the right one.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> Then he would say o definately.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> love vs hate and ignore the bible verses.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> Personally, I have a husband, women aren't my preference, so I can't help ya there, hon.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> yes, but is guilty love worth anything?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_10> IF HE WAS JUST LOOKING UP INTERNET PORN I WOULDNT BE SCARED.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> (some girls mix sexual feelings for love)
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> maybe he saw you eating a cock roach off the floor
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> At least, it sounds like she told you about it and didn't try to hide it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> if your a boy your dick will get hard, if your a girl you will leak...  :lol:
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> she should be able to take it.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> I just can't put my finger on it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> JUST GO TO BEST BUY OR YOUR LOCAL COMPUTER STORE AND THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO HOOK YOU UP.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Yeah- he'd prob' dump me b/c I might make his dicision too hard for him to keep.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> and you feel the same for him.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> sure  i mean what makes the difference its worth it in the end.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> A lot of girls out there want a guy that will care about them like your guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just talk to him, that will help u a lot.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> like for me i focus more on the girls personality.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> One of my favorite gifts to my boyfriends back in the day was a basket of goodies.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Pampered....seems harmless enough unless they have mothering issues
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> And worms if you're a dog.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> If he watches too much t.v.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> (^^,)  choose someone who you think is worth of your love...
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> Never told him that you like him, people want thing that they can't have.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Well she is a b***h why didn't she break up with him in the first place
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> Why don't you ask him out?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> that's the way love and marriage work.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> if you have something in common to talk about that's a good start!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> If she decks you, you went too low too fast...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> 2ND OF ALL MAKE SURE ITS SUPER ROMATIC.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> You only find the 'perfect' guy once in a million--if you're lucky!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> Because You want to be around her...and shes Not there...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> IF HE IS YOUR HUSBAND THAN HE SHOULD BE SPENDING HIS SPARE TIME WITH YOU OR GUY FRIENDS.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> best of luck ... you will definitely need it.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> If it's your older sister- mind your own (d)amn business!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> if he dont really pay attrention to u and is always flirtin around with other girls.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_45> that's the only way to help you get over anybody.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> if you should do it if you don't stay with him!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> why should it matter what color someone is...I thought it was always important, if the person treated you right!!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Its called a *buzz*...its called lingerie...its called a lot of things, but when you cheat...you get called a whore...
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> but i am not a bad person i didnt go and brake up a home.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> She asked about the flowers and I just said.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> to me i think hes confused.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> Some guys like to drive on straight roads.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> I think he's playing games with me !
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> Put all your love into the one that needs you the most right now.......YOUR BABY!!!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> i was mad bcuz it was goin sooooooooo good.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> just go for a tiny bit more each time.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_25> if you are just having fun and not willing to commit for the long run... sex
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> cause i'm in need 4 a boy friend
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_50> - Well, where is he now then.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> hey if you and the girl you find are cool with it,why not?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> There are two guys that like me.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> How do you know what type of person it is and what you'll be getting yourself into?
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> some things, once done, cannot be undone.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_10> IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT YOUR JOB I GUESS IT DOESNT MATTER
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> You do want her to come to you if he's pushing her too far don't you?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> If that's so, then move on.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> you lose if you bite their bate.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> I always believed in THE MORE THE BETTER.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> I WOULD FAINT, THEN I WOULD LEAVE THE HOUSE.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> no its all about the way you work it
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> every one of us has a destined person
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Really though your better than that!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> if you are looking for a girl thats not shallow mabey you shouldn't be shallow.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> i dunno wat else to say...it weird asking complete stranger this...but oh well
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> & make something true outta all of this?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> tell her that with a calm straight face.)
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> (and by the way it is more normal than what you think.)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> If he doesn't start acting like the way he used to then maybe its time to move on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> yes, im sorry to say but this is just a teaser.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> mabey because you are doing something he does not like
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Now I don't know what to do.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> just be responsible, show her that you care, and talk with sense!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> I DON'T KNOW MAKE UP A GOOD ONE.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_45> If you don't, then I would dump her.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> no it's just eye candy if you just enjoy watching pornography of 2 girls.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> If there's a girl you want, but she's in a relationship... um...
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> or say something and wish you hadn't?
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_50> How should I even get a guy to be interested in me?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_50> Do u have any ideas pls?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> sounds like it, just too shy to talk to you if you like him approach him and talk
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> If he liked her I don't think it would be a problem.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> I'll tell you, what's her number?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Use feathers or fingertips and just lightly caress each other all over (except...you know...).
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Tell him that its just not working between you 2 and part ways.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> sorry mama,bt ur question is vague..
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> try another guy....(i HATE age diffrence.)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> u jsut starts showing full confidence and trust on him.the thing will come to normal
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> relax its fine, nobody cares as much as you do.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Suck it up and say something.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> If someone can't look past another person's looks...it's time to move on.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> why don't you have sex with him?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Say it was nice meeting you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> If he has kids get out get out.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> poor u i wish your answer is no
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> good luck and stay away from him
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> He says he wants to leave her and she treats him so badly.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> after looking back you might find that you are not the one with the problem.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> i still feel like i need somone to hang out with.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> they pretend to be scared cuz its an easy out and women are sappy enough to buy into it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> What if you had gotten pregnant?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> I knew it wouldn't be easy to tell my dad, so I decided not to.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> Chances are you know some already, but you just do not know it.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> mall, movie, dinner at your place, bowling....
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> i understand that would be hard but being honest would help.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_45> does it matter, gay or not do you think you were going to hook up with him?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> !this gf and sister thing shouldn't even be a question!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> mixed females are just way too hot..
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Everytime id text him he'd start arguments and say i was the one always starting it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> I think it is cute to play around...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> no mature guy would date even 2 girls at a time, not to mention 5, its ridiculous.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> which one your ex-boyfriend is ?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> last time i was there he was drinking alcohol and he is only 15. i really need help!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> You MUST think about your baby now!!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_25> ofcourse he still loves u....it's just that he got mad at u!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> ONCE A CHEATER= ALWAYS A CHEATER...find someone new, and try looking somewhere else BESIDES the internet.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> i mean how old do u have to be to buy protection, do they card u?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> After all, they were only talking, you were kissing.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> trust....that is something that once lost is a bitch to gain back!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> He was on my friends list, he had two other women on his.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> I am the same age have U tried lieing or sneeking out.Works 4 me
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> Thats exactly what he wants you to do.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> this is just a question to thro out there.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Because no decent girl wants to be with a jerk.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> stay friends.If u did date him make him jealous.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> yes, but don't lose her she will be fine if u just love her
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> It ended up being one hell of a night for me!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Im so sorry she has not answered you properly!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> i admire you for still being a virgin.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> Well, does he really like the girl?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> I like this guy, but he has a girlfriend.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> Why did the blondes belly button hurt!!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> And I thought I had a tough one with quitting smoking... which didn't work by the way.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> it depends, what she means, if she means she likes you alot, then it's a compliment.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> But never lie about it to a girl (e.i.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> I like him but panic whenever Im around him.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> Baby: Baby weighs 1 pound 9 ounces (709 grams).
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> What he likes, what you like.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> but the reality is, lover can't be great friends.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> good girls are honest, they say what they think about without hurting other people's feelings.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> !and plus you can always get another girl friend!!
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> Im 31 and still get looks!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> If you want to cry,.... cry.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> you just have to lear to accept each others belifes, or lack there of.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Did you ever really care for her or was it just a physical thing.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> well u can act like u know them say u when to school with them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> if you have a mutual friend, have them tell him you are interested.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> When you get married it's a serous thing.
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_30> If you think it won't work, quit and get a new job.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> I won't be making out with every guy I see if I know it won't lead to anywhere.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> if he is thaen he has been there and done things.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> Plus, I wonder if he did even love you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> if you guys have a good friendship, you could probably let him in on your little secret.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> It depends, I didn't see if you were a he or a she.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> how do i get that website
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i find myself asking the same question about meeting a decent guy.....
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> some ppl like to try before they buy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> People put way too much emphisis on looks.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> just because the are not blood does not make them not family.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_45> if you think he is cheating on you, he probably is.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> i don't know but it will be ashame if he was.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> unless youre maried to the girl, your sister comes first.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> ...wish to share, am a returner favourer kinda person.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> spiel they have you do, and some guy responded with Your phone number.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> you are in love right, age is a number not a life style.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> if you stay on here.. possibly not anytime soon :D
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> I know I sound stupid but I need to know
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_30> I know, what a dork right?
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> I don't call it as moving on...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> by the way this has nothing to do with gender, men can be just as stubborn.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_40> But if you meant will I ever have an affair the answer is its up to you.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> girlkat, I think you like me.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> You just have to trust her.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> Must s u c k to be me.... : )~
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> its all good unless u drive a 1978 Ford F-100
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> but  , for om extent , an e friend may be helpful till u meet ur real 1 .
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_25> Why am I the victim here?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> well, that's where i come in.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_25> well i like the weird ones!like hes a sweetheart by all means.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Ask for money instead of gifts.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> well so was i and we are doing pretty good.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> I am not talking about my dad.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> It depends on what u talk about with the ex...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> it's a scam....I got that too....no such thing
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> You could keep it exclusive to close family and friends.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> it will just annoy him and piss him off even more.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> But I am a big fan and I don't care about that.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> Are you a good guy and just want to talk?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Most of my friends are guys.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> Not to be disrespectful, but hell naw!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> I'M ONLY 21 AND I'VE BEEN WITH MY HUSBAND FOR FOUR YEARS AND I RECENTLY GOT NARRIED TO HIM.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> if he have a girlfriend already, n still wants u?
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_35> This CAN be FUN for BOTH of you!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> it looks like u r a ncie guy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> if the girl really loves you, she wil reconcile with you n give you another chance.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> What is it; not having sex?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> would u if u had the chance?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> there are so many pregnant women who feel that way.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> it must be that the dude treated her really bad.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> take ur time and study her
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Cheer up & have some fun!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> And above all like Will Smith says go 90% and let her come 10
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> (by the way, r u crazy)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> it is not you talking it is all hormonal talking.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> dont use sex n your body for having fun !
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> hay i thinks its relly kool their looking at boobs their looking at i think its a complientt
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> to protect them from getting hurt
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> you're just going to get labeled a possesive bastard who can rot.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> does she even know anything about him?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> It's like this... YOU DONT LOVE ANY OF THEM!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> He says that im the right girl but hes to young.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_60> If you love him and he feels the same then what does it matter how other people feel?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> cross him out of my life or continue going over to his house since i'm friends with his sister.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> I think you need to ask yourself some pretty tough questions like...Can I live with this?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Before him I was only dating guys in their 40's, 'casue I wanted someone mature.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> Best of luck to you, Keep it real
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> maybe you should think what is missing in your relationship and make it work that way !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> There's a guy who's 31 who I've hung out with.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> my husband never cared what i had to say even in the beginning.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Should i leave her alone so she wont get yelled by her mom everyday because of me?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> email me and i'll let you know how big i'd like it to be!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> no guy is romantci tillyou mack him
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> NOT ONLY AM I BEAUTIFUL BUT I AM PHEONOMINAL.GET AT ME.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> you feel it like its right and you alwayz want 2 be around this person
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> It dont mean she des love u but she mite have a crush on you
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> the roles are so backwards these days!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> what would a 22 year old man think about dating a 25 year old women?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> OK, Let me get this straight up front.... Guys are often clueless about subtle hints.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_55> im so not into picking someone up at a bar.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> u need to talk to your dad about this be open tell him how u feel.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> because women are women ... very annoying
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_35> Just hang out, make some guy friends and girl friends and hang.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_50> well its because they are desprate to jump into things
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> I don't think so, if your in love your in love.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> bcuz u like that someone enough to date them and u have tons of fun.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> i'm a good looking guy and i have no problem meeting people and i love to have fun.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> now cheat on him, it will feel so sweet!, then dump the chump and move on
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> yo your are mad kool in my book
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> Always no matter what be yourself and if thats not good enough the guy is trash
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> A friend ship is a big thing so don't brake that....
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_35> I love her to deathand before her i never dated a girl... ive messed around but never dated one.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> So why waste your time.You are woman and there's lots of fish in the sea.
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_25> like some people always say... once a cheater, always a cheater... i hope this helps... take care of yourself!<3
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> theres more pain in your life than good n happiness
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_25> divores him he is a jerk
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> girls love a guy who smells good dude
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> 18 or older  and it has to be w/ someone who's also 18 yrs or older
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> i guess i should have said that it's too young, unless you're not worried about divorce.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> if you don't feel so sure about him or you are not comfortable, then dump him
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_25> i think you guys should wait.
<NbChars_240> <LevSim_20> Either you pick him up, or have him pick you up.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_30> Sweetheart means that you are a sweet person
<NbChars_210> <LevSim_25> Just say Can you do that for me, please?
<NbChars_260> <LevSim_30> when you married it was for richer or poorer.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> you shouldnt care what other people think.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> that happen to me in away & it took me awhile to get over it
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> I found my guy in the yahoo member directory and sent him an instant message.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Don't bother with the girls that lust after 'hot guys', they are shallow and immature.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> just be careful on all counts.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> (besides sex, guys) or girls who know what's worked for them?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> See how far she went with him...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> I mean do u like much talking?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Trying to ask for stuff on the net!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> How long would you date a guy before you would have sex with him?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> dear, it is all in your mind.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> I just thought of her as my friend and I still do.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> A mans guitar tells a lot more to me :-p
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> find urself someone else and mayb it will help.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Tell him he ain't got it like that.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> because honestly thats usually what it means.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> on why is he cheating .
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> It might be hard at first but guys come and go.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> what do you all like while haveing sex?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> make your decision and get back to me kid.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_10> SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE TALK'N ABOUT!!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> if u know the piano or any classical instruments they may like u!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> i dont know my big brother is so overprotective it sickens me
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> I guess my boyfriend (well now my ex) and friends decided to play a little joke on me.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> u know when his whole attitude change with u.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> You just tell her, flat out.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_40> Well im a kid (no offense to other kids) but great parenting.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> I'd say what but it wouldn't be opropriate
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> yes it is important to married couples!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> If you want to scream, ....scream.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Chicks can be reall Odd at times.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> its ok but talk to him
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> actually all man wants to have a girlfriend but somehow they don't know how to start the relationship.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> Even though I know its hard at times,  But there is always calm after the storm god bless
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> maybe seprate for a little while
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> It's not so bad, you don't know what your missing!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> You're her husband the other guy is just that another guy... What's so confusing about that!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> believe it or not women ask the same question about men.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> But be nice to her too.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> someone , who talks sweet + thinks sweet things , and + eat sweets = sweet heart
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> Basically, what I told her is that she should come right out and tell them.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Get out there and get comfortable doing every day things.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> And I have no idea on what to wear!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> your trying that hard to get a girl?????

<NbChars_200> <LevSim_30> If you get te answer please forward to me too!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> TALK TO HER ABOUT IT AND LET HER KNOW HOW U FEEL.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> u mean u want to keep two-timing, or should i say, five-timing all these 5 girls?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> yes i should it's ok for a female to ask a guy out
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> LOL, BTW, as u have guessed, she is jealous and wants u to be out of the race...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> So my answer to your question is: It beats me!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> and they are good lookin' just they way it hangs down.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> do not give up you will find him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Disney world, add some good fun to thier honeymoon!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> Coz they all love the bad boy.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> wow that doesn't sound to good..... but then again I don't know your girlfriend
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> What if you guys break up, then you have to see each other everyday.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> However, only do this if you guys are still on good terms.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Wait until the 10th grade then give him a call
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> depends on wat kind of person u are!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> not to hard ot figure out here
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> 2) u don't want to lose all of them?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> by the way, not doing it w/ you  does not really he's gay or something.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_15> IF A WOMAN OR A MAN LOVE EACH OTHER WHY CHEAT.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> her idd does though and will let her know
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> grab his butt guys love that
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> u can but you have to keep it professional.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> i think its for hygeinic reasons...but as they say it increases sensation, so there!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> since nobody else here knows what to tell you or even cares about you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> guys r horny, u just gotta show em some stuff
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_90> differs from one man to another

<NbChars_55> <LevSim_35> however much i hate 2-timers, i still wish u luck in finding ur true love one day.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> He cheated on you, so he was not meant to be your bf.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> no no no it's all wrong wrong
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Be yourself and dont fear getting close...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> no i havent but i really would like to try it.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_45> if hes good enough you'll have an o
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> no it's natural but if u don't do it it will be ok for u .
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> or the person u love doesn't see that u love her at all.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> this is most sad wrongly bad!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> when friends hook up it can turn nasty.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> I hope i did well :P
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> if you really are in love you will feel it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> TURNOFF- GIRLS THAT HANG ON ME AND DONT TRUST ME.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> i think that he like some one else
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_55> should i just let him go on his way to try mend the relationship with his ex or what?
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> but i wouldn't be anyone beyond her to judge her.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> like parents, we always fight with them but we still love them and they love us too!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> If you STILL can't get one, well...
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> its long because they have to see if its ture love or not.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> Your in bed with a girl and your worrying about leg hair?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> that's telling me he needs some sort of counciling.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> thay cant make out guys ....  thay dont know what is what
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> And don't let him lie to you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> lke phone sex from your cell to the hous.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> and its pointless to even try to understand.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> If you really love the guy, you shouldn't doubt esp.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> I do two boy cousins and one female.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> that doesnt mean hang out with band geeks.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> y would it be bad if u liked him?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> Ask yourself do you want this guy to be in your life no matter what?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> Well, without a huge club, you can't make anyone do (or feel) anything, but...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> ill take either one so long as they r so so so hot!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> I think we are both happy!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> nice arms, to feel that i am safe in them
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> tell them to stop be annoying.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> no it means your curious it ok
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> he starts deviating frm the topic and in the end i donno wats happening!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_15> BETTER TO HAVE PLENTY THAN NOT.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_60> im going to tell you in a straightforward way how to get everything you ever wanted.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> cute sexy girls could caccth any boy they are taking you for granted.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> um, don't start out possesive with anyone.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Wait til he gets back, then ask again.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> when you have true love and know that he/she are the one
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> When you have sex with her.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> I think you should always live in the moment.........enjoy...................
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> Make it her happiest day ever Mom!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> But ask him and see what he says.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> never ever talk to this girl again.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> any guys out there who know what they'd want?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> What, like I can't get that?!...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> just go up to the person that u like and grab her arms and kiss her!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> he may not be like the lasted guy as much as you think =)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> what if the relationship doing go well, you'd have to see that person everyday.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> And pleanty of Chemical X, if you want a freak in the bed.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> you're a good girl just by being you and not someone else.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> u will now u sould just ask him!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> go outside and meet real people.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> 16... but 21 is too young... mistake i wish i could take back
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> then you will find out yourself saying that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> ud just have to respect the fact that its his/her decision.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> don't do anything your not comfortable with and never comprimise yourself
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_45> If not, at least you won't have to carry that big, I wonder if... on your shoulders.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_45> all the way,its alot more fun and easier to get along with
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> be nice and lay on the charm.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> That means she's doing what you shouldn't.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> If ur really in love what is wrong wit that?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> just enjoy him the way you have been, gay or straight
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> women out with rude arrogant unemployed dirtbags.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> without this all there would be is silence.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> no seriously...love is unconditional....and a realo love brings out the best and the worst in u...
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> have a lil pride in urself
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> JUST TELL HIM THAT THINGS ARN'T WORKING AND WHY THEY ARN'T.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> no, i don't think it's a good idea.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> And I am sure his wife didn't like it!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> does this guy have a good job?does he have a temper-jealous-control you-get along with your family?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> Who cares what other people think???
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> it goes on and on forever.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> From the way I see it, there is no way for her to learn other than the hard way.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> dont ever think your not good enough.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> for me that love is just a physical attraction!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> u have to accept the fact that he/she is gay.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> Ok seriously you treat it like any other break up.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> Just say hey buddy, you know that I love you.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> If you have kdis thats means you like havin babys and maybe the guy wants kids to.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_10> GOOD LOOKS BUT IF YOU DONT HAVE A GOOD HEART BEHIND THE GOOD LOOKS THATS NOT GOOD EITHER
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> Send a pic, that one is not doing it for me...wait I'm latin...never mind....

<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> put it to her the best you can
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> you remind me of my sister.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> why dont you try on the dating line
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> walk her 2 the door hug her goodbye,then turn the hug in2 a kiss
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> tell her you want nothing to do with her
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I know it is bad, but I can't help myself.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> have you ever been left all alone.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> Ya should not marry if your not 100% sure.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Just make sure your dog isn't hungry!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> you like what you can't have .
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> They have good families, a great wife, etc.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Well it is not so hard, talk about things that you both have in common....
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> Exotic looking..  Plus the contrast is very sexy..
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> maybe snack a bit and get back to foreplay before doing it again.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_30> yes, it's always ok to be friend with somebody, even if they're your enemy.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> well it might just be maybe you need to find more in common with them
<NbChars_220> <LevSim_30> hi girl im in 7th grade too y u set him up?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> Finally someone from STL, a club
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> Never say ever, dont lose your hope.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> He's not dirty, just a clutterbug, drives me crazy!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> there is always a way .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> it doesn't matter if she got you a present.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> because boys are smarter than girls baby!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> talk to your sister about it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> A cheating man thinks with the wrong head....
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> try making it something you do together.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> make a date to truely be together for ever.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> Still, I doubt anyone takes them seriously, anyway.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> don't worry about what other ppl say...your not on this earth to please anybody but YOUR SELF!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> Man you can get a girl that loves u don't worry about it.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> Easy to fall in lust, hard to fall in love.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> Women are just as scared sometimes!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> I don't think it unreasonable to ask him to try, and see how it goes.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> well, because men do think !
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> this is sum men to men advise...tell her u like her dude!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> did they change in anyway other than you now knowing?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> the one thing i like on a woman's body is their eyes and feet.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> no if u like or loves him tell him and before that u have to know him
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> or are you just maybe thinking about kinda loving him?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> There ought to be a grace period though, so you don't look like you pick up leftovers.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_50> Ao treat the cause not the effect!
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> It was awful when wanted something I knew wouldn't work.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> You are young and you need to have fun.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> stand up and fight, forget about yourself and your moaning about.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> I hope you can get good result:)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> You should go win some money.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> He swept me right off my feet!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_35> really have no idea at all.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> Ya kind of gotta feel sorry for the guys in a way, being so dependent on us, poor things.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> just dont be tired of lookin'.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> i'm seperated and i really like this new guy, but he lives in florida, and i live in louisiana.

<NbChars_195> <LevSim_25> why can't i find her ?????
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> shouldnt the guy be doing that?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> if she says yes than good luck!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> of course it is, why wouldn't it be?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> (self love is -hair-fingernails-massage-exercise, you know the rest)  8~)y----Peace.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Not if you don't want to be.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> i knew it another good looking man turn gay what the fuk are women doing to men!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> Even if they don't admit it i'll say boobys
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> NEVER break up cuz youve been dating to long, that makes no sence!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> if they like you they wont care about looks dress nicely though just to invite them around the corner
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> i think its worth it !
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> just accpt it  he is family
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> if he likes you, ya wanna make him work for it.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_35> evergirls like no person but boyfriend!
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_40> You just have to be patient.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> If she's not interested she'll let you know and then at least you won't wonder anymore!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> SHE ISN'T WORTH GOING TO JAIL OVER.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_50> Wait a while before asking Ready now?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_40> everytime that i have a chance, is what I really like.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> but i dont know how to help you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> But this whole deal of once you go out with someone, you can't date anyone else is b*** S***!!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> no age dont matter and i think younger men like older women  good luck
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Send me a message on 360 :)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> one girl at once you don't need to rush anything.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> if yours does, though, have you consider soap and water?
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> Bad boys are hot...but they're not worth it.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> in times when people around are discouraging you.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> Go for it if it's wat u want!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> IF SO THEN I HAVE A SMALL ONE TOO!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> Actually only bad boys/men themselves think ALL woman want them.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_25> In a 1 yr time spand.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> You will just have to get used to it.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_30> tell him uhave new guy~guarenteed 2 work
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_35> Plus what if you got pregnant .
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> you get to think you are what they say.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_35> no but you make no sense.
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_35> depends actually being married yeah it is but if only casual sex nope
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> NO she is too dang young!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> Now, you have to have the right tone of voice - VERRRY SARCASTIC!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_50> And well love isn't about 5 just 1 and 1.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> love me for who i am?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> mixed girls are just BOOM ass fuck,when they are the have the ass the looks and the chust
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> So...How do you like your eggs in the morning?
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_30> ok lets go part by part.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I love him dearly and I dont want to lose him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> do u believe in love at first sight?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> sum of dem punk out n do exactly wat u say or ask!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> woman...without a doubt...Gods' gift to man.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_50> If your sex life is not good everything falls apart.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> yea even short girls can be hot as hell not just cute
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> And they want it in cash.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> just chill out  and do whatever u wanna do,be urself
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> If you dont its already over.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> b/c it's the bad boy image that attracts them, personally i go for the nice guy, but that's me..
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> its fun and not as messy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_55> But it depends on how well u handle it to give excitement
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Look, its all entirely individual and up to the couple involved!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> basically what everyone has said but to keep it simple how you react or another person reacts without speaking
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> i dont know why but they say gay guys have fine taste.
<NbChars_270> <LevSim_25> No guy likes a dumb woman.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> all you need is two things,  passion and love
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> theres still a little spark, but not so bright anymore.
<NbChars_205> <LevSim_35> fifty to sixty years you realy need to know if she snores
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_40> And also we see each other like every day, we don't know each other tho...hElP!
<NbChars_200> <LevSim_40> Im a girl and I lost my virginity at 15.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> this is just about 90 percent of all guys dreams  just ask or tell him..
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> And now I have another boyfriend, and he much sweeter and he would never do that to me!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> But he is getting married this month.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> guys get horny if you touch their body anywhere.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> just follow ur heart no matter what other people say.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> - that we could be more than friends.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_25> It is how you use it!!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_45> fuck guys fast...lol well idk i just thot that sounded funny..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> I don't know what you are talking about, but it does...
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> yeah am with the dude make the action kiss him when  his not looking
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> Whatever you do don't act like a stalker.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> Anyone who says you're not good looking, don't bother taking them seriously.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> what do you mean by good?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> u don't mind if u r being hurt by your love.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> lol j/j but what a waste of meat
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> i promise it works bcoz i had chkd svrl times on many girls in such cases.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> If its for the experience...by all means..tell her!
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_50> am not same girl he meet.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> WOW we probably have had one, we just didn't know about it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> no becouse thy might go back and do it agin its not worth it.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_15> There are other guys out there.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_40> Not because your scary per se.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> I f you haven't found someone, no big deal!!!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> Tell me what you think guy's and girl's.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> you should kno better than to let a real friend go
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_40> Because he is a guy and guys act stupid at times.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> sometimes you can't help who you love but never refer to yourself as crazy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> So u make her feel comfortable then she will like u.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> now, that's when you should call him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I know his profile for MySpace and i am friends with him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i've been waiting 20 years and will keep on, i know someday we will be together
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> it means that he really does fell something about you.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> to protect his damn pride i guess!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> till u get married u sinner!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> Also , dont restrict yourself to taking only what you find at work!!
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_50> i m guy, but i will help you.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> of course WOmen r Better Lover than men
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> But some are a lot bigger than that.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Hell they can't stand it, they need someone to hang around with.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> But dont let her think you dont love her when you really do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> accept the break up and move on, dont let him stay in your life!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> In my experience, guys don't really like that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> guys just need to learn that thats not all there is to a relationship.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> and after sex u must talk with her on any light matter.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> no never do that if you do that he might brake your heart agin
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> i had experience and it works.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> all i want is a fun, caring, carasmatic, spontanious girl that is also caring.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Oh you got one of those types.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> maybe they just don't feel comfortable accepting it, or they don't like it but are trying to be nice.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Is she not having sex with you enough because she doesn't really want to?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Just to bad they like skinny women!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> YEt I don't want to have regrets later?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> well, wen a man and a woman luv each other very much... hey wait a second!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> But you're still a kid, and you just haven't gained enough wisdom to make this sort of decision.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Ask Him if he likes you.i have liked the same guy 4 3 years too.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> you have to be self confident, it is not always your fault !!!!!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> because we have no need for bull**** drama
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> do the research youll be amazed
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_30> P.S: He's married, but he is sooooooo very hot!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_25> you could always look for another lesbian lover...i think that will solve both your problems buddy!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> yeah...15 is too young...i'm 16, a virgin and at this age i'm still not ready.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> do you put yourself first, or your mate?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Because their boyfriends don't want any hair in their mouths...
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_15> YOU NEVER KNOW IF YOU'LL FIND SOMEONE BETTER.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> I heard some guys like licking his armpits (eww..).
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> the best age 15 when u start to get to be a women
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I don't know why you were asking but I don't think your gonna get much response.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> First he wanted you to quit smoking, now he says when you trust him?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> he says that he still likes me but isn't ready for a relationship.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Ask em' if you think its worth the risk I hope I helped!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Talk 2 ur wife 4 sumtime then both of u go 2 sleep.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> but you will have to face some problems.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> If you don't like any more you can keep being her friend.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> what ever someone does to make you upset.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> oh girl, please let him go!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Fight tooth and nail for her!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> just 1 example :like havig an unplanned pregnancy.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I practically drooled whenever I saw him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Even if you never do it again...will she really be able to forgive and forget?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> ASK her what SHE WANTS - what SHE NEEDS in bed - ASK HER WHAT FEELS GOOD to HER!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> it seems to me u need sm1 to pass time with m .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> age would not matter would it?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> give it up and find sombody else.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Sure, i have been in virtual love a lot of times
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> That is where I think relationships are like though.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> That wouldn't be fair to you.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> u could have better woman!and besides  we are men.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I don't know what to do!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> Most confident people (women) walk with a little twist/switch...kinda funny.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> Go to the US get a wife,marry her and go back to your land...;)
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> girls ask that question every ten minutes.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> well earn enough money for the books and then go buy them and get ur butt to class...have fun
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> Give it some time to mature.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> they are sweetie pies b/c they want to have sex with u. might not be the situation.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> If u never talk about it,how can you expect them to now your true feelings???
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> Almost all of my friends are guys.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> Best thing to do is just ask her and then you'll know for sure.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> I'm gonna go with a no.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> if htat's the biggest problem you have to overcome in this relationship, i expect a wedding invitation soon!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> yell at him/her and say get away from my cuz
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> i would say full lips and nice teeth(smile)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> you just have to trust her.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> just jump him, he'll know you want him
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> why do girls get played by boys?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Fore play is great and romance is awsome!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If you want 20 or more in an hour gimme a call!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_85> I take everyone seriously, plus thats what Heels are for...!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> On average I say 3 times a week...you do the math.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> stop search for it.it will come to you!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> how did you treat her when you were dating?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Just help me out a little please?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> It's not strange to have a 35 y/o virgin.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> If after, you need to let him go!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> i didnt know that you could have that problem!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> very good question waiting for answers
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> But is your girlfriend there to stay?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> you should be willing to give without receiving if you are serious with this girl
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Who says the girl can't give candy, flowers or little love notes?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> and say it to him very seriously without tears.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> every kiss is the first thats it.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> uhh dont get yur problem, he likes u, u like him  get married have kids, cool
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_35> Have fun, do not be fake, double date...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> wel, if its not too muck trouble, u should not do these things and see if he is dissapointed.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> If you have to ask, then he's not 'the one'.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> no i dont think that thats the answer but it dont hurt to flert
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> you'll never know if you dont ask!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> as in a penis entering a vagina, butt, or mouth...penetration...making love...fcuking...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> because if she is then just ask her when you 2 r alone.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_55> mmm... yummy.. i prefer to be their friends first
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> If you mean having a boyfriend like hanging out at each others house then middle school/ jr high.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_20> I feel so uncomfortable around her now.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> if your coworker is your boss or supervisor or your supervisee, it would not look so good to others.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> if he dont love her for who she is, the let him get the stepping.
<NbChars_235> <LevSim_30> theres plenty of time for men later!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_30> He's my #1 and I want him sooooooo bad!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> I'm not beautifuf but I am beautiful, sexy, smart and hung like a swollen firehose
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> then look for someone to marry.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_15> maybe on that very last room, you'd find her.. (^_^)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> flirting is the best sport ever
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> 3) if you still have a conscience, break up with all of them, admitting n apologizing for your mistake.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Women have to step up and start asking guys out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> He should be out of your life!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_90> The older you get the less diff this makes!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> even though ya'll started the relationship off of deception.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> we email, can talk on phone, hes very afraid of getting hurt again.altho ive reasssured him......
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> theres nothing wrong with ex's being just friends.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> If they steal they are a theif.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> you have to earn her trust back.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_10> MAKE SURE THAT THE PERSON IS GAY BEFORE YOU THINK OF SAYING ANYTHING STUPID.
<NbChars_45> <LevSim_25> tell police or ur parents immediatly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> 1 girlfriend and 4 girls that are friends is a pretty good deal too.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> Then what is a guy that drives a mustang GT?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> don't let go for you could never find it again.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> It means I'm going to get a heart attack in 5 minutes!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> that way when you are done, all of your love energy is gone.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> I NEED HELP, IT'S BEEN FOUR MONTHS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> (Please don't misunderstand...I am still presentable just not child-like) :)
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> ok. i see your problem you know it is your fault for dating all of them?!
<NbChars_215> <LevSim_30> This isn't fair to a guy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Then that friend can tell him/her how good u r in bed.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> No way not in that situation......my advice is to go on with your life and find someone closer.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> Best of luck and God Bless!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> im in an interracial marriage and am very happy.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> My 2 best friends are guys.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_20> Sense of humor it a turn on though, but physical, I'm a Breast man,
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_25> 4 example in ur anniversaries is sex needed in celebrating it?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> it will kill u. :D. i dont mean to offense.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> SORRY TO BREAK IT TO YOU.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> no i think it depends on her personality and of they are easy
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> HOWEVER - GOD created us and we're all Beautiful, Pretty, and the like:).
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> eharmony is expensive but very good.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> i belive that one should at least try it once incase the sex dont happen on wedding night .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If he hasnt left her yet, hes not going to anytime soon.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> you could just be freinds thoogh
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> My wife of 7 years just cheated on me.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Quit and get a less succesful guy
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> hay i have 14 years   form egypt my e-mail senchi_muto@hotmail.com if u want to chat
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> I am ready for u ;)
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> i dont believe in a best age to get married i believe its when your ready as a couple.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i don't see where you think a problem exists.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> They think in their pants, not in their brain
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Besides who wants to play a girl when her bestfrinds can kick his ass.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> I want to be that Guy!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> yeah i've seen times like these.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> dude, you do sound like that sex type thing from stp.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> well ask yourself...  would you rather say nothing and wish you had?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> So is it okay for me and him to be friends?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> IT COULD BE THAT SHE'S TIRED IF SHE JUST HAD THE BABY.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Tell her that you are sorry that you werent meeting her needs (inside ur heart u probably are).
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> I gave everything I had to him.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_40> *do you or him have to move out of the house?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> but sure i can b beautiful for u.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_50> you can met another lesbian online, but i'm not sure where else- sorry
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> a. right the good and bad sides of both and compare.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> i think it has sexual content
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> yes that means he luvs u cuz mabey sometimes u don't always agree on everything.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> i'll get to the point; i want a husband and a child.
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_40> He did wrong and couldn't face it.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_15> YOU NEVER HEARD THE SAYING YOU ARE WHAT YOU DRIVE?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_90> But if your always annoying this person just leave it alone.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Is the age difference gonna be a problem?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Some men would kill for that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Of course chubby guys can get dates!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> Do i just listen to her?
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> (seriously) If you don't already think you know who the girl of your dreams is then stop looking.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> If you start something out as a lie then he/she is not really interested in you anyway!
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> and remember birds of a feather flock together.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> if he is then he will think more about ur looks,hair,ect.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> maybe she feels bad about something?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> oral sex while on the road
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> the age difference between both of us is not much.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> We hate it when men do that to us
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> you should be honest w/ her.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_65> she is trying to tell u that she dosnt wont to dump u but she dosent like u
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Beleive me, MEN can take it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> Hope that helps, and good luck because you are always the most important person first in your life!!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Sometimes, fireworks go off and there is no happy ever after.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> You haven't met the RIGHT man yet!!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> then we r still gonna be fresh for them!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> when i try to console him he starts arguing and he doesnt let me talk.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> I dont understand guys one minute there making out with u n the next there like eww get away?!?!?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> A girlfriend of mine is lesbian and she wants to have sex with me .
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> Nice girls do want nice guys.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> since he cheated on you, i would say not to go out with him again.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> But im into the badboys Like we party a lot but its fun.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> some people have problems with this cause of problems they have inside!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_25> b/c u poop out of it DUH
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> If u also like him then just open up and take him in your stride.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_30> Just make a wise choice there are so many dumb people out there.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> You gotta try before you buy.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_30> the four c's and u will make it if u both feel, and share these!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> mail me i ll tell u exact answer....
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> thanks for the ride baby, now get your stuff and get to stepping!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Well, it's kinda creepy and the guy will feel awkward.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> yes, for your emotional well being, let this sleeze ball go, you can do sooo much better!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> These days who do we have?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_65> just grab his attention and dont let go!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> I'm starting to get that vibe - you know the one I'm talking about?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> Or just to 'get it off your chest'?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> I am not afraid to, but, im 34 years old, so, i really have nothing to loose.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_45> if he is cheating already then he will cheat on you also.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> that should work it worked for me!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> So dont try too hard, cuz you will only draw a blank.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> if he  doesn't say thanks, forget him, he's a jerk.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> But everyone keeps talking noise about how he look gay was stuff.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Ft. Bragg is right down the road!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> wow, that girl has issues, if she cant accept that you love your sister.
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_40> Not at all... its human nature.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> did it make you a better person?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> depends on their pesonality, and what they look like, not to mention their voice.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> only if I get something in return.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> Maybe the reason you realized you like him is because you just like seeing him happy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> do you have to be somewhere else that quick?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> If somebody said that to me I'd be insulted.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_60> i think u got wat i mean.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Okay I'll admit it......I want and need the points.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> You love your sister in a brotherly way...if you want her that bad.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> The problem is that I have the same question as you do!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> if we didnt count our ages we wouldnt worry.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> I say black mail would be awesome.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_55> jokeeee  Just be sure ur single.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> Totally depends on the Woman and where they actually are!!!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_40> as long as ur both single and have open feelings for one another.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> You just have to let her know your trust worthy.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> u need to show me ur pic first.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> ya'll should date it seems like ya'll like eachother alot give it a shot
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> u'r wearing the same hat as me.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> shes in high school wondering the same thing.
<NbChars_175> <LevSim_40> Why would a girl seem to be really into a guy?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> then we went out to luch like we always did.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> he is difrent but i would give him a chance.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> I have fantasies, it helps me get off, use it that way.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> think back to when you was dating.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> But marrying is not yet one of them.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_60> If you are a pervert, get lost!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_90> Should I say something, or just accept that not all guys are like this?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> i totally agree...if u r in love ur in love....DO IT !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_25> try to stay friends if possible.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> I'm sure, he's probably just busy.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> if so she is shallow .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> DONT DO ANY THING ASK ME TO DO EVERY THING    LOL
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_60> Start small - pizza or a movie.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Just a random question that i've been wondering about...
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> depends on who you're asking...  For me its bad when  1.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> he might b d cure after all
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_70> mr. know it all is dumb.. sex is bad when the person has a disease, use condoms.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_80> ask questions about him carry on coversation because silence causes probs.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> Do NOT try to lock him down and pretend that things are the way they used to be.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_65> love is something special n rare
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_55> Always take the good and forget the bad.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> if this dude has hinted that he wants to leave her but cant get out get out.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> my man a fireman i dont ask much he cleans and washes clos and he cooks
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> You just said them...you still love him.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> TURN ON - GIRLS THAT ARE INDEPENDANT AND TAKE WHAT THEY WANT.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> Oh yeah and when the moment finally does arrive don't go in the pool first.

<NbChars_135> <LevSim_25> plentyoffish.com is the best dating wesite
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_45> And It haunted her in High School.

<NbChars_140> <LevSim_60> show him a vidio of you having sex w/someone else
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_65> good girls are friendly and alittle bit shy (just a little bit)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Make it a fun game you can both play and you will both come out winners!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If your sister is just in the 6th grade then I think she's too little to date.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Then ask him if he fantasize some one else while doing you?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_80> Hes my ex bf and left me but want me again.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> i've been in love with the same guy for 3 years.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> I just don't have any good excuse.
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_50> they are for sex more than men are
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_40> Can you imagine teaming for a project at work with your EX?!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> may be your best friends is trying to test you.

<NbChars_140> <LevSim_70> in other words all these excuses are he doesnt like me, but just for play?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> I don't think it matters what you look like on the outside.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> and it's true that love is blind.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> when you ask her to be your fiance, that's the line
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> that's all I'm sayin'  ppl back me up on this 1 !!
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_35> And keep it up with some kind of regularity!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> if he doesnt respond well then so what, you can find someone else
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I dont live there, but i need to know what that area looks like.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> Yet I don't want to lose what I have.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_45> just perfectly understanding each other and communicating... ofcourse good sex is the most important factor!!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> you should thank god for that!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_40> (if you push yourself on her you`ll most likely run her off.)
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_55> love is not blind....it sees but it doesnt mind....hehehe.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_35> but believe me once you have him .
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> she is the one you are dating not your sister.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> I'm really great friends with this guy.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_55> he might just get a kick out of being with an older woman.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> KEEP IN MIND NO ONE KNOWS THAT I AM GAY.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_30> it is time that will heal your hurt, be strong and its going to be ok!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_50> YOUR ANGER WILL LEAD NO WHERE...  Hope I was able to help you...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_80> So definitely don't drive yourself nuts man.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Specialy if you guys break up and go seperate ways.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> leave them alone go find someone single how bout' whats ment to be will be.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> my husbands told me to move on.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> My boyfriend(hubby now) was too shy to do it!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> sounds like heck of a mess.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> If you are looking for casual dating, Yahoo Personals are pretty good.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> you should be 18 or older
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> there is nothing else out there.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_40> nice to know im a girl
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> If you're a good guy, and she's still this way, then I don't know the answer.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_55> its time for you to move on and find a guy that deserves a person like you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> then set an appointment with him!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> You don't like the mess, or is it a churchie thing?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> Have you ever cheated on her ?
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> some say yes   some tell me just half way beautiful
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_10> LADY AS A HOMEGIRL WHICH YOU AND I KNOW.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> It was so hard to be just friend with him.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_45> just tell her are you feel.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> This is a dumb ass question.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> but i don't know him look him up on mapquest that may help.
<NbChars_385> <LevSim_25> Get over him and move on.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_50> Another 'line' could just be to say something like 'man, I feel like coffee.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_70> No really, no guy ever stopped talking to a girl because they didnt want coffee.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> Coz if you do then you wont be doing that to them...  End of story...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> Newer questions get more activity on Yahoo!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> : I am not a pessimist.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_20> be presentable as much as u can and don't get lazy
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_55> Okay, first things first:  Men do not pick up on signs.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> I know i feel like hell after a night of drinking tequila
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> Look, this girl is probably really insecure, or shes just totally messed up.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> I've had this friend for like 5 years and i have had feelings for him for awhile now.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_30> not only is it ok to date other races...but it is ok to marry and have children.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> Good luck and don't play around with this.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_85> If your not then don't try to make it happen it will turn out wrong.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> If ya gotta ask, you're a ho.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> Check out the clubs down at the Loop :)
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_60> same here but youre lucky at least your friends
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> call her now n tell her you love her!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> 4) if none of the girls decide to give you a 2nd chance, accept it.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> wat are u some sort of terrorist?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> Certainly don't go to a hooker.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> a nice kiss on the cheeks to say goodnite
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> If you arent like that, its your job to prove it:-)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_50> But I hope it helps some.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_25> at 25 weeks  its pretty early,,,they are not doing much...but they are moving some....u will feel this
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> He's just sweet and you want to have a back up!
<NbChars_165> <LevSim_35> he sounds like a jerk so get rid of him for good!
<NbChars_195> <LevSim_25> Coz he can and you let him do it... WHY?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> what age , how long into a realationship
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> Flirt, go on dates, hold hands...
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> their body,a man always checks a woman body first and the rest comes later
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> if you dont know then you should figure it out elsewhere
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> but remember dont sneck out or lie that makes everything worst got it.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> THE BEST THING FOR YOU TO DO IS TO TELL HIM UPFRONT.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_85> but seriously, how can i check my girl is virgin?
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> it varies depending on the man, some are legs guys, some are breasts guys, some are booty guys...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> what do you mean if isnt that the way it works???
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> do you need something from him?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_70> u have to do foreplay it's must.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_55> dress for the occasion and just go with the flow.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> Of course, if you are like Socrates, you can get the best of both camps…
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> (I know this will be hard) BE objective.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> if u really love him, you'll need to deal with it(although hard.)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> He makes me happy and he makes me miserable!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> Guys are easy to figure out.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> anyway, it's none of their business.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_35> Can you go to a club or where ever and get numbers?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_5> HONEY , YOU NEED SOME SERIOUS A.A.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Here are some tips to pick up a guy that are nearly guaranteed to work:  1.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> As far as I can tell...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> !if yes!then u have nothin 2 worry about.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> My daughter is in 8th grade and she can't date.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_20> And boys don't get played by girls?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> ask her if she is married.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_30> lol  pray to God .. in the bed .. you will get a baby   hahahahah
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_55> just tell her it wrong and that u noticed that the preps don't like her.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> because girls have diffrent feelings for boys.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> what is your favorite thing for your girl to do?
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_65> golly jee whiz i hope you don't mean incest.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_15> I LOVE YOU AND WOULDN'T WANT NOTHING BAD HAPPENING TO YOU.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> and dont try to have sex with her.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> If ya give him what he wants then he'll be done with you before ya even noticed.good luck!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> all the more reason i dont fall into any kind of relationship at work
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> what can he do about it without taking any medication??
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Just pick the one you l8ike best!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> Do whatever she wants - whether you like it or not.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Wonder now why it's hard for some men to trust women....
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> you wouldn't buy a car without first taking it for a test drive, would you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> if you feel so bad, maybe it was the wrong choice??
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Needs to like cooking, even if she can't cook.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> make it confusing as hell for her so she figures out what we go through!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> CAN SOMEONE HELP ME HERE I BEEN ALONE LIKE 6 YEAR'S IT REALLY FUCKING SUCKS TO LIVE ALONE HERE.?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> cause im not willing without it and my boyfriend knos it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Problem is, she has a girlfriend and she's really kind so, I wouldn't try.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> How do u know hes the right one?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> You quit staying online so long.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> but i have been on it and then some and i find that reality is the best.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> Sometimes but I like it romantically too...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> !Good Luck in what ever decision you make...
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_85> if you do it together then it might not be a scary.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> other than the other ladies here i say it matters
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_35> I do not hang out with rude people or liars.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_25> Hope i'm that cool when i'm old!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> Take care, have fun and be happy.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_25> No, he actually hates you now.
<NbChars_250> <LevSim_30> If you don't like him, leave!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_15> IF ANYONE CAN HELP ME THAT WOULD BE VERY NICE IF SOMEONE CAN HELP ME HERE?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> The most importand thing is that u have one right name on ur list, 100% right.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_15> HMM 15 -17 PROBABLY IF UVE BEEN WIT THE GUY FOR 2 WEEKS OR SOO OR MAYBE 1 WEEK
<NbChars_225> <LevSim_40> i wish i knew cuz i feel the same way
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_15> With friends like that, you sure don't need enemies!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> Hate myself for that but maybe if the guy she went with was actually worth her...
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_25> i knew who the right ones was because.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_55> no, it all depends on how close you are to this person.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_60> a sadist loves pain, a masicist loves to give pain
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_15> ASK HER WHY SHE DOESN'T HAVE SEX LIKE THAT WITH YOU.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> If that reflects your age...let the fries go, and keep the shake!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if your younger it could be that, protectiveness
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_20> Is it really a big deal or something?
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_50> never been to florida, but try mapquest or a directory
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> If he doesnt want to break up then give him an ultimatum.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> take the words beginning from word 6 .. ull know
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> just do what your heart wants...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> yeah, some people including myself use it as motivation
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> I feel like i'm ready for love.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> no i wouldn't  except it      thats sick
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> i also believe in waiting til you're married so you end up with someone special.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_15> NEVER LEAVE A SITUATION EMPTY HANDED MAKE SURE IF YOU HAVE ROOM THEN BRING IT
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_30> why must you dragged a lie out any further.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> i would never have sex with some body i don't love.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> if you want to make someone love you then simply telling them that you like them won't do shi!t.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> and, why is it the best?
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_45> too late if he fell for the person u set him up
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> i don't want this new guy to be a rebound guy, b/c i really like him.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_35> thats about all i will post here,sorry
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_35> kiss her like its all you ever want to do because your love for her runs so deep.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_40> Do things that make you happy and feel good inside.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_40> Ask him if he wants to get coffee or something.
<NbChars_230> <LevSim_35> he will wonder what else is out there .
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> Baby, you're my one and only, etc.).
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> You should feel ashamed and dirty!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> some ppl say im sexy and others just say im hott.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_20> or other wise GET OVER IT!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_70> yelling, screaming, name game, blaming is nothing when it comes to emotional abuse.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_45> Its fun, it feels good, why stop something you're having too much fun doing???
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_55> totally depends on the girls whether you deserve a 2nd chance.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> U will know very soon how interesting these married men r!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_60> if you are in a relationship with him then seem sad or something and he asks whats that matter?
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> don't break up another couple so you can have a girl.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> It is for my daughter if I ever have one!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> For some guys, kids not their own is a bad thing, others don't mind.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> oh my goodness this is so happening to me, right now.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_25> LOOK just come out with IF YOU DON'T ASK YOU DON'T GET
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> only you and eric know that.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> YOU NEED TO TURN NOW TO ANY TYPE OF SUPPORT SYSTEM THAT YOU HAVE AND SEEK PROFESSIONAL COUNSELING NOW.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> if you've got the money, hell yeah, get it over with and good for you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> Why don't U just get out of the house and meet someone.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> If he loved you he wouldn't play a joke on you like that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> my friend tommi she loves her b/f.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> write me and i'll email a photo.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> live, love and be happy...and yea, have more kids (,)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> let him/her get fed-up of annoying you while you just think as if nothing exist.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> I think you ruined a good thing.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> now i dont know if that is true or not.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_100> where does the passion go after marriage?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> Like you're going to get it!
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_20> Flirting with other women is not one of them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_85> but if that fails annoy them to the point that they dont want to annoy you anymore
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> Perhaps YOU could call and ask him what's up?
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> you could of told me in person... jeez!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Hey isn’t that what we all want a friend that we are in love with.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_55> go 4 it your in love and u wanna b with this person forever
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_40> Well if I was u I would had said F***K You and go ahead with my buniness.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_65> (that goes for men and women)
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> Girl this is something that I want you to remember...  Guys would LIE no matter what you do... Why?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> if you want my help we need to speak privately because it's just too dangerous.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> woul'd that make the shallow coat like shield go away?
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_40> yes SEX is very important in marrage
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> If not she is just a girlfriend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> it's a chemical reaction :) and sometimes more than that...
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_60> Im pretty sure they do if its not an absurd amount (5?)
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> beacuse they are afraid that they mayn't fullfill their commitment since they have so many burden i.e family,office,girlfriend,friends etc.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_45> Just be careful though cos the other person might take it the wrong way and leave!
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_40> one unless you are a jack-ass
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> In my experience, NO...I wasted two more years of my life trying to stay married.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_55> i can't say i have done it before but know people who did.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> u have to touch it really gently.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> u could do it in the shower.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_80> just tell him that you really like him ... as a friend.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> say hey,_______ i was just wondering what u think of me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> i say DON`T GO FOR HIM!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_30> she hated giving head, she said it hurt her jaw.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> Try a few different things & see what works for the two of you!
<NbChars_265> <LevSim_25> If you rush into it, it's just not as nice.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> (don't forget to be romantic and suave!)
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_30> and it depends if theyre really goth (satan worshipping) or if theyre just posers and like the style.
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_25> Yes if it says and/or on the title!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_30> Give him a chance because he is a different person.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_35> As long as it's fully covered when u wear your hat you should be ok... ;)
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> wtf...i agree wit old man n just me...if he is only lookin lol... den dats not sexual abuse!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_35> your kids are going to look great
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_50> take it from someone who has made that mistake already!!!!!!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> i guess that it's my responsiblity once again.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> no but i would with someone elses grandma!!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> Oh well, atleast they answered correctly!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> body language is sayin or expressing ur felling thru ur body movemnt instead of using ur mouth.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> as long as you've got a good personality your alright.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_25> but it all happen when he/she confused whethr he loves u or not.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_75> if its love whats to think about?
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> me i have 6 dogs i play for the lackland lightnings
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> she did to me what we are going to do to your fella.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_70> because that is how life is.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> Or, if you can't do that, return the gifts and do not accept any more.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> Worry less about her, and more about you.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_20> so please help me out idont know whattod
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> I guess if you die....it was too much.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> You might be a 'full steam ahead!'
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_60> but if he says no fast without thinking that means he just wants to be friends
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_35> you need to go over and talk to them
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_70> Tell her or send her roses¡¡¡
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_40> the problem is i dont want to lost all of them!
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> Men cheat because women lie and make altimatums.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> so u start sendin mixed messages too!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_55> if you're not with her, then don't worry- chances are you think it's love but it's not.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> So I started beating her @$$!
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_45> dont u think he will want somebody else when u will become his gf?
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_95> Think about that and you will realize you made the right choice.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> that's the best thing to do.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_85> No, this is not true for everyone!!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> sometimes there are happy ending and then again not.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> love is the best feeling yet sucks if it wasn't meant for you!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> you cant get over someone that you still spend time with.
<NbChars_155> <LevSim_55> don't think about it, just do it!
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_10> CHECK FROM WHERE HE CALL LAST TIME
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_15> THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW FOR SURE IS TO BE TOLD BY THE PERSON THEMSELVES.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_35> when i asked her if this was good, she told me that she thinks so.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> YOu should be asking your self what kind of person are you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_20> Have breakfast of her when you wake up.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_80> ya,, he would walk out with toilet paper, doughnuts, everything but what he was sent in there for!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> nope...i would look for the cure first
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> yes anyone who says otherwise is just trying not to hurt someone's feelings
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_60> and u must know her sensitive points of her body.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> use your pretty little mouth, that is the only time my ex would ever really give me a bj.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_30> Its gross like some little girls thing.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> I wouldn't have married him right away, though.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_60> the guhs at my school love the blonde preppy bleh.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_30> marrige dont go by age as number you should know what marrige should be and why.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_45> i dont know did he i think that would be very disappointing
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_65> you giving her something shows that you were thinking about her which is good.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> the girl is a selfish brat lose her and find someone nice.
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_60> i guess it would have to be he would be more understanding.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> ya that would be a big NEGATIVE!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_65> same reason people don't like being held accountable for there own actions!
<NbChars_60> <LevSim_45> you need to read the questions that have already been answered here to get an idea what to do
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_55> lol  Good for you for sticking to your guns!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> If you are just friends then you will not worry about them becoming involved with someone else.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_35> Never, ever, ever sh1t where you eat...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> He says he wants to be with me, but why isn't he acting like it at all?
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_40> a girl made me this way.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_60> well, tell em, Let em know.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> you should talk to her about it
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_55> I think at the end it's not importand how many boyfriends u made to add to ur list.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_30> if yo u are in love it WILL be good.sex is bonus of love and marriage.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> take it easy and everything will fall in to place.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> I am currently going out w/ some1 that is y i ask
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_80> and you can trust your partner!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> think of all the bad qualitys of him and imagine him being bad too you
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> no you should set him strait and continue
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_60> we should do the cheating thingy!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> its hard sometimes being apart and seeing ur own!
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> if you really like the guy then do not break up just because other girls are jealous.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Don't go acting like all girls are like that: everyone has different personality.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_65> but it doesnt seem like you redally need that.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> I really liked him and knew the relationship would be over if I said no.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> The 5 love languages, Chapman Smart Love, Phil McGraw  after that it should be self explanitory.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> People always talk about lovers being great friends and what not.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Don't give your phone number and just say it was fun.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_70> but the only person i was the be with is my boyfriend and we have what we call trust.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> how they cross they legs, how they stand and walk.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_80> Disgusted with you, but hope you get your life on track!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_75> if u are sure about that it is so easy.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_35> before going out and just doing things like before.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_30> I really liked this guy too.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_25> yes i want to chat any ladies
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> If u don't know weather u r or not,then u r not.
<NbChars_145> <LevSim_35> Some guys want girl to talk dirty to them.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> not really, unless its way too big, then ouch!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_70> Same reasons why men do the same.r not serious.
<NbChars_190> <LevSim_50> I have w/ my granda, grandma don't smoke
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_85> but dont hang out with the wrong crowd.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_70> i think that everything foreign is interesting to me...
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_30> but honestly u could give it all you've got.
<NbChars_70> <LevSim_40> these are not so close boy and girl friends and meet only in college premises.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> You can't force her to like you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_90> if you ever decide to leave him it will probably nearly like him.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> i really want to help you.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Ladies think it is cute... Just DON'T do it in front of their co-workers or friends.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_75> well its the opposite of good lol
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> no but i think i found a young, shallow, closed minded girl.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> or the man being a little to sad down there.?
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_20> you should take charge- ask him yourself
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_25> how do you know his feelings arent mutual!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> Look at it this way...you are gaining a son!!!
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_70> : )  We're not boring...trust me.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_70> Obviously, you don't want to blow up on her.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> yes, especially if you know you love them.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_60> try to b frns with her 1st lor...
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_45> I CERTAINLY AGREE with jdd3636 on his answer!!
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> hallo,r u mad u have 2 choose one ,n that,s if u know what love mean,s.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> if you use sex to find love all you have is a fling.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_75> if both of u are cheating you shouldnt be together--u guys are looking for different things out there.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_80> of course u won't fall on first sight.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> It's like saying, Look at my butt-floss!
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_35> i've been everywhere and i have meet alot of girls.
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_40> Girl you need to drop him... because he sounds like a trick.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_40> Marriage is not something that you just do because you feel like it...
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_60> one of they is kinda iffy.
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_65> No one likes to hang out with rude people.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> if it clicks and you two really want to do it, then why not.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> if it's mutual, all the better!
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_45> how do ask a girl to be my girlfriend?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> What about finding a cute chubby girl?
<NbChars_185> <LevSim_35> my ex's double ex does that, and she never flurts with him
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> if you sure about this information just get divorced
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_35> And by the way u know it better whether you like the guy or not.
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_50> you are little weird dude...you ask all this strange questions about 'family'
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> and she helped me throw a party.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> What ever you do, don't set him up to fail, accept him for the great things he does do
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_65> theres still rooms you haven't open yet.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_85> when he breaks up with the other girl you can have him .
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> okay this is good one... Start with sharing fantasies.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_70> If you're trying to be subtle, then I recomend that you make it a 'no big deal' thing.
<NbChars_150> <LevSim_65> go out what could be worse
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> because he doesnt want anymore conversation... WHY?
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> say ur sorry and hope he wont have been to humiliated
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_90> Depends on when he had the baby.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_90> not all guys are the same.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_75> then you say im so stressed, can i kiss you?
<NbChars_50> <LevSim_45> I don't think so (father of three)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> the love to see them grow and know u as person!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_25> THE BEST THING TO DO IS TALK TO HER.
<NbChars_160> <LevSim_50> that's like asking why are men assholes.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_45> The bills, the kids, the jobs, blah, blah, etc.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_30> hmm... touch question... Why dont you send me a pic a lemme decide whether you are or not??
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_40> before u ask next time type ur question in search.....this question is asked more than a 1000 times...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_20> so maybe you shouldn't feel so bad at least until you talk to him.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_80> Just leave your email loged on accidentally...and see what happens!
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_50> dont come back onto him too quickly, just make sure he knoes ur glad to be back with him.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> do u think i'm boyfriend material.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> has your guy asked your dad yet?
<NbChars_75> <LevSim_75> sort of person, and you could be just as right with that approach as any other.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> You just have to have enough balls!
<NbChars_170> <LevSim_40> love is life  love, and life would love back you  so love all
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> Gotta go where the type of man you desire is.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_65> #2 - You're in 8th grade?
<NbChars_300> <LevSim_25> hi im 15 and i live in USA-TX how r u
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_10> IT CAN BE DONE, BUT IT'S HARD TO TRUST A CHEATTNG INDEVIDUAL,YOU MIGHT FORGIVE BUT YOU NEVER FORGET.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_45> but i know they mostly arent all gay.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_50> no human knows love, only god
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> and if he think about it.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_25> IF THE CAT IS OUT THE BAG LET HIM MAKE A MOVE.
<NbChars_130> <LevSim_45> Not sure but i guess it could mean a three-way: female-guy-female
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_25> No glove , no love... he got the point!
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> Dear what makes u think that married men r boring.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_30> i know my guy like me to lick his nipples and penis.
<NbChars_55> <LevSim_40> I don't want to go to the bar and hook up with some guy.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_25> Skinny girls ycuk,  you get that skinny girl taste in your mouth.
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_60> Not really........remember what they say .......the fruits of patience are always rewarding!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_15> I THINK U ARE JUST A SEXY BEAST
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> It's already been said but I'm going to say it again... No glove, no love.
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_50> not any more than other people.
<NbChars_180> <LevSim_55> i am so sorry i wish i could help.
<NbChars_135> <LevSim_65> you say he's giving her what you couldn't .
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_50> because you have some hot buns!
<NbChars_125> <LevSim_45> If your little sisters like my sister then she is a guy crazy middle-schooler!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_45> if he does say thanks and u see he's a nice one, then u got yourself a boyfriend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If u r enjoying his love then continue untill u not caught some fresh fish like meeeeeeee.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_70> Plus, you have to know that your daddy is just that, your daddy.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_65> Its getting really out of hand, its affecting my schoolwork, but it won't go away
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_45> If you really love this lucky lady.... KEEP IT REAL WITH YOURSELF!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_20> MAYBE HE HAS SOMEONE AND IT'S NOT THE RIGHT TIME.
<NbChars_85> <LevSim_75> because your as rare as the blue bearded tit mouse.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_75> But I love her to much to hurt her.
<NbChars_65> <LevSim_25> Girls meet different kinds of guys - good/bad, handsome/ugly, etc.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_30> Don't worry...He'll get his chance to be happy with you, too, someday.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_30> First u have to no ur gf like what type of guy.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_15> u consider yourself blind in things happening.
<NbChars_140> <LevSim_55> first of all you can't make a girl like you.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_75> it is shorthand for a threesome...female guy female...lots of fun too
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_95> Personally I dont like it all bald.
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> be patient we grow out of it and mature.
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_65> so you've gotta decide right here and now.
<NbChars_95> <LevSim_50> A combination of it.Girls luv a person w/ good heart n at the same tym w/ good looks..........
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_90> I have no idea on what to get her!
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_75> If he's THAT bad, and counseling isn't an option ... just TELL him!!
<NbChars_115> <LevSim_75> so i wish u the best of luck in ur life and ur other half
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> put some anger behind your voice.
<NbChars_110> <LevSim_80> It is OK as long as she isn't a dude!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_70> Sounds like you've got a good chance.

<NbChars_130> <LevSim_50> do you want to sleep with him?

<NbChars_180> <LevSim_20> Tell her U WANNA GO OUT WITH ME???
<NbChars_120> <LevSim_80> I spent 5,000 on my dress!

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_90> yes it is importent in a relationship
<NbChars_90> <LevSim_75> first of all, think about the way you act with him.

<NbChars_120> <LevSim_75> Are you being nice to her?
<NbChars_80> <LevSim_60> Dude that is what I call LUST...
<NbChars_100> <LevSim_95> for religious resons.... there are so many people that are not as strong as you are.
