<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And so what if it is a rebound relationship for both of you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Good luck in your search for the one!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> WHY DOES EVERYONE SEEM TO WANT SOMEONE THAT THEY CAN'T HAVE AND KNOW THAT THEY SHOULDN'T WANT.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Do you like to argue and fight???
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> So if you're set on that, that's the way to go!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> My ex of 3 years cheated.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Work at it but don't let him keep you locked up at home.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> >>Other than those two things, just ask him once in a while.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Also men get bored and tire way before woman do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> She's strong and loving and most of all...really wasn't as happy as she thought she was.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> its one way of saying i don't like you!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> King had a song about this - Only your Mother loves you (and see might be jiving too).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> He loves you, too, girl...Time will tell.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he wants me to change how i look.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I know I have someone to come home to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> did you fell goog because i want to have sex, but you have to be careful
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you want all your friends forever?)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU ARE SLUTTY.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Going to a club and dancing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't go anywhere you went with him or her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> They're a lot of fun - there's plenty to do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it all depends on when ur ready.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Stay 100 miles away from this guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just be prepared cause if it happen once it can happen again!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I'm just looking for the girl who wants that time with me
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Least not till he gets another girlfriend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Wife says, We don't wear that shit.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you're asking, then you should break-up w/ and open yourself to other options.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> why do gays want to get married?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> (saying sorry to him without commiting a mistake is humilation to ur self...AND DON'T EVER GET WEAK!!)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> do you have to rush your choice?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> THEY BOTH DONT RESPECT YOUR FEELING.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> No seriously, think about howmany cocky girls are out there.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> She is too afraid to ask him out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> get a grip, how can you love someone that you don't even communicate with.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i'd ask you out, but i live in Oregon and have no idea where you live...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> they have never proformed before and it doubles the plesure!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i'll probably go and see one.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Either way, best of luck but I'm just glad that I have brown hair!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Mail me a pick honorarius@yahoo.com and I will tell you...

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i hardly everrr see him in school either usually i see hima t my brothers basketball games .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he's telling that to some gurls too... he's a womanizer..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> DROP HIS BUTTT, THERE ARE PLENTY OF FISH IN THE SEA OF AMORE:0)

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> No way im 5`4 and he`s 6`2
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Dont you know the number one rule, Trust No One.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> we've tried breakin up a couple times but it never happens.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Oh and some because theyre thin and skinny and nowadays anorexic girls are a turn on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if u have penis than its no problem u just hv to  penitrate her pussy with ur errect penis.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> in that case tkake some defense classes.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I just got out of a 3 yr relationship with my baby's father.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> what happened when the politician took viagra?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Hi, my name is xxxxxx  Been working for me for years.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i can onli say...women r complicated...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> We like soft approch and a lil bit of chasing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you would be genuinly suprised in the type of people that go to them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it is very fun and enjoyable especially when you meet each other after texting a few months
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Hey, I'm in NYC I'll help you out if your around!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Sounds strange but it worked in about 3-5 days for me!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't worry, I aint working with much either.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> why does it matter what they think if they dont get along dont spend time togather.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if he is then you have a good man.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If He Likes You, You'll Know!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i guess its normal, but id just move on
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> The rest is easy from there!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I like any guy that is funny.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Girl only you can decide on this...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Why do you ask this question??????????????
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> do go telling everyone just because you think thats right.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> 10 years gap is just nice.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Then if he still doesn't like you, then move on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ok i see him ever week in psr but i just cant talk to him!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Beacuse they feel insecure with less educated guys..........
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> For one thing if it doesn't work out there goes your job.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And I hope to God it doesn't ever pass!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Only the ones that aren't worth your time
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> smaller of course, and it is all about LOOKS!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You guys don't have any reason to hate each other.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you don't you'll always wonder.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Some people choose not to because of thier religion, others don't.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> give it a chance because if you break up with them it would be harder to be friends
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> The Best of Luck to ya!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Men who were not ready to committ.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> this is a big day in both of your lives, it shouldnt be done quickly and without thought.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i'm 55 years old and still live at home with my mammy,whats wrong with that!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> one man willing to move 21 hours/1,400 miles just to be with me.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> REMEMBER IT TAKES TWO NOT ONE
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if he really didn't like her and did like you, then he would have already dumped her for you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> hang around untill the bar closes -- or visit a prison
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> PLEASE DONT MISS OUT ON THIS ONE !!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Because believe it or not, women hate cocky men.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> hello: i am looking to visit your country.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Overtime should I give him another chance?

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i have told her i liked her and she said she would want to ruin or friendship.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you can join a community site with live chat and webcam chat
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> show her your naked baby pictures.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Is very important to last at least 30-45 minutes!!!

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If he if flurting with her ok jump him .

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I want my wife to GROW too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Well that is just the way it is I guess.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> One girl Michelle, who probably wouldn't mind being named, spoke up and said she didn't believe in it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I can just toss him to side and forget about him like last night's trash........LOL
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but he was a lil busy after that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I do not know what to do because she knows how much I care about him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you do eat something like that then just quit.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it could be that u need to piss or the last dream u had
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You know.......if he wants to wear my pants all he has to do is ask.......sheesh!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you were friends before and have stronger feelings now then it should be O>K>
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and i want to try again.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> figure out what style of arrangements you would like and flowers.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Lie lie lie and then Lie some more
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Wait until you find that out for sure first and then go from there!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you two are at a dance, he shouldn't really care.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Trust him,  don't bring it up again.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> honestly, most girls are just Waiting for the guy to Tell her how he truly feels.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> HELL YA I WOULD LOVE TO MEET THE LADYS!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I actually ponder this one now and again.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i met this guy once, very romantic, i met him in this huge rainstorm.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ok now some guy's like girls like that and some don't
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it comes right after threeplay and before fiveplay.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> When I fall in love, I feel stupid.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you have to ask, then you are not in love.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you start to feel the it comming on then start the four play again.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i don't understand someone please give me the answer
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i saved a good $500-600 doing my own flowers and it was no hassle at all.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I JUST GOT A  DIVORCE AND SO DO DID HE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But ask a girl about the sympthoms because i'm a boy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Be you show a little toghness thats what girls like atleast most of them but mostly be yourself
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> follow ur heart... it's neva wrong
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> They bother U all day long.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> say i love you and if the wait to say it back it tells it all
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Try asking her out again and see what she says.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ;)  There is no way to make someone fall in love with you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Ask her questions (don't just talk).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> When you first fall in love, your gitty, goofy, and silly happy just thinking about that person.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And remember there is more then 1!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i think they just look better than a whole lot of nations out there.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> We got married all over again!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> All in all I don't think it really matters.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And Im sure as heck not driving 5 hrs just to hang out unless I really really like her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> how often can you have sex with pam anderson?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I told her that I loved her and truly meant it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> think about what good it brought about.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> the thing is im a person that does not like to brake others heart.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> give a rose and express ur love
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I LIKE THICK BECAUSE I FEEL CHEATED WITH A THIN ONE!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Remember, TILL DEATH DO YOU PART!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Bcozz we always find a life partner therfor we attract with opposite side
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> what the hell r ya talking abt?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> IF YOU KEEP TALKING TO HIM FOR ANOTHER WEEK,HE MIGHT THINK HE IS MARRIED TO YOU.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> women dont want much, just some acknowldgement and sometimes help.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> At least thats what it seems like to me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't be afraid to say no.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> dump him...there are always more fish in the sea.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> TO ME IT REALY DOSE'NT  MATTER, BUT A HAND FULL IS QUITE ENOUGHT FOR ME.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> choose the one that adores you the most!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you still released at least a thousand!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You go to a bar and get drunk!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> give it some time and thought.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no u shouldnt leave them...just teach them what to do to please u better...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> bembie hit the nail on the head
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no.u guys kiss when ur ready
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> haha julesac is funny, but mean.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If youre asking this, u surely have already distanced yourself from her and yet remaining a friend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> DONT FORGET TO CHOOSE AND VOTE FOR BEST ANSWER!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Dont try to figure it out thats jus the way it is.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I dont know.But i know of another website that i go to..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> OK IT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH YOUR STARTING TO HAVE FEELINGS FOR THIS BOY!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> !he must be a control freak
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE GIRL OR THE AND HOW INTERSTED THE GIRL IS IN THE GUY.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> look, try and get out to meet people.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> usually it is multiple things not just one thing
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if u really really really really really really like them
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> For the guys: (A) Do you prefer a bigger woman or a smaller woman?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If all you do is argue it's not worth it..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> What makes it worse is that I already went out with him for four years!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> u just have to be patient and the right girl will come along.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> unless you dont love your husband anymore and you have room for another man????
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> wife because then you can do more with out comminting a sin
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> She definitely wants you to think she's good looking, but she doesn't want that to be reason #1.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Depends, some days I want to have sex, somedays I don't.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> plus they are more passionate in love makin.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you play w/both at the same time, she will probably f-*# the sh%$ out of you!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Because he wouldn't work, hit me, used guilt trips, was a big mama's boy, etc.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> maybe because your the most beautiful girl they have seen.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it really depends if someone is vain or not.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> someone i can be myself with.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Send me your picture and contact me ..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Stay away from this guy friend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> the doctor can't even believe it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yes for sure, especially when she throw up!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If not, then don't sweat it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i could give you some pointers.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you feel your love is fading, don't just sit there and do nothing!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I will not stay with someone I don't trust.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i only once told a girl that i loved her, and i meant it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You married him and it was for a reason.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Rip off your shirt and do a Tarzan yell.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Yes, girl down there, don't have sex.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> they accept this in thier culture.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Always trail ride with a friend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you didn't give us very good information/  do you all live in one house.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Move on - so what if he's hot...looks aren't everything.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> lol  most important... just be yourself.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yes be disappointed and be mad!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Sorry, I never have felt that way!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i sure wont like any girl who would make my life difficult...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Or if he gets them first, you get the popcorn.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> practice, ask if your doing good.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but if u are sure then first tell your parents if you havent done allready.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well i met mine in a carnival.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Sounds like a rhetorical question :)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> WELL I BELIEVE EVERYBODY SHOULD KEEP THEIR OWN NAME.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but ur first kiss should feel like ur in hevan.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> There is nothing but trouble there!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> How to make a woman happy  To make a woman happy....?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> dont do things tht can get you hurt.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i mean of course you will be making more money if you work hard.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Please don't go up to her and tell her how good she looks.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I don't think it's good idea, u are not there for this purpose!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> go up to her and say 'hi, are you single?'
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i think he would make a great valentine.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just be prepared to let her go.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> rather than just sit there and wait till u are a good one.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just tell them, what are they gonna do, slap you??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Get a massage..and get away from it all..hehe..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Well if u really like this guy smile and make nice talk with him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> take them both out at the same time
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it happened to me and i am now dating that person
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> only two points to make friends  1.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> so you might just be over looking the type of men who think the world of you..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Preferrably someone who doesn't hate you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> We tried to move on but it didn't work.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> WHEN WILL PEOPLE IN THIS EFFED UP WORLD FINALLY REALIZE THIS?!?!?!?!?!?!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I wouldn't bother calling him back.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Try not to hang out with him and find another guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> look for another hot girl, so she will be jealous.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> so in my opinon ur not a hoe!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Red= love, black = death ect...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if she likes him than she dont like u dump her is not his fault that she strays
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> for me anything after 3 days and i might start to forget about you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> find a girl who has talets she also must be prety
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> There no one you can trust more than a good friend !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> start the day off with breakfast out...then perhaps a nice walk.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Then go pick them up (If she say yes).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If yes, why do I heard some girl said flowers ar not going to last?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> may be its interesting for them
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> could it ever be the same...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it's not that bad... at least it is not Bella
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Could it be because some men are liars and fat mouths??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Or you could tell her and have one of those fairy tale romances...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> FINALLY A CULTURE THAT HAS IT RIGHT.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> my twin wont talk or listen to me
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> want to get something you can not get rid of go ahead then
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Only I am not thinking about him but I am having dreams about him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if ur talkin ten then i think it would be fine to get a video/ computer game.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Go for it and take the chance!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If he CAN'T then take him to a place where they have slowdances (dinner date, maybe?)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i feel this is most beautiful in a family life.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> IT'S YOUR CHOICE NOT TO  HATE ONE,  I DISLIKE THEM TO SAY THE LEAST.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> NEVER ever get married without a Prenup....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Get a life and don't waste mine.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> She says your too good for her?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Guys come & go, but friends are forever!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it could probably mean a lot of things.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yes it is normal cause their is lots of people who still likes some they broke up with.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I`d like to see what a black female has to say about this.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> guys are stupid!who knows why they do what they do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well if they gave you their phone number you dont have to wait at all
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> cause were masters of the universe...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I'm in love and don't care who knows it Buddy the Elf.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And whatever you do, don't try to have both of them at once.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you really wanted to be with him, you wouldn't be asking.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Remember being friends with someone online is ok but there are limits.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> when my sis kisses someone she closes her eyes to get ready.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Now me, I wouldn't marry any women who didn't want to change her name, but that is just me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Umm small party for the family
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> girls are perverts they just hide it and act like it around other girls secretly
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and im only in  fith grade o ya!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But you do what you want.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't do that, it won't work.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If they don't, it's time to move on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> He everything I ever wanted with the looks, money, stuff.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Yes, and it is bad luck to see the bride at the wedding.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Nope, she is not a liar.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> SHUT THE HELL UP AND BE GAY IF YOU WANT TO!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and he had his nose pierced.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yup, i can lift him, he's only 185....lol
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you need a therapist for that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Maybe some perverted guys like the really young looking asian girls
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You should go see a shrink!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Giving you stupid excuses of the wall!Acting the way he didn't before!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Be strong, and hang in there.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Nope, he's too darned big and I'm too darned weak!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Basically if she is so drunk that she becomes a slob / or slut then yes it is unattractive...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Exchange letters, e-mails, chat online, talk over the phone, send packages...  Just keep in touch!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Especially if you don't feel like it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he dribbles... he shoots... he scores... 2 points...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Giving it up just for him to stick around is like selling your soul to the devil.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I cant give you a wife view but hopefully mine is just as good.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> plus it takes the pressure off of me to ask someone...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Depends on the woman, it's better shaved=-)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ask in english terms...cannot understand you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> hey, I'm a guy, but i'll tell you a little.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i like him alot and i want to win him over not push him away.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Ok Like I really really really like this guy and I dont know if he likes me back.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> btw - ur avatar looks familiar.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It's been over 6 months & I can't seem to get over it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> maybe he thinks he will  be turned down.just ask...i would.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You gotta think about that and that should help you out on seeing if you can trust him!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> A picture the shape of a heart with you and her when you both first dated....thats special
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i am in college and he is my only sourse of income until i get out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> listen it aint that easy.I got with my ex-boyfriend in 2nd grade,then again in 4th,and again in 8th.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i've been with this girl for 8 months and we haven't kissed is this bad?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Some guys don't like boobs at all!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> or that she just wants to see other people?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And hes seen me every day for about 4 or 5 years!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> there was his stop so he got off the train.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I mean the worst -the absolute worst - is that she says no.TAKE A CHANCE & GOOD LUCK!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But, I know exactly what I want in a relationship.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i would flirt and send flowers and candies to my self and then he would ask u out sometime
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I also hate seeing my dad unhappy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I feel bad because I know that I snore sometime -- most people do, right?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i like sos and need to know if im in love
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you guys TRUELY love each other then u can work out all the fighting etc.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> because neither of you have the guts to call it quits
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> However that does not mean that big girls can't be cute.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But he is getting married this month.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But those guys are jerks and you don't want them anwyay.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> SAY WILL U GO OUT WITH ME!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and get married only after you've been with a guy for more than 2 years.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Man has penis and woman has clitoris.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> SEPERATE THE BAD THING AND MOVE ON!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> (It would be easier to do if I were mad, though!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If she will tell the administration i will be expelled coz its pakistan not america
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you should get to know her and sooner or later you will ask her out or she will.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Like I said; he already knows that you like him, so just take a deep breathe and ask him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Maybe you and I can get together sometime & we'll find love with one another.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I would be, but I'm just married !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Play the field a bit now.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> As everyone said... dont get married so early.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just want to know HAVE YOU BEEN TO THE DOC YET !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Pay Attention to what the other person says!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just Talk your spouse about this
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you are into sixth graders you are obviously young.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i was thinking about a medium pink color, but with what??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Ask if they wanna go somewhere with you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> -a trip to amusement park such as roller coaster or even theatrical museum.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Or do guys really do prefer bigger women?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> problem is i really like him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> so id say, they do work out, just not a lot of the times...hope this helps...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> SHould I dump him because of his mother
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I did this before (accidentally) and my friend was mad that I deleted him!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I dont think I mind either way.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but thats her way... you could try it that way or you could just keep your eyes open...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> there are some that do, but you should be able to tel.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> r u talking about ur avatar?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I dont ever remember giving a girl a Cristmas gift unless I liked her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I don't know what to do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Try to be your self and don't show off
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> so just take it day by day-step by step.think of how he lost a good thing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Dang it, if only every man knew What Women Want the world would be a much happier place!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> compliments, honesty and make it about her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i think hse will crash him!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> IT JUST MEANS THAT SHE IS REALLY INTERESTED IN THE GUY.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> please do.. im thinking  you would get slapped mid-reach,or kicked in the groin.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Only now she and I are both divorced.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if he/she want to see you picture rightaway it sex!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> hey it's better than her givin u a fake # to call lol!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> tell her to move to MASS.............
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you feel this strongly about it then maybe you shouldn't get married.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> The pictures I've seen...I would say Maui or the Bahamas.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> the guy i like is mad at me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You're 13 don't even worry about it...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> That way you dont have to worry about you calling him too much!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I am a guy and let me tell you, we love to chase!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Thanks for the pep in advance!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> we always seem to push the ones taht we love away.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> they think that they can control other peoples lives when thye cant
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> thats weird but maybe idk ill talk to my friend by his locker.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I don't know....how would you like something crammed up your butt!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If a guy cares he calls.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> what special gift can i give my would be brother in law for his birthday?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he probably doesnt want to either.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> hold her hands, look to her eyes and say it, but only say it if you really love her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Some guys do...and some guys don't.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> hey i really want to know so please help me out!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> The timing just wasnt right for it with the old guy...you'll see!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Generally kind and my fifth: I'll just be dissapointed if she's stupid.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> its one of the gifts we can always give ourselves.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I do not believe trust has to be earned, because how is that even possible.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> lol so if thats u u deff need to stop that is FONKY!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> DON'T LET HER RULE YOUR LIFE, SHE WILL JUST HAVE TO LEARN TO DEAL WITH IT.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I have yahoo email and that works for me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I wouldn't worry too much about it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Oh yes, the trick ass hoe's never had a chance.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> when you can fart in front of the one your dating
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> depends on how old they are.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And any guy who sas he woul is prolly not being entirely honest with himself.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you flirt with him, the challange is not there.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you need your x emotionally - then ya got some troubles.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> 20 to 32...she doesn't have to be younger than you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> my be she don't love  you but  try to use your  brean not  your haerd
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you want your girlfriend forever..........then just don't let her know that you want her forever, simple.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> There are tons of cheap ideas out there, just find what you like and work with it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And if you are worried about doing it - performance wise - DONT.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> find a nother girl and if that dosent work move back
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Most often (not always) that will be guys around your age, give ot take.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if u you act like dat all da time she might think u desperate.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> not everyone on here is in school.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> tell him what you really want...that's what they tell me but never got to do...speak up...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> should i  make the first move or should i wait for him to make the first move ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> What a typical double standard you have set up!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> after a while you dont even see the color.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> :) I haven't tried it yet, but I am still trying to get up the nerve....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you two are serious then asking her that question shouldn't bother her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> sak her out what's up with that?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> How about...Would you like to go out with me sometime?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yah look me up if you are ever in florida  lol!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Those was good times I tells ya.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> its all about her, and no it shouldnt be something that happends on a first date.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Do you really want to spend the rest of your life with someone you argue with all the time.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If he comes to his senses then great if not SCREW HIM!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you are too good for them
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Jump him because she likes him??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> depending on the age, cds or dvds.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> 20 YEARS DOWN THE ROAD THAT IS ALL YOU CAN BE SO START FROM THE BEGINNING
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ill like to visit usa what are the needfull things
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> anyone with any ideas, tips or general info, email me back!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> u sound like a very lovely person so dont let some of these gals drag you down.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you dont look, just go out and enjoy yourself and have fun and a gf will come along.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't persue it, he is getting married.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> like clear liquid and turns yellow when dry?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i mean if in your country there is an short messaging system in your cellphone then find a textmate!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Then when she starts closing her eyes , kiss her in the lipps and then its up to you!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> please be honest with me i can handle the truth
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Have fun, and remember to never get so comfortable that you always know what's going to happen next!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Its Shows how much they care about you!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Tell her that you miss her and that you love her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Coffee, lunch, site seeing, walk/talk/play in the park, museum, movie matinee
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> WHAT YOU  WHANT IS A HOOKER, YOU CAN FIND THAT IN ANY CORNER OF THE WORLD.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but now we do all these things together and i dont know what to do..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Because if it fails you be up $h*T!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and its been the best thing for at least me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Try using some of these, but only if they actually apply!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> THE PROBLEM IS THAT HE CHEATED ON ME RECENTLY AND IT WAS THE WORST THAT HE COULD OF DONE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you are happy she should be happy, unless he really is being bad to you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> We like it when guys do things for us and think about us.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> maybe if you give him space he will eventually call you back.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Tell him you don't want a real relationship.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you look creepy and you look..they'll all think you're leering.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I don't know about love,but he likes you for sure
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if a guy really respects u then he'll understand.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ask yourself and decide.and if you can afford it, do if you want to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> because he is a superhero that is the closest to being just a regular guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> sometimes the difficulties are worth it if the the good outweighs the bad
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I dont think it is wise to date at work.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> STUPID U NEED A THEORY CLASS 4 THAT!!!!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> let it take it's course from there.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> about what they think about gay marrige/ relationshiops?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> so ofcourse i had to ask him if he was blowin me off.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> guys will think youre hot no matter what with this usually.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but i dont htink that by not having sex with him he will become unfaithful or leave you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> The safest rules of internet dating are these: 1. chat via email and messenger 2. chat on the phone.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> marriage is really about trusting & communicating
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Ok, so I had this problem too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> depending on what you kissed ;)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it depends on if you could trust him before!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> make sure you dont make her hate you just get your point across too her
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Uh- wher've U been meeting these Filipinas?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Imgaine if it was JUST considered love??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> That way, you aren't exactly telling them what you specifically don't like about them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If he is, then go for it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Then see if shes open for a dinner & a movie.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> hey im sorry i don't know and i wish best of luck to both of you!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> HOWEVER----i find him looking at me every now and then.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> this is sin, our selves have started this
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Fun includes eating meals (not breakfast if yo know what I mean).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> MAKE A KIND MOVE , IF NO RESPONCE U KNOW WHAT TO DO !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> let him make the first move if u do it may make u look like ur ubsesd with him!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You people have no right to get married!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> My tragic love story was I loved him very much and he loved me too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> u seem desperate and you'll never find a      if you're desperate.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But he swears that we're just friends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> looks don't really matter unless you are trying to prove something.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> again, i know once u have sex with him, he is no longer a good friend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> the fact that a guy is sooo self centered is a huge turn off for me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> DON'T RUSH IT FEEL ALL YOUR EMOTIONS COME ALIVE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it a two way traffic until you get them you will know which one it is
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> So you have ONE baby out of wedlock.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I know i'm overtly picky about people HOW CAN I STOP IT!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it hurts....alot...maybe some girls might say that's it?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> im going to jump that boy is that the right choice
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> SO it was a good ideea!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if she gets drunk then it is not a turn off.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Because some women send men tiny messages with out saying it clearly.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I'd perfer if they left me alone...  sorry, i got off-topic.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ask her to go do something she is interested in or to see a movie she'd like.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You are a man <--- Term used lightly!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Haha...  Too bad it's not automatic like MSN or AOL.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and thats how they'll react to it so yea its bad situation for you and him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> go back to that person at once before it becomes too late for you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> lol I too want to smack that smile off her face
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and ask if he wants to dance with you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> then she might say that looks ugly i think (a color) looks better.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ask him to go see a doc.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I never went out with him a second time.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> First of all, why did u guys break up?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> why wait,,,,, go ahead do it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> as long as he dosent mind , who elses opinion matters?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i think im still totally in love w/ him...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I never wanted to have sex again.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> The main thing is to not try to get back at the one who wronged you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if u have to ask other people i really dont think ur ready to
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Im a gilr, i say those things....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> a big savings area is flowers.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> time wiil tell give it six months and see what happens.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> either that or you are the only one he has a chance at getting some booty from
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well from your list, i would have to choose spiderman.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i was cheated on for 3 of the years.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> all seniors think freshman girls are easy, its sad but true
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and if he says yes than you can tell him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and impress her with affection and love.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And if you have, what was it like?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Celebrate Valentine with joy and fun...give eachother gifts and hav a fun...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> any women beside the ugly guys will look hot...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> So, when I moved in my neighbor asked me out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you should probaly make a move because he is obviosly shy
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just on a much harsher scale as time goes on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> be yourself say whats up and you might get a response
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> there are many times that you love the guy but not sure did he love you also.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if your talkin hubby or the like i'd say tools toys for his vehicle, sports related things.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> That got me really hot, but I ran off.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Me, I'll pick up the tab if, I can get your vote for best answer.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> k. So what size of breast does the average guy like do you think?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> many women 22 are dating men 27 so the 22 yo men feel insecure and have to fish downstream
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Lust less like...you just go out?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> they probobly know you cant really hide that but you should tell your parents
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I will make u princess in planet Kripton !!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> My last girlfriend's Bf did that to her (before we met), and she still kept him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> my friend has a bf who she talks 2 online and on the phone.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> do you like fake nails or manicured ones?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Tell her, girls like to her the truth GOOD LUCK
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> we can restle around and be the best of friends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Stay true to your husband...after all, he's the one you said I do to...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> DONT LISTEN TO THESE FOOLS WITH AL THEIR B.S.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yeah, im a guy so i dont really have to pay.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Remember, NO BIRD EVER FLEW ON ONE WING!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just let her know what you feel.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it depends, if you really love him you will prob think youll want to egnolage it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you or the other person is married, RUN!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> No men don't but little boys do
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Help me win this debate with her !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> My girlfriend's the nuttiest, but I love her anyway.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> simple enough, do like anyone else does.....play with it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> sweetheart let him go ,if he is ment to be with u he will come back to you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Of course after 3 day of that my back went out LOL.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> stay alive and get your old life back.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> So thats why I ask why dont guyz ever know what they want with any kinda relationship!?!?!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Maybe ask him out to lunch or a movie or somthing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Girls don't like guys who is all about themselves.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it depends do u like either one???
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I was always looking and I kept picking jerks.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> so, no i feel its a choice and one does what feels comfortable to them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Some do,some don't have it in them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just do what makes you happy!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> because for some reason i cannot
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> So it would have to be love.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> because....you know.......try to search you love.....but becareful.....!!!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> don't ask her to perform some act for you, make her the spotlight.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> girls are simply impressed if u can show a little care, respect and honesty to them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Tell the bastard to GET OUT.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> they think it is the only right way!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Good luck and keep it cool!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> That said u need to figure out youself if u want to stay married to him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And I hate him for it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Men like this, typically become wife beaters if you don't OBEY them!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> First off, I have 4 kids....so a homemaker is more work than my job even.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no i haven't..i prefer normal-looking guys
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it defenetely looks like he has feelings for u.do u show how u feel;;u should!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> everything seems so open and hit and run with most people these days.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i have a problem of unloading all my junk up front and maybe i told this guy to much.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> the right date can save money on lots of things.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you truly love your man & want to work it out then tell your X to respect that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> That only makes her easier to bed.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't think you should try it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> simple...honesty and love and try to true with them
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i hoping for at least a 90% but realistically i think its more like 70% or 65%.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but cuddling up with a large women is one of the best feelings i know of.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And women also expect guys to act like that, so why should they grow up?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> A couple of ways: -  Get him drunk.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> The problem is not if u ask her while at work or not.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Stick with the 13 & 14 year old boys .. they are easier to control anyway.. LOL Good luck
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> YOU NEVER LET A MAN  MISTREAT YOU
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> PS Im not a stay at home romantic dinner type of girl.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> !,anyway when i left him i swore i,d never get married again!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> pickup lines are tacky..just be yourself and complament her alot..women like that
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You'll be fine just have fun!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> not all the time, sometimes men shave them, it depends on the woman,
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i love him but i think im ready to move oe, meet new guys!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> so wait for another 4 years.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I hope I see some of it soon.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I don't want to be mean.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> also u shood wait a while b for having kids.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i would like to have some fun with u that's why i answered this stupid question
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> try to contact their q&a team..they'll help you through..have a nice day!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Because womens don`t put out often...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if he insists, it means he only after sex.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> B) Looks definitely matter, anyone saying they don't is probably lying.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Whle MAKING LOVE is like living a fantasy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> when you 18 or 20 because when they said something they dont mean it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> when possible, try to make it yourself.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But (there's always a but isn't there?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If she is not into you anymore...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i seriously doubt that you are in love with that many guys.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> on average id say about 45% at first but than one you get to knowthe person maybe 15%
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Play sports with your guy friends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> She will tell you if it's not OK.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I don't mean, do you think women are sexy and beautiful.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> how do i get he to stop nagging me and leave me alone.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> a sex toy, that way you can both enjoy it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> men without hair look like little boys to me, and it's not sexy at all.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i agree, just kiss him... he'll respond one way or another.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> a good way is to imagine yourself without him/her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> here in America it is not so important...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well if it was before you then he wasnt cheating at all... obviously.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> man how many times I passed up a great oppertunity by worrying about someone saying No......
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Because the white women are taking up all the men!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ur self image is also very important.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Have you ever had a PAP smear.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> good god how old are you ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but i think they both like me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Okay well first thing it sounds as if YOU GUYS ARE ALREADY MARRIED!.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yes jaime is going to ask rubi out.... but it is not yoru business...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> that is a sign, things like that can make it really obvious
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> u should take the time to get to know both of them equally without goin out with them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i'd love to hear logical opinons on this, thanks
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you like the guy then go for it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Having FUN with guy friends is OK.  1.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> So its natural with that guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> women take on alot and sometimes they feel like they do it for nothing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no, because i'm not married yet
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> let me know what you think, thanks
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you are gay BE GAY!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> good luck and hang in there.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i like older girls so i think this is sick and wrong that they cant go out with her
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i am just curious to what everyone thinks.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> my last bf i met driving round a roundabout in another car!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> becuz if you do then your gonna lose your friend over a guy!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It really was a casual aside when I said it -- I didn't think he would remember.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> are you a country girl or a city girl.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> hang out all day together and to top it off touch his feet.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> im very bored bein single.sittin back watchin other gurlz hava all da fun!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> )women are curious about sex with other women, even me!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I don't know what you said because I was to lazy to read your typing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i hate it my self, i love the straight ones
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> This is Doc Izzy and I love and adore bigger women!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> there are not any words that are going to make it any better.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> do it before it is to late
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well to tell u tha truth u learn but u have to actually do it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Nay Pier is a great place or one of the museums....there r alot of great resteraunts of hotels.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> thats a stereotype( not a country girl by the way)And I think Im sexy in my own way.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he wont turn you down .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well i hope you read this really well.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> lots of men like thick girls, most of them are black.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If she's interested she'll call later.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> No, you won't because you know he has cheating tendancies.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Ask ur self that, if you know what I mean.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I find if I try real hard I can see things I know aren't there normally there.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Lets get coffee and chat and take it from there!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just move on with your life and frind some one eles!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ILL BET YOUR NOT, BUT TRY TO EMAIL ME ATILIKETHICKCHIX@YAHOO.COM AND I WILL BE HONEST.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I really care about you and I can't stop thinking about you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> is worth  the wait when you are ready.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you don't know ask someone who would.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> keep away ur fear and tell him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> thats a chance your gonna have to take.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> So if you want to be attractive to losers, creeps, and pervs Drink up!

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> WHATEVER YOU DO...DO NOT TELL HIM TOO SOON!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> We can't answer if she really means it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i dont like a guy dat does dat all da time.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> then u can make an easier decision.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Your girlfriend will just think you're a jerk.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> sometimes but you have to observe the one you call your man.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Replaying everything you ever did to me?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But don't just sit around waiting for the phone to ring.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I dated a guy this past year and he got to the a violent point.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Leave it alone-I don't care what she says, she's in enough pain.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> how would anyone know if they don't know anything about you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just find one that loves you too.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and i mean Really be her friend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> how do I get my sweetheart to show me he loves me
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> WELL BASICALLY YOU HAVE TO STOP TALKING TO HIM AND STOP THINKING ABOUT HIM
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> they never met but she says they're in love.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't do this over the phone, email, etc.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just try and make the best of what's to come.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Either you move on with your life or you try to make it work with this person.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> She's the love of my life and I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> because women think with their brains.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I'm still in love with my ex and I'm so mad at my cousin because my ex likes her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Only time will tell spend time with friends have fun don't thimk sbout it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Thats why I do not get in chat rooms anymore, unless its to laugh at all the freaks.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ohhh this is what i did - big bad mistake on my part.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I have no idea where to begin!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But he chaeted, so i guess I can lift or carry my husband.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if she is calling just to bablle then tell her to not call you so often!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> thats all i have 2 say.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you shouldn't be asking this question?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i was also thinking about lime green.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I mean the both of you together.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I have a close girl friend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Wanting to be something they're not?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well, if u can imagine ur self with him in bed @ night!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> they like the challange i know thats what i love about it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> depends on the girl I guess... fair skinned females look extra pale when they have black hair.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Oh man i should do that when im dating next time!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't listen to what anyone else tells you to do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I really like this guy, and I don't know if it's just a crush, or if I love him......

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> No, Not if you have to ask.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> the list could go on and on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But he might enjoy all the waiting, dreaming & teasing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't eat where you take a s***.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> of course you do wanna chat hit me up fla_cat_blue@yahoo.com
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> When he teases you about the stupid little things.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if u think that he feels the same way about you, why not?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well, in my experience, a lot of the time one of them ends up cheating on the other.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> They are often worse than men!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I've heard of friends getting married about 6 months after meeting somebody.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i don't know what u mean.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you want kids, then homemaker.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> what's the worst that could happen.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Intellect - a chick with brains is just sexy!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> his/her intelligence,the way they carry themselves,good looks and activeness

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I was NOT gonna let her win.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Chances r, if u like her as a friend, ull like her as more.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> JUST BE YOURSELF WHEN YOU ARE WITH HER.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> guys think that they are special, and that they are only good enough for certain girls.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> find someone u like and say will u be my valentine!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Post more questions on Yahoo Answers!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Well,if the one boy picks on you, why like him?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Brokeback Mountain ,ok it's a guy but at least you'll be happy!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> size, shape,looks, ect should NOT matter at all...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> SEX IS NOT THE ONLY THING IMPORTANT IN LIFE DAMN IT!!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you're probably just too good for him anyway.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you like him or you don't like him?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> why dont you just ask her if you can kiss her?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Whos to say that country girls feel more sexy?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Well i dont no how old you are which would help.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just think about what you like and do it back for them....kinda like a tounge massage.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Here's my answer: A) MOST guys definitely do not prefer girls that are skin and bone.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> CUT YOUR COUSIN AN YOUR EX BOYFRIEND OFF COMPLETE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> or does his friends point at you when your with him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> YES IT IS VERY POSSIBLE TO ENJOY GIVING PLEASURE RATHER THEN RECIEVING IT
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Now I keep thinking of getting it on with a girl.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> depends on if they are brunette or not
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> is she just trying to use you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> U can have a big u-no-what, n suck in bed.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> get rid of the x if you are dating the guy you love right now.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It hurt like hell and I bled.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> cuddling, kissing, fondling, playing with each others sex organs before sex.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> when he does explain to him that it was a mistake to break up and want him back.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> My bf loves me to death and doesnt want to give me up.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you are already doing it so why yet bother?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> on the hood of my car at a waterfront in a light rain it was awesome!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I think you are probaly a nice guy and she probaly loves you alot.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> your looking to hard, or maybe you're looking in the wrong places... sign up for yahoo personals
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> only if you want it to be.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But if she doesn't have a reason then she isn't ur friend!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you have to find whats right for you and your partner/s!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you are definitely not a hoe, don't worry.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> GIRLS DON'T THINK IT'S COOL, THEY THINK IT'S GUYS WHO SMOKE ARE PATHETIC COS THEY ARE KILLING THEMSELVES
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> So - U like asian food?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> they don't mean to get them pregnant they just can't keep it in there pants because they are PIGS!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I like natural / real girls, I don't like fake looking prissy drama queens.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> )take on how the world works, and their desire to catch up
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> that's too many, and selfish ,indeed.... u just desperate n keep on trying another one right?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> its like if you decide to eat chocalate and then moan cuz u look too fat.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Do you know he loves you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> my wife forgives me for alot of things .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> FIRST YOU ORDER ONE ONLINE AND THE STORK BRINGS ONE TO YOU
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i would say around 3 or 4
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Imagine that i am that guy and be MY girl freind!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> give them a chance to discover you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> its unusal yes, but nothing bad.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I still love him what to do
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't just stay with him for the baby.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and never ignore her always listen to her...and when you do don't change the subjetct women hate that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> IT CAN BE GOOD LUCK ALSO IF YOU TAKE IT AS GOOD LUCK.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ITS a man thing live with it EGO
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Sounds like u r going through a lot right now.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Good luck but DO YOUR HOMEWORK!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't come here, it smells like a trap to me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Everywhere.... Just ask any girl passing by.... but ONLY IN THAILAND....  not in US .... lol
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> This gal does NOT want a bad boy at all.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But I need to be happy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you are so full of it, teasing all these desperate lonely sad sad guys, shame on you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Also sometimes guys think they dont need you so bad until your gone.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> only that i can say: good luck!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you married your hubby hopefully because you love him .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I LOVE TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS TO  THE LADIES WITH POEMS,  HAS ANYBODY WRITTEN ONE FOR A SPECIAL SOMEONE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Why tie yourself to just one guy?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> That's if u both agreed on doing this.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It's like saying, What's got to stop me when I have already done it?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he just has to start over and earn your trust again.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> One his side of his family I met his father.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> we fall in love  they treat us bad  why are we there
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i am one of those who want to wait until being totally in love with someone.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But try the nice way first..girls hate being ignored!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> keeping secrets only hurt the ones you love.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Some women like big hairy guys, some guys like fat women, some gals like skinny guys, and vice-versa.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> curves, esp if they have big boobs, and softness........can't beata soft woman
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> never tell her she's fat big one!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You are a MOM, Act like One!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> OTHERS LIKE THINK DUE TO SOCIETY DICTATES ITS; I SAY SCREW SOCIETY AND GIVE ME THICK!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> give them 2 months they will get over you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't know, but daniel K has never read manga.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I guess it's kind of nice, it's like your dad's blessing all the way.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I like intelligent,fun and hot girls.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> come to my town ill be your girl....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> This generation is just too stupid.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Yeah, time to cash in your chips.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> They are always in the 'in love' stage.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i see a malaysia air ad on tv and i go gaga.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it was really nice how he asked me out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> TRY TALKING TO HER AND ASK HER TO HANG OUT AS FRIENDS SEE IF IT GOES SOMEWHERE
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> (this is really hard because there are a lot of temptations out there).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Not what you can become just because she says too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> the two of you should talk privately and personally...you have to clear each other's side..do it now
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Well, the one I liked goes like this.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Do not try to have sex.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just keep it cool, a little hard to get might help!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if your relationship survive the four seasons... i guess you should be ready....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I married my guy anyways and do you know why (besides love).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> move on and find someone who doesn't hate you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> YOU CAN'T, so lets just start asumming it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yes we like flowers, pretty, good smelling ones
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> should i or shouldn't i. younger guy vs older woman
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ok, those other replies are just cocky, i'm way more FINE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> lime green would be more for a summer wedding.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but if they cannot exercise self-control, let them marry.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> My boyfriend snores and I have the most terrible time sleeping!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> May be u think not but Yes!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> WE HAVE NO ROOM FOR SCREWED UP ANIMALS LIKE THIS IN OUR SOCIETY.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> The best way and easiest way is to fly or drive to Las Vegas and get married there.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> his answer is good enough for me...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no single man can give you what you really want.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if he doesn't start acting right, then leave him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if yor hott too show him your boobies
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> a lot of guys like that - just looking for sex.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> (i mess up alot at times ) but she don't forget.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> WAIT FOR HIM TO ASK U OUT UNLESS UR REAL DESPRETE
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> u are asking do u like me
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Whatever  you decide, make it completly YOURS!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> her parents?u can't fix it... her friends?maybe u can talk to them nicely...but, pls specify , why?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> How drunk is this girl getting?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> gals luv guys with positive self image.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> am doing this just for the points lol
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if ya'll don't know anyting about each other u can't connect.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you do... then i would say it was a real and worth realtionship  :)    Good luck
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but really if you're used to it and you kinda like it, go with it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> cause it's buy one take one.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST--- does he always just happen to be staring...?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It sounds like a con, but i'm telling you, chicks dig it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you just have met the dumb ones out there that think skinny is better.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> However, i always believed in the fact there's a huge different between HAVING SEX and MAKING LOVE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You just have to make yourself walk away.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> in my case i think 80%
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> leaning in and giving me a soft kiss just on the forehead.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I can't see my life without my husband.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I do....much prettier and smooth as silk!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> :) Although, flowers are really nice even if they don't last.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it sounds like he is having too much fun while you are away.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> WHY don't you just leave the girl alone?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Maybe you should try dating girls if guys offend you so.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i also have not a single girl friend .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just remeber,     s go for guys who are themselves and ONLY themselves!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> they feel that they are better than womans but there wrong
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> That doesn't mean you should let them in.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It's always in the back of my mind.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> does she have other friends to gab with on the fone?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Getting married and getting child can wait but studies can't.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But you need to do this a few times.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> most teen boyz prefer girls that like sex.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't look back and enjoy the friends you have.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> NO GOOD OR BAD IS YOUR PERSONAL BELIEF ON SOMETHING.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and i dont know what i should do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yes it is a sick habit
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> wait till you get 25. you would not loose your charm by then.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> My bff hates my b/f and wishes for me to break up w/ him but I won't.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> RELAX AND BE REAL THAT IS WHAT WE LIKE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i dont think so, maybe they should try taking our last names
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You both should pick either his or yours once you have kids.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Of course HE wants to go on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> So I guess I pick domestic goddess.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Ask her out after class again.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and people life is to short live it to the fulliest and have faith
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I am man and I too feel so.... because I too am !!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> IF YOU LIKE HIM THAT MUCH,CALL HIM.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> start with a basic everyday question and go from there :)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> tell more ppl (my bor did)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> all my friends want to do is makeout!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> also actual kissing and asking if your a good kisser...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> we will not regret it.at ur service anytime.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> u need to reput it in add it back just like first time
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You can share this with ur mom or dad.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And don't fall for the alcoholic only on weekends line that the guy above is giving.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you sorta stuck yourself out thier to get hurt, unless you know him fairly well.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I prefer A & B cups, myself.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> be her friend first then see where it goes
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> dont even listen to what people not just guys say,  watch how they act.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> do u fell that way ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but if a guy asks u dont be afraid to say NO.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Obviously she don't want you if you know she likes the other boy!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> There are lots of things that make a woman not like sex.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Not all guys get bored and move on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> BUT --  There's no better person to marry someday than your best friend!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> depending on what yo uare looking for, freindship only, like.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i did this with my current boyfriend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But it doesn't mean you cannot love another.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just divorce that guy... he has no honour and he dont love you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> basicaly men just want to have girlfriend for free sex!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if nothing work ... u have to ask him for it again  :-)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> its ur PERSONALitie, keep to it, whether a guy goes out with u shouldnt determin how u act.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you have to search yourself for this one...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If the Guy is worthy enough, u wont need to
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I'm confused I hate the girl to be like that ... what shall I do ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> shop around for invitations and everything else!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he then asked me, can i come with you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just go with your feelings if you like her so much then go with it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> So I'm only myself around guys I dont like, and you know the outcome.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I hope you find a NICE girl.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ok i have liked this on girl since i was in ninth grade.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> To all my fellow girls at Cone, a big Hi and hug!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If shae like him then there is a reson .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If going to a movie is special for the 2 of you, then do that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It just sounds like u wear the pants.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> have you told her that it's kind of irritating with her having to check up on you everyday?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> for the same reason thin girls prefer slender tonned guys
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he handed me his cellphone and had me put in my phone number.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> GO TO HAWAII...HA HA HA OR ....PAY SOMEONE...LOL
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I don't understand why people think it's wrong.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Keep seaching for a believer in romance, she's out there!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you plan on cheating on your wife...you're a freaking pig and need to be shot!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Look, he already knows that you like him, and has he said anything bad about it?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> CONFRONT HIM AND ASK HIM THAT WAY YOU WILL KNOW
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it's more of a trust issue i'd say.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Never stop trying to impress her .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no , you are punish , and no tv for a month
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> LOL I think this is better than the one on top of me...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but that didnt bother me, because like i said wa&#92;e were just friends .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Go to school you can still come home or call your family and friends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> wow, go with the one that picks on you because 9 times out out 10 he likes you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I ALWAYS FELT THE SAME WAY, BUT I MET MY TRUE LOVE AND MY VIEWS CHANGED!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> take baths ?know how to speak ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I like him and he says stuff like, if i weren't dating _ i would go out with you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just get rid of him  you will be better off
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> The One time in your life to really live out the true fantasy of love!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> People asked me - whats the hurry?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Has he just dumped a girl and left before?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Needless to say, Im 36 now and STILL in therapy around it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and for God sakes DO NOT be one of those controling baby mama's.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Did you ever think of that?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> its been half a year- is it normal 2 still like him??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> look for a man that's hot!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It is realy sweet and just what u r looking for!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Is there a reason that your not w/the baby's dad?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> NO!NO!NO!IT CERTAINLY IS  MOST UNCOOL.U R SIMPLY WASTING UR HEALTH COS GIRLS JUST HATE IT.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> anything bigger than a handful is a waste, probably a size c or d
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I myself think that they do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> STOP trying to slap it in everyones face!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you should probably be looking in a public place where you are most comfortable.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ...a guy asks me, 'do you mind if we cuddle?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> or ask about the score of last game?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Because some couples NEVER get to that comfortable boring stage.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I always say that you shouldn't do things if your gonna regret them later.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Even the day after would be okay.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well all ur missing is a million dollar smile..:)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And I hear ya Fountain...same thing happened to me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> altho, i dont really like girls all that much.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Be really nice and give eye contact and smile a lot.. hope this helps!

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i can't help any more unless i have more infor.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> cause i say no on avatars
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Some girls prefer gifts that won't die on them...something that lasts.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he is probably wondering if your interested in him at all....flirt back!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I feel goofy, dorky, and happy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if your a hoe then he's one to...i personally don't think your one tho
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> so there are some guys that only say the L word if they mean it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I don't need a trophy girl I want a companion.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> As a guy - let me say this.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> BE CONFIDENT,ALWAYS BELIEVE IN YOURSELF.DO NOT BE ARROGANT THOUGH.ALWAYS MAKE GOOD EYE CONTACT.LISTEN TO WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Then he said do you want some of MY chapstick?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> there isn't a wrong or right way to kiss anyone.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> because we love them its not until later when we think about it that what we have done.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I would not know... i have the same issue.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> what was the mistake that you did
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It's like breaking a drug habit.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> tell him, and it wouldn't seem psycho cuz u have kno each other for a long time
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> hell yeah for the first answer.that girl answered for me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> or, what about blue and green?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> A life of your OWN....a life you've been missing out on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Confusing... yeah, i think your right.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Thing is, YOU DON'T HAVE TOO ASK HER OUT TO GO OUT WITH HER.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Maybe he's going to call you!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> OK, tell her, but be as polite as possible.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> in a park when i was 16 i lost my virgenate
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> What guy doesn't like big boobs.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you should be proud of yourself.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yeah ok men work and fix things but what else can you do?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> we dont no what you look like !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> IF YOU COULD HAVE 4 QUALITIES IN YOUR WOMAN, WHAT WOULD THEY BE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> look in the internet u will find lots of things for the wedding or your local newspaper or news
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if she sits on your bestfriends lap because she is drunk then yes it is a turn off.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> what shuld i do to get her ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Dude, you have to suck it up and introduce yourself.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> there are movies that i haven't seen yet.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i think it all depends on age, upbringing, .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And that will be just s*x!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> My boyfriend was definitely my friend first and it is total bliss!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> who gives a crap what anyone else thinks.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> also try getting some blonde highlights
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just let it all out, I use art a lot to vent problems that I have.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If she likes music, make a special cd or tape.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It could be  ( Choose one & why? )
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't worry what people will say.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I think a lot of girls like getting flowers.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i can't explain it...and no, it has nothing to do with them looking young, vulnerable or submissive.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Let him go... either that or date his brother!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Yes there are you just have to look.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> YOU CAN GET THEM IN STAPLES FOR $35
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Your Kid is going to have hard enough time growing up without a DAD.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> My friend says I am to nice and I should tell them no.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> My girlfriend always says she loves me when were passing notes during class, butshe doesnt say it confrontationally
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> That's right, the right relationship happened on it's own.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You will look like an idiot.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no and u shouldnt care.if u like him then stay with him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i thnk u shud b ur tru self, hav self esteem, self confidance
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Anything that is not nailed down!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> make it your top priority to see her if you really want to be with her that bad
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> one of my best friends had a thing with my big sister a few months ago.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Should I just forget it and move on?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> There friends on the other hand, thats a different story...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ummm yes i do i think anyone does!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> my cuzin met up with some wierd old perv saying he was a hot teen that she met online
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> none come in my list so i choose my neighbors wife :D
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I have long black hair and i love it,hubby loves it too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you care your family and everybody in your family will love you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Ugly (or fat) guys just take what they can get.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> in the middle of the river while there was ppl watching it was actually pretty fuuny!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> its all in the eye contact
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Depends on the guy some guys do some don't
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it kind of gives us an idea that you may not have strong guts.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i mean if u love him and he really loves u he may want to disapoint his father.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Yes some men get right down to it with absolutly no thought for the woman.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> maybe she's not a beeeatch and the skinny chick was
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it does sound a little girlie.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you want to enjoy a bit - why don't you check out some restaurants, night clubs, gyms etc
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> there are lost of good women left you just have to look in the right place.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Hey, its like, everyone's gotta seperate some day or the other.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you win some you lose some take it with a grain of salt and be more carefull next time
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> happy birth day to you .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i just need someone to help me figer this out
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> pick the 1 w/ better treatment towards u
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i'm into a 6th grade boy too!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you end it he might not be your friend thats why i dont go with friends
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> stick yourself out there more, you have to do far more than eye contact
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> do whats best for you and he
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> bad teeth , bad breath and bad bo.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no one needs to know that!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if i am to ask, i'll then leave, stop the relationship and move on with my life.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Hey, do not get me wrong.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I asked him if he still liked me and he said yes but he didn't act like it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Where am I going with this?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> keep getting her younger and younger guys as one gets old get a new one for her...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You know that's if u didn't play the guilt trip.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> That doesn't mean it makes it right, it means that it makes us human.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It is a mistake that can't be undone!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> practice unwrapping starburst with ur tongue, and tieing cherry stems w/ your tongue.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You catch her looking at you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I know 3 guys that I can probably get away with doing something like that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ask her out or tell her u like or admire her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if he's gonna be an on and off guy like that i say dump him 4 good!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If they dont then you'll have to get on with your life.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i have never been to it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> complement her...ask her name...dont act weird...act like u r the smoothest guy ever.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> she calls him all the time.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> is How should I approach her and be not just another guy hitting on her?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> wait a little while then date guys that way you enjoy it more.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Someone who's never 'bitchy' just because she thinks it's cool...it ain't.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> b/c you dont have any decision power what to do
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I know... Why should I hide it?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Some guys just don't like to dance.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Truly she isn't ur friend, b-cuzz she won't stop bugging u!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i wish i had listened to my friends
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> After how much time can you conclude that it takes too long and she isn't really interested?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> do i want to be in love?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Why do they want to be MARRIED???
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> No brainer  Oh and nice picture of George Clooney on your profile LMAO
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Some woman cannot seem to find guys their own age attractive.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> some do, but i would rather have a pair that were not too big
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It sounds like you are both comfortable with things just the way they are.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> so so sexy YES it look very nice on most any girl
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> sometimes its better to be very good friends first and make sure ur happy around each other
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Anyway my question is.... Will I always feel that way?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Listen to Faith Hill - Love Ain't like that            its a great example
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> child please, dont ask that question if you dont want your feelings hurt
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And the gf should accept that about if she loves you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I think it's totally hot when a guy shaves his legs.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If u guys still keep in touch---I dont think thats the best thing to do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i like this boy austin and i told my friend claudia to ask hin if he likes me
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> YOU ARE KILLING THE ROMANCE BY POPPING UP THAT STUPID QUESTION, ever thought of having fun together instead?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> He's a player...no good trust me...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it depends they all like different 1's but not selfsenterd freaks like u
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i think thats fantastic, maybe you should do the first move!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> IF he tUrNS YoU dOwN, HES NOT WORTH IT IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well just go up to her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It's a good idea to always be honest...besides not many guys I know don't like being told they're hot!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> They know the women will not chase them like good looking or wealthy men who get tons of chicks.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just face him, say Hey I like you wanna see a movie?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> thats why they call it making love.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Smile to him once in a while...then he will know...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> most girls are polite she'll answer it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i would... you sound alot like my best friend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Say hey(whateverhisnameis) when ya taking me to dinner???
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it really depends on the guy but i think most guys seriously don't care.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you want it to work out it will .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If he doesn't want to dance, then give it up.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But you know what, I feel the guy should make the first move.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> without having a boyfriend would be a bit slutty.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> WAIT take it from a military girl WAIT!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you never know gurl they never show efection only when they want somthing
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i am 49 yrs of age and looking for a beautiful woman to spend my time with and possibly?????
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> do you mean seem more sexy?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> go to deleted items and it should be there
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> THIS IS A RED FLAG OF HOW THIS GUY IS.I WONDER!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> may be becaues your name is freakgirl but if you show your face maybe not no hard feelings
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> that would be sooo painful you know,trust me been there done that!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Do U love her in depth?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Have fun in jail asking that question to your cell mate.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ;) nah the only time u see a man emotional is when he is with his lady luv!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yes i have done it it was a lot of fun.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Gotta let the person you are with know what u want.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Ofcourse, if she calls like 5 times a day about that, then it would be crazy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> HANG IN THERE FOR ONE THAT APPRECAITES YOU.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> my mom books them all of the time pat@alanatvl.com
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> besides don't you think he has enough to worry about?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ive been dating this guy that's younger than me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Men play at love to get sex, women play at sex to get love.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it's got to get played out after a while.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Everybody likes to be told that they're hot, even if they don't admit it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yes but it dipends of the guy
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Mabey because ou just think they look sexy when they are running on the feild
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Your too young to be talking about kissing already.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i prob will tell her soon cuz shes my best friend ha well any help would be nice.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i agree with the other preson before anyone gets hurt
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I'm ready to move on, but I love him way too much!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Go out & do EVERYTHING you couldn't when you were with him/her!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Obviously, men ain't much better ;-)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> What if you tell him that you just want to be friends with benefits.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> play a truth or dare game together
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he sounds like a manipulative jerk.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> slow down the pace maybe, fourplay,
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Death is like a big black bag full of of crack or smack or meth.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> PRACTICE KISSING ME  WERE DO YOU LIVE?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no you wont huni......i was married to a complete arsehole!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> sounds like you really love her...no need to forget her!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> tell him that u jst wannabe friends and that u r relly disappointed that he would act so dumb!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It always finds a way to get out in the open, just don't do it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and yuck, what is with chest hair?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> as for now i think he is mad, hurt, upset and got over you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Give your brother some money and tell him to take a hike!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no offense, but it kinda sounds like a girls name ya know but no disrespect intended!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> be cool and ask her on a date!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well after u take her out get to know her some and then go 4 the kill,ask her out
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> People don't like to be played yo-yo with.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> practice to unrap starburst wrappers with your tounge, the girls love it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I don't know!...I just want the points...lol
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> that's not exactly true.... it's just that most girls are discreet about it...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> THAT DEPENDS...ARE YOU A HOTTIE W/A BODY?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I told him it was too late...other than that, I wouldn't have minded getting flowers sometimes.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> believe in is a strange way to put it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Why can't men (or boys in your case) ever say the word LOVE?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just enjoy the age you are and don't worry about all this.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> though i'm 19, i like anything up to 30?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i had a friend in the same situation.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> girls are just as perverted--trust me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You shouldn't go out with a guy because you 'need' to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Dude, what your sayin is she doesn't want to be more than bf and gf?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> IS IT USUALLY ABOUT A YEAR BEFORE BOTH PEOPLE BEGIN 2 FEEL IN THAT COMFORTABLE,BORING, STAGE??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Probably because I knew all the girlfriends were not really the one until I met my wife.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i think as long as you dont base your relationship on sex its ok
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But some guys would do that...   WHY?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if your the average guy breast size shouldn't matter.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Stay far far away from guys who can't say I LIKE YOU.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yea ask for permission by all means and watch how fast she slap the s--- out you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Honey my husband likes me for me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> my mom also has cancer and this just hits to close to home for me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> then be your best self, if he's impressed or likes you he'll talk back
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you dont want anyone else but that person ever
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> why don't you try chatting/seeing other guys just to catch his reaction?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> BUT IT IS OKAY TO KISS ON THE FIRST DATE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> guys have a problem with secrets.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I had someone get nasty with me because I was still dating?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> So how do i just kiss him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I am the maid of honor for my only sister and I want it to be perfect!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> unless it's with the wrong man.
