<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> when he knows im not looking he will stare at a woman and check them out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i would probably break up with him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> woman wants some challenge, not just a guy she can walk all over him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> is because nobody has done it to then so they dont know how it feels.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> we are better liers than guys are...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't you have guys you like that you don't date?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if your not hiding things, showing her should cause fewer fights than not showing her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> My problem is, I always see others as the way I want to see them...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> to get over him just play with guys
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> “I know he’s a jerk but he says he wants to be with me.”
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> dump him...your wasting your time if you stay with him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if a guy/gal can't be honest with you then forget him/her!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It's just gonna remain a mystery to all!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ?I promise I won't bring my friends along!...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> She knew I was there & I love her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> otherwise if you slowly appproach...her body language will let you know
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it doesnt mean he doesnt love you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> crushing on a guy, and knowing he likes me too?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Ya the dark hair, dark eyes, and skin...they are rumored to have nice butts too!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Either he's really super busy or he's a PUTZS!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> hang out with him a couple times and see what he is like
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> The waves in boracay normally dont get that big eventhough its raining...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> They are just dreams you know.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and am i always going to have to struggle to make ends meet.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If that doesn't work, talk to a friend (not about him)!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> do you have a pic page or something.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Honestly, I LIKE guys that haven't been with a lot of other girls.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> YOU ARE THE SCUM OF THE EARTH!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just means that they aren't playing games with their sexuality.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Nope, but who is really happy anyway?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it's easy to say yes, but i have a feeling it would be tough to do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> u don't need to worry about that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> There is no way that that's the problem.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> doesn't mean he's puttin' the moves on elsewhere but I would be suspicious !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well do not show off that is a turn off and will give the impression ur cocky.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Realize mom and dad are happy being apart.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> So how do I get it to come out again?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> your a guy love is a very wierd thing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Or whatever, he's a dumb guy anyway!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if it doesnt mean anything then y is she goin out w/ another gurl ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Please ,don't do this,you deserve nmore.You can  but don't.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> or that he would like to see you wear, and then go back and buy it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> dont force it because you might make a mistake.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Why should she miss anyone who in the first place wasnt hers?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no, because my breast to big
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I see it online everywhere.. i was just wondering
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> not very sexy if you ask me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> talk this one out girl before you make a bigger mistake...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just come in front of her and tell her that you are the man of her dreams!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well how old are u and i would like to be ur friend
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Yes get out of there quick
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> they just think differantly than you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just move on with your life and find someone else.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i think you got a boyfriend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> the one i had with your mom.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> do any other girls feel the same..?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't you really mean, how many minutes into the first date????
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i like him but i don't know if he likes me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> sometimes it dosnt matter if you no how to use it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> what kind of friend are you looking for?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> how much does your balls sweat?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but lately he avoids me & wont even talk to me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Dance for him with something sexy!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i like girls with nice personalities
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I like school teachers...but I'm not one.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but sometimes he acts like he still does.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> depends how far you would let me go...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he obviously is trying to hit another girl so i would back off.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And have a happy Valentines Day!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Always happy...waking up this morning...at work now.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Have I told... you lately that your cuuuuuuuuuuuutee!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> keep your head high and dont give up hope if things dont work out!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> There are some good country boys out there that would love to have a good country girl!!)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Ask her out on a casual date.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and DO NOT  encourage your girlfriend to become a stirpper.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> because that description surely screams FLIRTING!!!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yeah my boyriend is crazy abou my toes!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you love someone then you sacrifice being with other people.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Good luck and have a nice day!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> When I had sex with a guy who worked like a machine.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Do he still like me r is he playing games
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you love someone it's because who the are not because the color of their skin
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> There isnt supposed to be any false love...so I guess true love is just a euphemism
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you only want your ex then leave the rest alone.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Theres no need to keep playin games.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ur probably so d*mn ugly he has no choice but to look.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just tlak to her ask her out to dinner or something like that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If she likes you - great.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Come on yaar its ok now.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just be like Hey Lets Kick It Some Time!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> First of all dont call then stupid and ugly because they like u.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Maybe he thinks its your fault that u have a baby.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You can't really tell that soon, I don't think.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If she is getting jealous then their must be a reason why.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> He needs to see what it's like firsthand.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> find me for alot of fun!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no but he see u more bitful at night cuz ur father is sleeping lol
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I bet you are a beautiful person and should not be gealous of it...go out there and have fun!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't let these girls lie to you!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> a question that left you busting up laughing
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> YOU ARE TRUELY A SAD CASE!!!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and you can even tell him why if he ask.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> What if the people were guys?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Girl, it's not going to last, go out and have fun!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no, don't ask him, instead push his buttons so that he asks you out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> maybe because you are differant than every one else!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> best way is LOOK STRAIGHT INTO HIS EYES and u will get the answer
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Besides... do we really want our moms to be liars?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> TELL HIM IN HIS LOVE LANGUAGE (WE ALL HAVE OURS)  Find out his love language and speak it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Do you really want to spend the rest of you life with someone like that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Everytime I talk about it he says I am pushing him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i would think that he is having sex with someone eles.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> SOMETIMES I COME BACK TO MY HOMETOWN TO GET AWAY WHICH IS ACROSS COUNTRY TO WHERE HE IS.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> remember that this guy needs to help pay for your expenses, too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> lol   you juos laugh out loud and you should feel better
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> He is a guy what do you expect
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> could be, it sounds like he like he likes being around you... you never know!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> y does the skin color matter??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Get over yourself and go to that wedding!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> My e-mail is jakb6hsm@yahoo.com  I like new friends
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if a black man breaks into my house is it fair to say most black people are criminals!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't be a wimpy, winey, wuss.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I like the woman to be loud though!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If he has money and isnt a kreep stay!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> cheat on you then write a note.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you ask him I dont think he would lie to you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Have a good life, don't let him way you down.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> the guy you are talking to is a psychopath, a control freak.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> So that next day I went with my boyfriend out to eat to the place we were going to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But there is no guys in this town (worth dating)!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I want her, to want me....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You shouldnt think that because then everyone will think u are stupid( like me.)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Did his boss give him a hard time...?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and she just has this constant fear.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Beautiful girls can be found everywhere, just look around you!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> because distance makes lies harder to hide.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> here i expect he will go to jail even though you say it was mutual.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> by the way, all those commercials saying, condoms don't always protect, well, something is better than nothing!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if its a different one each week i doubt it... but check the signs: eye contack and flirting
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> should i break up with her or go with it and trust that she really loves me ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Dont ever go to places that u used to hang out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> SHOULD I GO BACK OR STAY HOME?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But dont feel  bad or hurt if he tries to put you down,Life is long.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Yea u love him but u wanna risk him gettin sumthin an bringin it back ta u?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Most guys aren't really stupid, you're just meeting the wrong people.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I think its a big myth that guys are just big, retarded sex fiends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> EVEN THOUGH IT'S OKAY, YOUR PARTNER NEED NOT KNOW EVERYTHING YOU THINK ABOUT.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Unless it was a good dream, of course.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If he want to just be friends , it's best to move on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> WHAT COMES AORUND GOES AROUND SWEETHEART.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Depends on the man OF COURSE!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it's very easy just buy him a flower and say that you love him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Say Adios to her, life is waaaayyyyy too short!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> u know we do it too!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> The boy is 14-16 years old and he likes me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But if you decide to go for it....HAVE FUN!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> theres not much you can do if a guy does not want a relationship w you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> do things that makes you happy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It depends on the girl i guess, but i lie all the time and people really buy it :)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> the best town is ur imagination because if thats all you want you will never get anything
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> its not good to date them all
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Ever heard of a pajama party????
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Guys do like it when girls can spell (or at least aren't too lazy to look words up).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> riza if you dont know why, then why answer for all you know its some creep
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I've been there it the place is really great...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> As for the guy just try to ignore him and eventually it will be forgotten!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but to answer your question no there is no way to understand men.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just wanting to meet friends in Amsterdam
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> she act like she doesnt like so what should i do date here or leave her alone
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you try to take it slow, no guy like to hear that he is a bad kisser.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> That is like asking if love ever existed... Not everyone is bad.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> !are you some kind of schizoprinia?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> what do you like bieng asked?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Do crazy stuff like cover yourselves in whipped cream or something tasty.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> dont jsut wait for something good to happen.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> like he is really cute then what do you do then
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> threaten him by saing ur going to call the police if he doesnt pay child support!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> even if they laugh at the time.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I'm not sure what to do
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> first and formost, for him just to say so shows the kind of man he really is.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if its because you like someone else- say that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> they are unwise and mean and they are gonna have to learn the hard way.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> makes 4 quick access i guess?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> He got waaaay too many girl friends help me im confused!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i say right on to being a virgin it is a really big sin to not be a virgin.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you can stop trying to control her life?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> why would a guy want to go out with an frigid ice princess such as yourself.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i'm just trying to avoid any quarrels... she gets jealous pretty easily!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Some men are scared of marige, and stuff so a good talk might help!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> So men, why would you or wouldnt you date a virgin?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Because when they think their head hurts because they have no brain!And   boys are just  boys!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Why so many men dream about living with an asian girl.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But i guess it really depends on if you want an emotinal attatchment.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> close your eyes and do your thing
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Once a cheat, always a cheat...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> talk to me-- you can't be that lonely !!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Anger makes you say YOU CAN'T HURT ME ANYMORE!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Because, in all honesty, that is SO sexy just in itself.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> get with somone more in tune with your maturity level
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I would not be attracted to her in the first place
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> its healthy and natural,but if you dont becareful you can get some nasty viruses!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And take a good look in the mirror.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he got what he wanted... he is done with you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> most guys, as you probably know, are horny all of the time.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I would also question how much of a friend is your best friend??????
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you're considering taking him back DON'T.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Send him a message from ur mobile!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> god moves in many ways ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> when u r at least 16
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> He loves you for being HIS only!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> omg i had the same problem look at the awnsers i got.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And your time and YOUR life!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he'll understand and think nothing of it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Hope that helps (if even a little).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Please try to remember this: The leading cause of DIVORCE is GETTING MARRIED!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If he is unwilling to lick it then don't let him stick it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i wish then you would have no problem getin laid(@)(@)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yeah... i did that and it SUCKED!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You just cannot force yourself on anyone or you will not have anyone.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you are not growing and having fun, then the relationship is DEAD.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I also have that problem but if your nice in bed, I'm pretty sure she won't even notice.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> get her things that actually mean something.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Depends on how old are you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Having younger friends will help make up think & feel younger =)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> say back off bitch i hate u
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I don't think the hubby desearved to have it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you get in life what you pay for.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Yeah its possible...it happens a lot to me
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> No, I'm a girl, I only think about sex if I'm realy in love of some guy
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If he's cheating then kick him to the curb.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And think of this if you think of NOTHING else...S-T-D's he may bring one home to you!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no there is no way that girls will EVER understand guys.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Party it up while your young.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i heard your geting married, when it is ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Try some honesty, it works for me
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Him asking you out is up to him, you blew it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but i absolutely love italian women!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> still trying to figure that one out myself
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If she's really, really ugly, then yes - not having sex is very beneficial.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> why their more exciting sports are the ones with a lot of contact?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> once you have moved on then you wont care if he moves on or not.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> first of all, that's not typical of a guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but most woman talk about it for sure, there are noveltie parties with sex toys.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> except that didn't end too great... :(
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> think about it before that way you wont get tunge tied
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> do it when you are married
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> she does it again, shame on you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> okay so about 3 months ago this all started with flirting.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> go out with ur ld friends to meet other new friends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> He will accidently run into u out & about.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if she is aromantic, get her some flowers and chocolate eventhough valentines day is over.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I don't know about you but I don't like the bad boy type.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> (sung as off key as possible)  silly songs are the way to go!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Maybe even try to hook him up with a friend!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I found someone at a strip club whom I married.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but I may whant it more then guys.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> they actually have younger brains than we do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> him nd i met through a friend(his bro.)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you should think it through very good.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Yes there are, I am not one of them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> hello how are you?what you neam?i just want friend in  amsterdam please send to me sincarely shaba
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I'm not a prude at all, i love oral sex, porn, i'm good looking.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just like most of the time guys dont understand girls.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Your bestfriend is not a friend if he had sex with your girl.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i dunno.. maybe i'm just not born 2 lie 2 much.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> The least she could say is no.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I think about sex non-stop, and even more than all of my guy friends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it feels bad and sad ok bye
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> is sad how some people are..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> listen to the song baby baby stay gone by jimmy wayne.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I dont even talk to other guys.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If that doesnt work I dont know what to tell you because it works for me sometimes
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If she already has a guy then you just have to set your sights elsewhere.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You back up everything you say to her it's pretty simple
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if it doesnt fit in the mouth
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ask him if he likes your kids if he dont thin brack up beceas family comes 1st.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> U can tell by the way they look at u and the way the person talks 2 u
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i have been to a few.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Not all gals, but some do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i would stop calling and see if he misses you and calls you!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ur future is not bright it;ll leads u to death.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> What are indications of a man flirting?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> WHY SHOULD U KILL THAT INNOCENT BABy
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> your guess is as good as mine.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well mine is 8 to 9 inchs
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Remember bill gates was probably dateless and considered ugly and stupid and look at him now.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> strike 1, he no like kids.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Best friends always come before girls.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> A girl who loves him and cares about him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> don't run he is just talking.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> keep that, you may find he is a really cool guy and want to stay friends
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If this guy says no he won't help.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ignore it when people start rumors.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you find out how let me know.GOOD LUCK
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> No,  I am not soft, just trying to be fair.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Dude, I hate to say it but she was cheating on you with this guy before you broke up.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i invited her over and we went inside my room and i shut the door lol.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Theres this hella hot guy in my neighberhood.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i am a gemini actually but honestly spiking i dnt bliv in horoscopes.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it's the only thing real serious ladies are serious about.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> instead of a girl u should get a guy for your own likings
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But i enjoy necking and even a little caressing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And I don't really think too much about it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't say to much stuff.Say hi!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> hold your head up and smile.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> All I can say is Don't Look Back.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> is it ok for me to have sex with my gf?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you have a baby then the baby has a daddy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i went to clubs and that was just for a fun night.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> So thats ur answer yes they say that wont cheat....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> would have sex with more than one guy at once?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> personally i dont think that that is useful.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> what if you're interested in a lady, but not sure if she is in you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> when your boyfriend dose not im u or call u for 3 weeks what would u do
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but if you have to ask you are probably too young or immature to really get married.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yes because almost all men are like that
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Its all up to you.Just dont look too hard.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it does not mean good things for you as far as dating her goes.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> My guy friends all say confidnece (not arrogance though) is sexy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well, emmm... maybe you can call her or work really hard to earn some money and buy a car??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Sleep with his brother, or best friend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Or you could spred rumors about her where ever you are.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't send an IM that says ASL?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> im telling you this from personal experience.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but woman do talk about it alot!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> she did it once, shame on her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it can even help your relationship
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> SO SPILL THE BEANS AND LET IT FALL WHERE IT LANDS.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i saw them last year they were great etc
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> do you really want someone that doesn't know what he wants?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Let her try on a sports bra.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> tell her that you love her and try to find money,,,,,,
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> (you all know you were thinking it!!)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I don't know you to love you!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> stop having sex with him which you should not be doing in the first place....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you get bored easily when with him/her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You know your man, if you trust him don't worry.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You know what you should do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ask him about it, if he denies it, and u no he is cheating, dump him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If he/she really made u happy u would be glad to sayback off not flirt.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Oh, and as good as it may sound, dont do anything for Valentines Day!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> the gay guys love listening to them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if he did call it was atleast once a week.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> most guys arent stupid, u just associate with the stupid ones
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I would say that is not okay because just because hes a guy doesnt mean that its right!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> My wife said it just depends on her mood at the time
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Well if u are really lookin for advice... Don't do it...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> First of all don't do anything that you don't want to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Is it coz he doesnt trust me?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> YOU ARE YOUNG ....YOU NEED TO TALK TO YOUR MOM ABOUT THAT...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Sorry its always gona be aucword and kinda weiro ish.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i just want some good love songs to listen to i know it's kind of sappy but whatever
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Divorce is not something that kids like.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> tell her there's something you've been wanting to tell her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I can't believe he is telling you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I believe being with someone is the best!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and this is the first time I ever had to do anything like this for anyone..PLEASE HELP ME!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Keep it that way no matter how mad she gets.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> that's a stupid question to ask, if you don't know you never will.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i dont live there so couldnt tell ya sorry
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ask her why she in the relationship and how she feel about you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I like it from the back!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> they like it up on top or bent over bow-wow style!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> follow ur heart...wat feels rite 2 u?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't let some other girl get a chance with your crush.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> love without sex and sex after marriage is best
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If I can't stop thinking about the guy I like, I just focus hard on my work or read.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> good question i'm a girl so us girls  will never know!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> that has 2 be the worst thing to do to your friend roght now!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you dont like him, you like his friend,why not tell him?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Hope you get some new friens soon...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> unfortunately if you have to ask, probably.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> are u wanting to get married?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Sex is Like Air & Water.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't give him too many chances.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well... if you like her guess it is ok.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I know he loves me even more because I was still a virgin on our wedding night!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But I would not agree that girls should attack first!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Depends on if you are a girl too or not.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> As a guy, I know that many...no....the majority of guys are in relationships for there own personal gain..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> try this, did this person have sex with their spouse before they got married?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> is that a question for a guy?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Try looking someplace besides the losers section.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> give him a chance and some time to get to know your children.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well it depends..   how old r u & how old is ur mom???
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you are even asking this question, i think you are probably too young to be getting married.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> wait and see what she has to say.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ease into it, don't just jump on him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It is called, He's just not that into you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I can tell ya one thing if you cheated on her Goddess help you soul!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you have to be confident flirt with us a lil but be sweet too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> don't have sex w/ him and see what he does...haha great advice i know!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but i really really like him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if u agree with him no prob but wot do u feel?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Most of all - HAVE FUN!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> However, that doesn't mean it's over.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I know he wouldn't want me to either!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> they don't have to be christian to cheat the women do it too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Iam Sure They Think The Same Thing About Girls.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> to show sumone actions or phrases in like of that person
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If he did, he wouldn't cheat.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but we never got together, because i was with his best friend *matt.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> As long as he really doesnt know the chicks it wont matter...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And you should be very respectable about it to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ok he is 14-16 and you are how old??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I CAN'T BELIEVE I WASTED YEARS OF MY LIFE BEING WITH TRASH LIKE YOU!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i'm just looking to spice things up in my room...what should i try?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but that takes time to develope.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> honey just come right out and tell him about the phone call.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You said it yourself hes in love with another lady!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i would hit it even if she was still dripping from his sex
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> my friends can't stand him and constantly picks on him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and let your personality shine through and dont be fake, girls can sense that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> thats funny u asked that cuz i kinda felt like that about a girl once, cant really explain why.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> get used to guys that just want to use you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It's Fate that does that :)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> my moms friend willy lives there...find ppl on myspace...theres tons of ppl from everywhere
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> grab a male who you never met and have sex or get married right at that moment.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> a picnic lunch in a beatiful, quiet, private setting.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> wanna be careful you don't end up in that hostel..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if its something you enjoy then whats wrong with that?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> when you want to give him a bear hug everytime you see him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> everything reminds me of him and wat used to be.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Its So natural, why make issue out it?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i just broke up with my gf but its harder to get another one can u help me
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Did he do it on purpose???
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i was thinking about how to kiss her next time:)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but this girl i really do love.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> As long as she isn't thier boss.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> A not circumcised penis is pretty nasty!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> from my on experince it depend's on the both of you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ....if she doesn't like you enough to remain only with you, it's not worth it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i'm 13 years old and 5'10.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> have a fun and interessing honeymoon!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> my bf notices so many girls when hes driving and he tries not to make it obvious.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I hate those kind so remember money can buy lots of things apart from class, style and grace
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> DONT TAKE ACTION, CUZ SHE'LLGET HERS EVENTUALLY.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Oh, and if guys knew u said that nobody would like u, just so u know.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> life is like that, everyone hurting each other.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I lost my virginity at the age of 17, I honestly didn't know what the hype was all about.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just ask him if he would mind if you sent such pics.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no but you should take care of it before you try to get preganant
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If he says its nothing, tell him you're not stupid.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Did you not say for better or worse.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Anytime he says Come here  , there you go right behind him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> To my Bestsest friend (x infinity 2) your friend forever I LIKE CEREAL ^-^
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> A BABY CAN'T DECIDE IF IT WANTS TO LIVE OR DIE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It makes me feel good about myself when other guys hit on me and flirt with me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> One said, I can't leave my kids, the other said, why do you want to have coffee with me!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> where is he working.. how many hours... ask him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> 18 i think no need to rush though.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Some guys really dont like any playing with their bums.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Women are a mystery, and we like it that way!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> however i really do love her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i don't think he doesn't trust you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I like this one guy who used 2 be in my class.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I just like to get some advice.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Isn't it torture for one and ego for the other ...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> tell them you love them, and see if they tell you back
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> that's who we r it's in r blood and there is nothing u can do
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Im soooooooooooo loud we got complaints from our neighbors... no joke
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well one day i sat him down and told him i liked him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Be blunt... Hey, you guys going to let me in on the conversation or what?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he will defnetly get it at one point
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if this boy like you you should go with him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> pick me but be a little more specific on type or stereo i mean age counts too!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no one can control their dream.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Haven't you seen the Paris Hilton video YET?!!?!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Trust me, guys don't know what's best for a girl.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Go out with one of his friends and see how he takes it...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> she says that it doesnt mean anything and that is every guy's dream.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Or hang out with best buddies, take your mind off of him, have fun, girl.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i cant answer that coz i havent experienced it..  but i think its possible
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I think she just wants to come to America like everyone else...but thats just me...peaceout !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> He probably thinks it's a good thing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> the admiration s not enough reason to kiss
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and crying is ok....but talking is more productive.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Knocked up girls lose intrest that way.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> talk to the guy and figure out wut made him act like such a jerk
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Would I date a stripper, probably not.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you no longer want to see his/her face.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> He didn't care if he knew!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> some guy was following me in a store and said i never liked levi's jeans until now, i ran.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> they used to be best friends, but now they arent.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I want to be myself but not scare her away, what should i do?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it sounds like you're more hung up on virginity than most guys would be.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just tell him without having sex with him and you won't come over being cheap!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> she never got over you the first time...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> y do u marry him when he's quiet and noe u want him to talk to u?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Be young - have fun... Don't take life so seriously.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> sorry but no, get a job
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> No if your over 40 you might as well be 80
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i dont like to hurt anyone.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no, he just likes to talk to you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Your 3 year already has a daddy
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> All i really want is my ex to realize that i only want him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Find some Barry White stuff, it works.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you could find the most beatiful natural blonde and tall girl in this world but she wouldn't be smart!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Looking back, I am not really sure why I did it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> maybe cause u sound so sorry
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> be honest... ask him what he thinks... its a good way to start dont you think?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i kind of ruined jons friendship with matt.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It probably wasn't the brightest thing for him to tell you, but I wouldn't worry about it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i like this one guy *jon & he used to like me too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and to top it all off, i didn't get to come, cuz that headboard thing lost the whole mood.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I'd give you 100pts for that one!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> they have lots of great suggestions on there.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> start talking about kids around your parents
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Um...I didn't...I let the man come to me and ask me out!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I found out my gf was really a boy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> she knows she has to move on but she can't....any ideas that might help her out?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you just answered your own question.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> CAUSE THEY THINK THERYRE POPULAR AND HOTT AND THEY JUST ARE WHEN IT COMES TO DATING
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> for the majority it is quiet unless it is super goooooooooooood then i will be loud
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> some are 'snugglers', some are not.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't be dumb like I have been.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But I'm not the one who did anything wrong.I love him so much what should I do?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and i say this because its true.....Its not the only thing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> jon & i used to be really close & talk all the time about anything & everything.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> or he tells you he doesn't wanto do it rigth now?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Then i started smoking and drnking.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Why waste your time on someone that would disrespect you in that way?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> IF GURLS DONT LIKE U FOR THAT they HAVE PROBLEMS
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> can't he get a girl to share hers with him?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> my advise: dont go out with a stranger.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Be honest ....with him, and yourself,do you really want him back?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> go to iraq and keep in touch.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> at times i think only sex.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> when a girl likes u, u should be able to kno HELP ME GIRLS!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> They Just want to be loved
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> a compromise position is to refuse to hang out with her when she's been drinking.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But he tells me that they dont mean anything to him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> MOVE ON girl@ go have fun!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I think you just lust for him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Also tell him you had a bad experience with another guy that tried some stuff and made you mad.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> No, seriously..  DON'T get him another dog!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> for me a girl beein mature!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Was I not attractive to him that night?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he doesn't love you, break up with him and don't even listen to his excuses!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i'd work with him some more.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Believe me, sweetheart, people are not always who they first appear to be.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you cant stop it..its like a reflex and we are just prone to do it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I for one dislike fake boobs.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> that's how life works... there will always be ups and downs in your life... just accept it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> YOU HAVE TO TAKE A STAND.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But your bf isn't you bf.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i started likin some1 i didnt before when they asked me out so just ask.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Can I get custody even though he has been a stay at home dad?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> men want ladies out in public, and sluts at home in the bedroom.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Give him a bl*w job once in a while.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Maybe a hot bath for both of you!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Go intoroduce yourself, smile, be nice to her...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> are u matuer enough to handle a serious relationship?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> when women get togeather thats one of the main toppics.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Odds are you wouldn't get married anyway so find someone new!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> because we make them nervous and their brains jus go out the window!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> BECUASE THEY USUALLY JUST LIKE TO MAKE YOU FEEL BAD.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and they are more romantic.. that what i think..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you are too young and too many things can go wrong.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Theres a reason why dis happened So jus be patient...evry cloud has a silver lining *Hugs*
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Remember, just because a guy knows your involved, doesnt mean he wont try anyway.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i wouldnt even loose 5 seconds on a girls thts a MAJOR hotty and still STUPID!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yes it is beneficial to not have sex.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well if you wanna meet some hot mama citas i would go to the library or maybe walmart.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> in the meanwhile continue to flirt, care or adore him and better still know him!!

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> pretend to be a girl looking for a NSA relationship and IM him..:P
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and he thought I enjoyed myself.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> she tells me that she really loves me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Count me in for that :)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> only if u guyz r best friends
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> He didn't love you, know how I know?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> your charming smile baby, which costs nothing
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> dont care about them just leave them cz trust me u wont get anywhere with these people
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> sex with love of course... you have to love that person you are making love with... it`s really important...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> when i catch him staring at a woman he denies it and yells at me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't let a man walk all over you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Jesus - why not POKE every man's EYES OUT?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it means that u've got a new little sister!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I am 26 and I waited until I was married to have sex.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yes its ok, everyone is attracted to other people.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Do guys even think that is cute/sexy?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> 2.If a guy cheats you are hanging out with the wrong men.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> so you like a lesbian and your not a lesbian that makes no sense what so ever
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but now he ignores me again.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> buy her a rose bouquet for v-day and ask her out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> IM me now on yahoo messenger using my ID :pao_sky2000
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Get lost  i need two points sry i am being a b****     not
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i've got this friend and she's going gaga over this guy who doesn't like her back.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you dont want to lose him as a friend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> get some cool electronics out of the deal.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> start showin him more lovin attention!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> may god and your fellow soldiers preserve you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but you aren't really asking anything here.....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> most will if they get the chance but your not married so .............its about 99% i think
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i agree with rockhead  don't tell anyone
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you should have sex when you're horny.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you get even by becoming a better person then you were before you met her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> 2. my 1st time (& last) time having sex while watching telivision.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> u cant get married in jail
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> why don't you just email him your question?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> because most of them are horny assholes that can't get any.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> LOOK AROUND YOU EVERYONE IS BEAUTIFUL
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> see how it goes from there
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> u are surfing the net..yahoo answers obviously!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i dunno..i just know that i just gained 2pts.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Dump him, just because you love him ...doesn't mean he love you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> because pain is pleaser, & when one bleeds it's like an orgasm!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no, but that is because guys have different horomones than girls do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ha ha that stuff is all true thats how i get sometimes...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I wouldn't take it that seriously, it's only a dream.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> That means you can have your cake and eat it too!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it's time to move on...maybe it hurts but that's life.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Dont hurt him but dont hurt yourself either...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it's just the way of life
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> We're not talking about flirting as in playing dumb.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> when my girlfriend bit my cock off and ate it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you tend to love the person more when you have sex
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> SO theres a lot more out there then what is happening right now.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> u can hold a 12hr coversation witha boy just talking about himself.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> 1. marriage is not a joke!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you like him go out with him why the hek do you have to ask  here?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i never thought i would get asked out but i did.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If i like a guy i ask him out before another girl out him out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> hahahaha yeaah right like I am going to post that kind of personal info
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Sounds like a break up to me........
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> MY BOYFRIEND OF ALITTLE OVER A YEAR NOW HAS CONTINUED TO LIE TO ME THROUGHOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> its the same reason mine is.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yup..as long as he love you den its not a problem anymore..loves doent mean money..dun judge it by money
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> she will always be there 4 you ,care about you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I fell to my knees, I won't ever forget that weird moment.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but she doesnt trust me cause ive said similar things to both of them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I garantee that all the girls that think they think about sex a lot have no effin idea.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just be original.That's all you gotta do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if your in a relationship with one, you better think it over  if she is worth all the pain.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Why don't you get a job, and then you'll have money of your own.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> because they are to in love and they think that theres hope
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> oooh....thats a tough one....just go out with her friend then shell want you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Is sex soooooo good that people are willing to risk so much??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Best revenge: move on with your life and forget that the cheater ever existed.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It's like your happy most of the time and you're always glowing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> (careful if hes a non-understanding homosapien)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> becaue my train of thought ran off the track and bumped all other men's off to
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> YOU CANT AND I WOULD BE DISRESPECTFUL TO THE MINISTER
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if it hurts, and the woman can't take it, it's way to long.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I think it's time to for you to move on...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> got a good cast iron skillet?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Any man who doesnt like kids is  a coward to responsibility !!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Dat was bad....... never again TV will be on during Sex.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> tell her if she loved you she would come over and fuck your brains out and swallow your kids
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you can't take it to be his friend then leave him alone
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you feel the best feeling uve ever felt in your whole life
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but only when theyare in the mood or if you spice the moment.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and what does it stands for?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you can (and its about love), its probably good.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> not all guys it depends on the guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yes it is but are you in love?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> because red is blody color but we sey blue is LOVE
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> they end up thinking you`re a total bastard.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> As long as that person  says it's OK.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> especially if your used to having sex on a regular basis.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Or maybe someone is trying to break you guys apart.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Having sex with a guy who was toooooo smallllll!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> what's so shameful sex is freakin' awesome!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I cant stop thinking about him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> OLD man says:hey baby,wanna see me change my teeth.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> that's more exciting u know.shyness sucks.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't spend a lot of money.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I wouldnt dump my girl over those I have gotten nude pics from.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just look at her eyes and smile.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> couldn't have been bad if they married anyway.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> friend, spouse, or even your family members.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> u better leave his a$$ u can do bad all by yoself!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but, to make this person stay with u is a dificult part.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if ur in bangalore i am here :)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he lies to me and hangs up in my face.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I don't think it's a sin, but it surely ends in fornication!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> lol... well, I think that being on that beach next to the fire with spotter888 sounds pretty darn good!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you are going to find someone else and wonder why you forgave this guy so many times!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Depends if you believe in books about what dreams mean I guess...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Takes a lot of patience, I bet.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> What in the HELL should I say??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But, we are happy and enjoy life!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You marry becasue you want to spend the rest of your life with the man!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> HE ALWAYS SAYS SORRY..BUT THEN A MONTH LATER HES LYING AND BEING DISHONEST.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I start quiet and get louder and louder and then....BAAAAMMMM!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I can't help thinking, was it me?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Not all guys care only about sex.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Prob his way of good time is sex.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you like a man talk to him and get to know him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It really depends how ugly she is.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> so just make sure she knows how much you love her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> DO NOT TELL HIM FACE TO FACE, IT MAY HAVE BEEN GOOD AT ONE TIME IT WONT BE NOW.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well then recognize what you dont want to
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> O and trust me IT CAN GET BAD!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> guys r not scared of the word love.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> nope.. maybe he wants 2 hear ur voice b4 he tucks himself 2 bed.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Would u make out with him, even if u werent officially going out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> your wrong on that one personal issues huh?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> When you cant get that person off your mind
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i would ask her if it was urs
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> How could anyone not like kids ???
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> twice first one i met and wanted to marry right then, the second is still unravelling.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I told him how do you know I'm looking at you ????
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and their friends will bad talk you to theirs and so on and so on
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Asking this cuz is like it is always guys that is ready and up for sex..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Never let anyone tell you different
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Jealousy is a heck of a demon to fight.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> - Dress up & act ladylike.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> as soon as they get mad beacause you wont have sex with them, dump them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If that doesn't do it, then I'm stumped.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I don't like the way they cus.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yes ya not and now that person seem to be a good frined
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> FIRST OF ALL THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT AGE MATCH THE DESIRES DIFFER...SO BE CAREFUL
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> The rest is just window dressing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> jus tell her how you feel and why you love her
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well he wont be married much longer.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i mean beauty is skin deep!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> u r not considered unless u do it back in return.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> She was kind of this outcast punk rocker chich with big blue eyes.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Sending money is NOT better, your kid wants YOU there!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Have you ever heard of descriminating based on sexual orientation...and how that is WRONG???
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I actually prefer Hispanic men above all!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If I do then why would I be snooping around In his stuff?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> not love, but who knows right?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but definately force her because no bra is very unattractive.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Probably the flirting led you to beleive he DID want more?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if that doesn't work tell him that you have an STD.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> She is nothing special to others, but she is my true LOVE... That's all !!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> In places where there are black men...duh!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> hell NO,  u must be smart
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if youre talkin about here, the internet, that is a wrong place.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ive actually heard alot of guys say that thye prefer virgins.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> oh not to mention a cute A$$ and small boobies ( ya as weird as it is!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> because they are an orgasm addict
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If the guy doesn't like her, then advice to move on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Obviously you decided you don't want to sleep with him or you would have already.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If so how many years have you been married?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> try yes if u like him and no if u dont!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> trust ur humor, beauty, intelligence, relation with other, how u conenct... and the like.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you are doing the right thing just devorce him, and get back to your life.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Stop thinking about what could be and dreaming.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if he realy loves you than he wouldnt care if you have nothing to offer.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Some places to go to: beaches, restaurants,...etc.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yes tell him the worst he will do is say no
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> hay just be friends with him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> After I busted him cheating of course.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well try kissing him...are there any sparks?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yeah but you get more horny than fall in love
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Games, games games, don't play them, you always loose.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> To each their own BUT I'll still be eating my chocolates and enjoying my roses while you...........?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just remember a man is stll a man.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> So......you wanta have sex or not?!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> 1ST OF ALL YOU CAN'T HELP WHAT YOU DREAM ABOUT, AND 2ND FANTASIZING IS JUST THAT, A FANTASY.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If my sister's friend shit on ME I would leave the room immediately!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But i will expect her to do the same..So just get with better guys....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If he gets the point, then stick it out...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and when she does, all she dreams about is him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> dont compromise your salvation for anyone.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yes, I guess I like the thugish type of guys.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i was 15 that was 9 months ago an im still with her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> do you think she'll know that you like her without telling her?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just don't tell her you love her too early.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> they can never be what you are.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I care about him a lot, and I miss him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> u broke up leave it 2 him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i noticed you like goo goo dolls have you ever seen then in concert.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> maybe she's not a material kind of girl.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> There really is no way to answer that without sounding like a racist of which I am not.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> its basically deciding who i want to marry.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just remember its up to you if u dont want to u dont have to!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Later on that month things started changing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> REally tell her to think twice.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> How about a nice homemade personalised gift!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Then it is up to her to listen or not and find out in the hard way or not
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> there not the kind of guy you want.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Have you ever had a fallout like that?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you dont even know how old he is???
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> as little as possible forgive and forget
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> older as in 3 - 5 yrs so he's alot matured
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> at least you can trust us cause even if we lie you'd know!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> movies are fun, but it doesnt provide much bonding.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> she tried to use the credit cards and learned they did not work.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i can tell u that all girl think different.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Dreams are just that dreams and it is our brain working things out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But be extra careful, you're playing with fire!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Knock that bastard upside his head.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You might not like it but pretend to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> marriage is better, no one said that it was going to be easy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if not someone will find u
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> how old r u well that doesn't even matter run
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I'm just not attracted you anymore.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If I did, yahoo answers would not be where I would look!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you try it once...its menas you tried it once.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If my hubby cheated, I'd probably chop his thing off and hang it from the mustang's rearview mirror...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I get hungry twice a day.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I laughed my ass off when i read it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I luv talking to him, it's like I don't feel real good unless I talk to him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> friends are hard to come by..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> mr nobody get drunk and kiss her that is how i did it three year ago.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If the boy has such an attitude of mind he's not worth ur love even if u r simple.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> so thats why i went with matt.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> My yahoo chat name used to be 'iscreamifyoudoitright'
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just ask her she'll probably like you to have some help
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> SHE OR HE WILL GET IT.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> My wife gave me a kiss and took off with the kids.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> undress yourself infront of him u will know
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> then, i learned that he likes me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I am cause if i wasnt then i'd be w. a girl lol!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if he has friends though then maybe he likes you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Why in the world WOULDN'T a guy date a virgin?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Who here has married their high school sweetheart?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Did u watch movie The Game?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> leave him alone he got what he wanted and maybe don't want to talk to you anymore
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> LEAVE HIM ALONE OR YOU MIGHT BE RUNNING INTO TROUBLE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I have gotten dates, not as many as if I played stupid.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i bet you'll fall for me once you see me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But you're probably too good for her anyway.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And if not the pet store... just look around the barns.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> u dont just lose the bi**h cuz she will stay to hurt u and love doing it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it's very easy....just tell him... talk to me or get out of my life thats all honeybun
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just say  I love me too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> its not so good for the person who has the available booty.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Well obviously if she won't tell you she doesn't want you to know.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i asked him if he still liked me & he said no.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and look at pictures of guys.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> do whats right and listen to your heart!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Why don't you have a job?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just be a cool guy, don`t take girls for granted.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you're a fucking retard and if you were my kid you wouldn't be allowed to date.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> She is using you to get over here!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> u need to talk to him about it and tell him to stop
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i need to know if its alright
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> have sex right before you go to bed
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if he speaks about it then listen to him and show that u care.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't even do that to yourself!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> same reason why men do it!~ ^_^
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> dude you forget about that you move on you find someone who loves you

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you are a boy then sure!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I am scared to ask him if he stills likes me, because I liked him too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Ask her permission if in doubt!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> in no way do you need him or anyone bring you down.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I couldn't hurt someone I cared about that way.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Have u cheated on her in the past?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i cant stand a woman like that.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> dunno, cook him dinner, show him u care.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> we think we are giving them signals but they dont get it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ALTHOUGH I'M SURE IF THEY COULD WE ALL KNOW WHAT THE DECISSION WOULD BE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> maybe you should not be worried at all.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> kiss her on the cheek first and if she knows what u mean shell carry on from there.. ;)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> my husband and i moved in after 2 weeks go 4 it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Ain't the size kiddo, it's how u use it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i think everybody has a right to enjoy my girlfriend doin stripping..  U r welcome to the party too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> 1.when you hear that love song and all you think about is them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but do you love somebody ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but even if, she's still ur friend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i know alot just email me and i will tell you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> dont try to impress her at all.Just let her know that you like her
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Do u have Irish in you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> maybe that is why it is called fantazys
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Some learn it and do well, others do not.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but they dont have to be half naked.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> So if you find the answer let me know.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I wanna do things to you I wouldn't even do to an oreo.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I am really mature so don't mess with me!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't just go to him and say hey I wanna bone your sister really bad.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Until then, quit being such a jerk.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you really like him you will just know.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> not a bad person at ALL!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I doesnt matter if u do it right!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> be nice and relaxed and let her know that you like her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> People don't do things they don't get something out of.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I BELIEVE A WOMAN SHOULD MAKE HER OWN DECISSION.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You should call him and ask him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I am a 20 yo female.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> people have lots of reasons why  they have not found that right person.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You can still be friends...hell even friends with benefits.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And you really want him to ask you to marry him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> look forget the fu?k and go out with me!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And just do it, if yo wait you will never get anywhere.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> look you just have to be normal.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Every once in a while, I won't, just for a change.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> start looking for someone  more compatable and closer your age
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Have I told... you lately... that I lub you...?

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Next, you should totally focus on getting to Level 3, real fast, okay ?!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> SHE SHOULD DECIDE TO PREVENT GETTING PREGNANT.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no, coming from a girl, i dont think about sex as much as my ex boyfriend did.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I don't like a big cry baby though!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Why would you want to marry someone that is in jail for one..????
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> we have flurted may times but i just don't know *_*
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it is not men ,it is the boy you went out with.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but i took an instant dislike for him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Then of course there are many questions on wheather i've been f---ked up the a--.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just speak with your eyes baby!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Women want it slow......and take too long for it......men want it without a tease.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and we sat on my bed and looked in her eyes and huged her and kissed/made out with her
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Why get married.... just become some ones Biotch
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> u've gotta accept the sad truth.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> don't you love your xgf at all?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> so it's either get over him, or wait.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> beside now this days its hard to find a virgin!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> REPEAT AFTER ME....YOU ARE A LYING DIRT FACE!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> -im just wondering-      -thanks for answering-
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Go hang around with some really rough men, you know, a ' man's man'
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i care for him a lot, but only as a friend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I'm a self-proclaimed nympho, but I dunno if I'm just really nasty or really horny... all the time.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> She might come clean to u if she doesn't want to be with u anymore.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Honey, if you don't want to have sex with a guy, that's o.k.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> First, Who broke up with who?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Dress like a decent lady and you will find nicer guys.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I'll try anything once and again if I like it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> as long as there is no physical activity, I don't see why not
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i don't know are u ready for one?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> jon told me to stay with matt.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he will b pleasently suprised and will luv all the more for it:)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> & i told him yes very.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> cheat on her with one of her friends and treat her friend better than u treated her
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you're not planning to marry him, why bother?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> the problem is that the girls that do smell.. think they don't.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Most guys care about that, some don’t, it’s up to the guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> tell him to go to hell!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Get yourself some self esteem and dump his ass.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> its probably that woman don't like wussies!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But yeah, guys do think about sex more than girls.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> mayb its cuz ur doin something wrong!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> older doesnt mean that his foot is in d grave.. lol.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> are there reasons you do not trust him?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Hand the mofo a toilet brush.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> hit me up if u want more... digital_lyricist at yahoo dot com.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you want to get married then do so.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> astrology is a bunch of bunk.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Men are beautiful no matter what.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Ask him straight up, if he wants to marry you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> BUT TO MUCH OF A GOOD THING CAN TURN IN TO A BOTHER.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> cuz they have a one track mind
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> He doesn't like your kids, you don't like his?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Have your fun now when you are single.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> because its called lust, which is a sin.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I guess I just have some anxiety about it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but my new girl really means a lot to me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> make sure it's a good, clean fun.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Now you get two of everything.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> theres a mr right for every girl.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Go to movies, sight seeings etc.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well now, that kind of difficult.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> What you need to do is get MAD!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> maybe she wants to have sex but not with u.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> where do u get these stats?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you connect with someone, just don't worry about other people's feeling's...   Dr Checko...   (Nickname)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I love having phone sex w/my bf.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just tell him to his face in a nice way, that its over.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Its easy Find someone to marry you in the Jail
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> What if some guy would ask, why are all woman s1uts?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> she might do it agin oh and thanks i'll let him know.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't let anybody ever tell you different.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Oh, and if the guy is to marry the girl, she can't have slept with too many other guys.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I am an old fashioned kind of guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you are with an unsaved (sinner) you are a sinner too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no phisical contact, no eyes contact, no hand contact, just the faith that the other one says the truth...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> maybe she also got the same feeling as u are..............
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> good looks,good habbits & ofcourse a great figure makes a girl a good girlfrind
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Why not get a job and send him money?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Give her something really nice and then ask right there on the spot.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> then she will think you are really hiding something.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Stop thinking about looks and start looking at people on how they treat u
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> can any1 here speak clear english?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It's about the one you're with.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Who could say no to that?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Repeat after me IT'S NOT MY FAULT!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I got 2: u judge for yrself.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> She asked me about my feelings...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> my old man don't he just go right to it and get in it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> then one day he started flirting with me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> only if u feel like u need a boyfriend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no because the same thing happened to me  but it might be different
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Would it bother him if you did were asking guys for pictures?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> u r jus experiencing new things which is a gud thing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If not it wasn't meant to be.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and if he likes you for your activities, start doing things that he wouldn't like.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> start talking about marriage ands kids and his family that might spook him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> flowers,  not roses that might be too strong.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> YOu don't have to run but you might want to tell him to slow down!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> when me & matt first got together i really liked jon, & i didnt know he liked me too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> hmm, I would hide their lunch box and not play with them at recess!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> NO, I THINK YOU CANT SPELL.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you most likely can do alot better.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> That would be NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and it makes ppl more anxious and jealous, so beware of that too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I'VE HAD THIS PROBLEM SO MANY TIMES JUST STICK WITH BOTH OF THEM BUT JUST PLAY YOUR CARDS RIGTHT!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> IT MAY TO LATE TO ATTEMPT ABORT.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> So I will tell you what alot of the guys I know dream of.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if he treated her right then i see nothing wrong with it its not like she is your sis
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Boys love themselves its sick man.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if she likes you then she should know that your new at it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it depends on u. but would u want to?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but it jus bothers me cus i want 2 w/ him but i wanna wait!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you like another guy though you should probably just say that!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Is it that you don't have one, or your ehaving trouble with the one you have?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And hes not a druggie or nothing like that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just be friendly not fwd i.e.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and he probuble did not awnser your calls cause he was truely bussy
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ask them wen theyre hooked up 2 a lie detectotr
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I like him but..im not in love with him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> go to the gym - workout practice speaking with a lower your voice be confident
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i would just be straight up with your friend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You can do better, doll !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> tell him your baby is in need of him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I feel old too and I'm 20.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't blow it on a thing called sex.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> y cant they just treat us with respect?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if he is still talking to her, he is probably cheating on you or very close to it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but once she leaves him karma goes around so it will go back to him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i would say in most cases yes
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Plus, women aren't just ready You need to help...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> don't ask let him say it on his own
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But if I had to choose...Black... White men just don't do it for me..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> No, if you already free him in you're life and find another girl.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well now im pregnant with his kid... how do i tell him without him going BALISTIC!!!???!!!???!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> dont drag it out, but make it short and to the point.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Would u like to be called stupid?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I dunno cuz me and my fiance are like that to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> my guy does he says that it gives him an oppunity to tell be how beautiful i am
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I also like kids...but I'm not one.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It's not just a guy thing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Well, like I wouldn't necessarily just drop my friend like just because we fight.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Do you see yourself happy for the rest of your life with this person?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> think why you guys broke up and then you move on too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Go where ur P leads u mayb even in the wrong direction!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I need advice from other ppl.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Dump the one you have (Trust me: She'd be shocked!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Then a personality that isn't too bad.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i dont think that girls are bad liars.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well it creeps ME out but some people get intense pleasure from it...go figure
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> its only normal to cool off i guess.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You need to ask YOURSELF if you like him!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Doesn't sound like a good mate to me.. but that's just me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you like guys and girls, then you are bi.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he should have the heart not play w/ sum1s heart.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> First, choose only one guy, you love.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But men are people to and have feelings just like us ladies do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I can't think of ANY reasons.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I wouldn't want my guy having lunch with some other lady on V-day!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> many reasons for marriage break ups, money, kids, infidelity, stress, family
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> also for older kid, try putt putt golf, laser tag, go-karts, that kind of thing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i loved my boyfren of 8 years.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i really mature for my age too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> when you find your gem hopefully he'll want you for you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> She is the boss, and you had an intimate interlude with her -that is that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> the problem is, how can i say no and still remain good friends?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you will always wonder if you never tell him the truth
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> make it slow and steady... opss i'm a man...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> straight up tell them and at the right moment.not whn there is a bunch of ppl around
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> good things come to those who wait.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> show her she's important and not your stupid friends
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> hmmm well 1st NO its not always bout the outside of a woman!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but hes as clueless as i am.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I have been nothing but nice to her everyday....what should i do?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> WHAT KIND OF FATHER DOES THAT MAKE HIM???
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if she breaks ur heart its not my fault, you shouldn't have listened 2 my advice.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I loved this guy but after he humiliated me in front of 40 ppl, I dunno wat I feel!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Maybe the both of you need time apart.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> an easy way of saying he just wants to be a booty call.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> or just excited about being in love?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If he wants to be friends thenso be it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Have u ever wondered why they have to fight?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Because that is all they ever thing about...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> We're not mind readers you know...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Sometimes guys say that stuff to play you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> umm..prolly because you're single and couldn't get a date??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you get tied up in mess your going to come out with mess.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Oh forgot a big one for you ladies.....ever use the sample cosmetics at the mall?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Or, one day, slap him with a kiss!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and depends on if he likes war games or sports or role playing ect...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> all guys do it even when they're married
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I love to dream, about different men, I guess it's okay.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But you'll never catch a woman admitting to it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you asking this it means that you love your wife.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well... if he doesn't even know who you are it looks really hard... but it is worth trying
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> BRUSH YOUR MOUTH TWICE..THERE WILL BE NO TROUBLE..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> because some guys tottally lose their brain when they are around hot grl like me :)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if not no if your to young like 12 and younger then no.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> what to do is simple know her/his emotions and talk about such emotion things
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ya the moneys is great but there alot of stuff in those places .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it just depends on how it is.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you won't meet anyone too serious unless you got a big dick.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it that true i tryed taking to him but he wont return my calls.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and tell them how sad you are.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> come to romania with me, i already live there:)!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You wake up and one day just know.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> they're happy, so it could work for you too!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> believe me, you DO NOT mess with a friend's younger sister.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if all you want is to be with him, stay with him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> lets talk on yahoo shrunkenmann_thegrass  (100% girls only)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> she really looks up to u and thinks of you as a friend and probly nothing more
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I wouldn't worry about the embarrasment factor there.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Oh yes, if you realy feel the need to..send him one too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> youhave some work to do there.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> have a serious talk with and tell her that it is childish and you are getting older.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> comunication but are you sure u wanna do that
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Now if you can't say this to his face scream it in the mirror with him not around...Know why?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> as for what to do... dont DO anything.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no only if they are sick
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and if not, you will show him how.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ).....I am looking for virgin girl as I havent sex yet.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yeah your mom is going out with him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he will love you so much more ...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but if you think that this could lead you to a heartbreak then wait and watch what happens!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he must have been a friend at one time.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> The phrase to use is, Hey, I got enuff friends
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> first of all she,s not much of a best friend, keep your eye on her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Try yahoo personals to see if you like some guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> then tell him that if he's interested, u could go out sometime.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Stare at that for a bit.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> maybe my mother, but that's another story!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you might be too hot for your own good.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> go on a cruise and push her overboard.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Dont push her or tell her you love her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but thats not a bad thing if you enjoy it and its with a responsible person.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> beause they dont think with the head on their sholders.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Believe in yourself...it is very SEXY!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I have dated several bi females and its a turn on BIGTIME!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if i really think about it i want to be with both of them i guess.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no, it just like he loves exchanging girlfriends every now and then.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> both  if i have to choose only one then beauty for this moment
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I say.... that whatever your instinct tells you is happening....is happening.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> so i guess a little of both
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> MAKE LOVE WITH A LOVED ONE .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yeah like lumbeeman said, have your bff tell him for you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yes he is a MAN that is what we do!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> BUT EVERYTIME I GET BACK ITS THE SAME CRAP OVER AGAIN.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just try to let him know you!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You don't know what real problems are until you get married and have kids!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> that is a lie  if you really  love the person  your relationship  will stay strong  no matter what
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> So we always meet and I feel like him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> maybe he's just checkin' if you're alright.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> with love will be full of sweet meanings
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> sure, feel free to chat me up anytime.....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> your still going to feel you can not trust men.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You can't really expect to give him anything too pricey!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Believe wat u want 2 blive.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well, I WOULD date a girl who was stripper, because I don't matter who she was.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> sense of humor is very important
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he says he respects tht i wanna wait and undetrsatnds!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i thought this boy liked me he used to stare at me all day long.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but if ur ok w/ it, and it should b ok!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just assure her that mom/dad both love her very much even tho mom/dad don't live together anymore.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> u will prove to be a great sis!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i guess people want what they can't have.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you can like who ever u like
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You should definately tell her to wait.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> tell ur partnner and undetstand him well, help ur self to help each other.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Hubby & i got married in July (7-7-01) and went to Hawaii for 2 weeks!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> because if you're not, it will be dry sex and will hurt.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> wat do i do with both of them?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Unless you absolutley love it I would say NO!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> There are men who don't care at all about what they look like.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> where do u want it to go?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Maybe its because he is not lonely.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If u have an he still continues to do it then let him go u dont need that!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> how much success you get in your life and you find love is the reason for that success
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> TRY BEING THE WOMEN THEN I AM SURE ULL FIND ONE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> does anybody know what love is any more.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You urinate from there, and don't even wipe!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Any guy that's not completely desperate won't ask you out again if you dumped him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> we try to make females comfortable.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Or  If I see you with another girl, I'll rip her bloody arms off.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You need to get a job if you asking questions like that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And ask yourself if he is a decent person and is nice.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I have a friend who had the hood of her clitoris pierced very very cool
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> So how do i approch a woman and ask her to come home with me and my  b/f?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> THEN YOU KNO WAT TO DO......forgive.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no everything everyone else said is true also.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i dont care if your a virgin  if you are slutty that matters i dont want VD
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> tell her while in a middle of a conversation to surprise her
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if he does that means he really cares for you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> as long as u r true.true love u will find anywhere.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> see if she emails you back or find out in person.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Easier to move on,two wrongs don't make a right.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Tell them that they will never get anywhere in life by being a liar!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Dogs r like family(trust me i know.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> only if your heart desires to, if your gut says run then do so
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And of course stop & say hey!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If they are hurting themselves too much to listen tho..find another adult....  a grandparent?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i know a women who was married to a jerk and he beat their kids.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> cos dey have a guilty conscience
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and after the police left the dog was in custidy and the kids were back in bed.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> stop doing this then if she is not willing
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i sure would like to talk to someone
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yes, like you are a complete stranger to me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I don't think MOST guys are stupid.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Well, if you are a girl and you like a lesbian, then you ARE a lesbian!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Even if what he is saying is true- why would he text message other girls asking for naked pictures?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i love my ex with all my heart.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> DONT TELL HIM FIRST, GO TO YOUR MOM OR SCHOOL SOCIAL WORKER AND LET THEM TALK TO YOUR PARENTS.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It's not as Difficult if you know what your doing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if it's love, then he will wait and also not cheat on you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Make them laugh and they'll love u.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Men like this are a waste of scum!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Unless if you like being treated like poop.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i would not like to be the 7th guy if she thinks about the 8th
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> im getting 21 this coming august 10 2006. thats true
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> this is the love most people seek, yet are to lazy to earn it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> maybe because they knew you would be furiouse.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just talk to her and see if she does like you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> LMAO, great way to start the day, LOL
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I gave him a second chance but he didnt take.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if she wants to, she will when shes free.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Lights on and on top is sexy!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> be friend and give him some timen space
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ...you're starting to hate the male/female friends of the one you love.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Do something that most people haven't.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i dont believe that love dies so fast.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ok, i think its just nothing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> she's still probably living w/ her parents
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> This is a major NO, NO!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ANY WAY SHE IS STILL WITH YOU SO OBVERSLY SHE DOES .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I wouldn't worry about things like that!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Sounds like he's playing hard to get...and you aren't.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I'm not sure even chickens care about it thats what
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You get out what you put in (no pun intended)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> SOAP If you smell better maybe.....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just move on ... think about how lucky you are to not be with him!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> What can I do to get her to lose weight?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> leave him, he is not worth your time
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> a lot of attention and to be fed some good chocolate.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if he gets too possesive send him packing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> when you can hear echother without speaking
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You should try it some time you will not be dissapointed
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i mean.how insensitive of her to do those things infront of you!!duh?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> other than that, go to a party and hit on drunk chicks.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and just ask him, it might be awkward but it will be worth it if he does love you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> SAY I LOVE YOU IF ITS MEANT TO BE IT WILL JUST COME OUT
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it will pay off in the long run.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I am always into the A-Hole guys, Whats my problem?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Would I pack my husband's bags?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> then you don't have a relationship.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> why my ex b/f keeps tryin to make me jealous..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> my best friend is a guy and we have never tried to be more
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> In my case though, it didn't!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> hang around with her,go shopping if she likes it,.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> nope he has a lady sorry,
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you love a boy then tell hem
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> my dad is like that too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> He needs to grow up and mature
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I'm not asking him to go out or anything even close to that!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> So, #1 - boys say things they don't really mean.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just find other girl, she dont love you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> marrying the lady of my dreams would mean that i have everything i dreamed of.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and really get to know her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I'M MARRIED WITH ONE CHILD AND I WANT TO BE SINGLE AGAIN.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> find a new man if you care that much
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You deserve someone that will NOT LISTEN TO OTHER PEOPLE WITHOUT ASKING YOU FIRST !!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> (at least of course if you are over 18!)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> He was like hey baby whats happnin'.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And you already had sex with this man.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well you can apologize,, but you can't have him back,, just accept what you already decided...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> try watching an adult movie together.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> After you ask the gal, y u dont like me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but she has a boyfriend so dont make a move.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But YES it could work if you want it to!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It's too late, you missed your chance, and she has moved on now.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you know your in love if u have sex with them
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Because after all i'm in your school.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ;)  Come on ladies- tell him!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just be patient dont' rush your self.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i heard once it was not.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and stay away from the plants i mentioned.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> People are just plain dumb .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it could never be  boring thing
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I'VE BEEN WITH MY HUSBAND SINCE I WAS 19 AND I'M GOING TO BE 26 NEXT MONTH.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Never buy a women lingere unless it is something she wants.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> dude same here.. but i don't think its a bad choice...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I asked her to dance and we are now friends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> either that or u try to find his other self and accept him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If ha can't respect you then he's got to go!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Very truly speaking, wether my friends agree or not, they cannot ever find a friend like me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Instead of telling him -show him what you like...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you do not find her it will just happen.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You do understand they're just using you, don't you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And since you aren't even sure, then you know it isn't worth it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I'd marry your cat just to get in the family!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> before too long..>>>>> YOU SUCKED THEM INTO YOUR BLACKHOLE OF LOVIN!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I'm right here baby, all you gotta do is ask
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> get buck wild have sex anywhere and everywhere.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> good luck buddy you will need it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it is not right, and is it legal?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> My sister has dumbed him since then but she is pregnant with his baby.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yeah baby.. a girl knows what a irl wants right???
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> He even slept with his best friends wife.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> or do you enjoy hurting those that mean so much to you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it's pretty much up to you to decide you don't want to be miserable anymore.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I wouldnt want or need anyone else.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> something that happened behind your back.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> become a friend to a women first.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he probably won't tell you, but he's most likely to tell sum1 else.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> because when you are into a relationship, and if you go out for fun... this kills your partner.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> He is a piece of shit and i never want to see him agen.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> She might be able to fake moaning, shaking, thrashing around, etc., but she can't fake that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> maybe you have but u dnt knw it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just don't go overboard with all your planning!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> we get along great except this issue.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> time to move on to  a differnet place ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well ask him or ask ur friends that know him and they might know.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Tell him that you are a beautiful vampire ;))
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> the coaches were more laid back and i usually played over half the game.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> THAY LEFT US KNOW CHOICE BUT TO PART.i NEVER STOP LOVING HIM.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Start by saying I want to kiss you here (nose) then here (mouth) and here (cheek) Then here (neck)!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Girl, don't TELL him you want to make love to him!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i dont know... are you in love?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> wait, it will be well worth it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i dont think u should give him any more times u dont wanna get hurt again
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> He'll find that with another, but YOU want something more, don't you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> make them want to break up with you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if he loves you, he will be heartbroken, but he will get over it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> U shouldn't be with no man who gonna keep pushin u to do things u don't want to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Some guys that have experience don't know which way is up.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> hook up with math geeks, they know how to handle curves :-)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you have to basically overdose to get off.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you have tried to hard!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> What was that about now I am curious too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> A UPCLASS STRIP BAR WITH LOSTS OF BEER
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yes i would, in a heart beat!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> here is not the place to find one
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Yes dude, if you start lifting your a** off that chair!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But that also depends on WHO YOU are??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yes, at least mine do live.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Cauze if you never give it a chance u will never know what would had happen between yall 2.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I have never heard of a guy who didn't like this.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> obviously if he's going through all that trouble to scare you he doesn't want you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> things like this are bad to do thru email
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well, why did you post such a stereotypical, dumb and pointless question?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i just wanna help her open up her eyes before something bad happens....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Thats not very fair to the guy your seeing now.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> they want a man just to be himself, at least I do
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> is it just too weird and geeky!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> wow.... what a situation..... good luck with that!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> is not bad, if you like him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he could be just using you for just sex.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I'm sorry if you love him (wait you said that you didn't) Anywho, leave him please!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you have ever right to be mad
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But send the ole boy a post card from Bora Bora or something.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Maybe you should tell her and see what response you get.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Why would you care, as long as you got yours...right?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i 100% agree with u there.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> A hard face 2 go wit it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Ive asked her to be my girl friend 2 times already but she never answers.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> got anything better to do the rest of your life than trying to understand them?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ya I care, but its not everything
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> hey, i am 12 and just got a girl friend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just ask him or tell him u luv him n ask him 2 b ur boyfren
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> No, this is not bad at all.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> because u already know so much about oneanother.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I never talk bad about any person.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> okay youre confusing 1 question at a time.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> cheat on her with a hooker they have experience
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> not  only men have them, women can too
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> #3 - don't use sex as a weapon in your marraige
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> That way you get to sample other women and it's not cheating.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> what happend to his queen kong?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> mabey but ill never find him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Do not do it in private.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Who cares wha their gender is.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Shower, wear deodorant & always have fresh breath...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> No matter if your in a skirt and heals or a baggy pair of jeans.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> dude, go back to lickin yer nuts.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> HE USED TO MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY ABUSE ME.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I have gone out with big guys.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Do you have a chicken butt?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you like her ask her out and see where it takes you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> tell your man, to tell him that u don't like that guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> No guy wants to be just friends with women.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> or what do you think about marriage?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Yet I will not date a large man.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but try to stay out of this till time makes them calm;) Good Luck
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Sex and candy Where can I find you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> its better to loose a lover than love a looser
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Well if a guy does that to me, I just move on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> alright, the way it's always worked for me is to go out with a friend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> First off, don't do anything you don't want to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> As Gab said...no way to know.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> your a 40 year old woman you should look for someone your around age
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't push the ladies... they don't respond well.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> why dont you call her.send some valentines card!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You mite lose the one you love,to some- one else.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> my bffl went ut w/ a really short guy and they even kissed.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I'm 38 :-)  would anybody lie about that age ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> What exactly do guys want from girls?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Lastnight when me and my ex talked I asked him that question!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if he is a nice guy, he'll understand and probablly stop if he likes you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Ank one other thing, trust her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just surprise him...... You can do it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just wait... maybe its yet the time for you to meet the right one
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no it s not noemal it is abnormal
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> im comfused wot was u askin?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If he did, he wouldn't have even looked at the other girl.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If I could arrange the alphabet I would put U next to I.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> personally can't even think of going out with someone i gave the boot to bf.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> why do married /committed men cheat?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> afterall she has lived her life all these days jus 4 u...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> where the heck do you live?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It seem's from your statement, your just hangin on to a dream... Dr Checko... (Nickname)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> who can put me back together
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> u should ask a person u trust or a doctor.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> any person hu loves u shud think think about your feelings.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Where does the baby's daddy fit in?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you shouldnt get with your cousin.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> my love... aka my girlfriend aka my everything aka shes perfect...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Guys can have female friends too -
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you might even find that you dont like being sexual with a woman at all.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> however I think stupid far excedes dumb.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Because once they are interested then the CHASE is over
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and why would you go with somebody that young or old
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> wellllll some guy's butts are cute.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If he is trying to control you - GET OUT!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you truly like this person, then why not give it a try?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no, drop dead girl who dumped me....I even won't give a damn to her anymore....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no dought about it im positive!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i think 'no answer' is your answer, you just don't want to admit it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> sweetie, love conquers all...what are you so worried about?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Never can be if ur a teen or kid or something........

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I love my bf/childs father to death!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Bear in mind, that this guy hadn't been in a relationship for almost 9 years!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Read this article and say whatever you can to stop her!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Rather say, Whos on yer mind...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> many men are totally happy just keep sex interesting and exciting and he will never even consider it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just them down and explain to them they should be understanding , and support u no matter what .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I'm just his friend, I mean, I LOVE him and as far as i know, he has no idea.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And you have a problem with this?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> step 2: if you don't see any result after 3 weeks.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i have id in yahoo with camera.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> The guy is married for god's sake!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And its usually the one who is not as good in bed as the other.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it is never boring it's actually fulfilling
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> lights off w/ very few candles and on top of the covers
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> oh yes you can.....Where were you that day in sex ed?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> so here, take it, but don't take it for granted.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if they dont then they arent worth you caring what they think
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But why would he ignore me??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I think a guy with a nice round butt is sexy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I have guy friends that are like brothers to me and there's no tension whatsoever.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i here a coat hanger and a vacuum will do the job
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> u should have a nice impression on the girl .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> gather all ur girlfrends & have a party.. let her mingle w/new faces..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ur spellings tell how worried u r.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> sounds like you are hot, so thats a good start!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> nobody can do it better than you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you are such green minded people!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just remember alot of married men are very happy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But don't be like are you a virgin.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ya know I have the same problem, so I know what ya mean.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> GIRLS SORRY THIS LOOSER SAID THAT ABOUT YOU THE REST OF US THINK YOUR ALL GREAT
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Never mind what anyone else wants!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> so what do u want to do now?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You really need to learn to read a person, you know?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> guy: im a caveman girl:whats this?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yes get rid of the cat.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just get it over with and text him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> or just my guy ego cant handle a girl knowin about it !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you have money to spend, girls usually love jewelry!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If she like the beach maybe a weekend in the Bahamas.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> this my opinion,that's whow i think about this!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you don't like any of the guys that asked you out then just say no.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it can be very sexy to watch a woman... and yo might get a pointer or two...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> do it in person though, set up a dinner date.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> u dont take any precaution and u get pragnent
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> HE'S IGNORING U FOR THE SAME REASONS WE IGNORE YOU!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> !LOL WHEN I WENT OUT THERE I NOTICED THAT TOO.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> im 28 years old.im almost handsome.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Tell her to try asking him out or something.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ur question is making ppl able to know that u r single.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Bro's before ho's...Ok, so your girls, the saying still works.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i would not give my life up for a stranger or a friend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> People dont care anymore about others.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And u tell him it's ur way or no way.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> call and say hello and be done with it one way or another
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> put your nose into her p...!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> She's just not that into you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> like me my luv lives far away from me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> WHAT IN GODS NAME ARE YOU DOING.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't let her play games with you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It cant be love because you dont know anything about her!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it is better and easier to tell over the phone or in person.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you won't find love on the internet
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> u cant put ur life to be all about her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> its simple that u should take her out for dating .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> jus t tell them u already have a date sorry about that you should have asked earlier
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> easy 2pts for me and -2pts for u
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Once I just said, Well, if there's nothing better to do .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> she might have an underlieing factor that makes her eat this much ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> step 3: if she is pregnant then end of procedure.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you sneeky bugger..i was just going to ask this question.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Probably the one thing that comes before good health on the human scale of existance!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> WOMEN LIKES TO BE PAMPERED,TAKE HER TO DINNER OR ORDER IN CANDLES, FLOWERS,JUST TREAT HER LIKE A QUEEN.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i think so for romantic love plus its really fun
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> so wht to ddo YOU think!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Not special, not weird...  just your personal choice.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> can u check it out for me plz die fast
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> the question is the other way around how do get your guy to back off the girl.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I went to one where they had a belly dancer instead...LAME!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> she already knows it not love.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I wouldn't worry about the heroin.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I like to laugh and tell jokes!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> IT CANT BE DONE,IF THEY CARE ABOUT YOU ITS GOING TO HURT NO MATTER HOW YOU SAY IT.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Wat are you good at doing?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> someone else might take the opportunity.........DON'T BE LATE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If they r not, why would be so mean?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> start cutting him off now -- that way when you get married, he'll be used to it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just say 'I love you' getting him/her off guard.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he obviouly doesnt accept u for u so how can u stay with him no piont in being miserable.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i believe that they will.why not?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Because once you cross the friendship line it's really hard to go back to that!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i think that boys are more sensitive but girls show it more.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> gave: Get a life... and relax.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> so just go ahead and text!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> dont stick with someone who isnt right for you, its just not worth it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> dont belive in it at all....its too commercialized!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he is only using you ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> One might b good n bed, the other a listener!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you got that right .but have to do it any way .or she kill me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> IT WHAT U MAKE OF IT.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> why is he sleeping out with the dog?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Do you dream about her at night?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> so, i guess you just have to circulate the places,activities you enjoy, strike up conversation,and see what happens...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> No, I don't want to shake your hand either
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> IF YOU TRULY IN LOVE YOU DONT WANT ANYTHING ELSE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> SWEET HEART I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Pick yourself up, don't let it bother you too much, and just have fun/play the field.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i think she likes me because of the flirting, and person talk that goes on, between us.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> relax, do it and think that's not the best point in your life.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It wouldn't matter how she looks.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Being 8 years old is pure HELL isn't it??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he will ask you to marry him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> then go ask her out,, :)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Hmmm, a little vague on the informastion giving.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> of course i have plenty of friends who are guys......yet i have plenty of friends that are girls.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> (and i hope things turn out right..)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Seriously, laize faire answer tone from now on...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> As they get  married they syart acting stupid and abusive.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> chances are only once in a blue moon!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> whats the worst thing they can say?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And my guess is that he wants you to have phonsex with him... but maybe you don't?!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> are u implying there is something not good about me???!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> did you just read what you wrote.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And trust me priorities is a big quality to look for!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> they dont see them, they feel them
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Especially if u are looking to get married and settle down.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> took my neighbor (who doesn't drive) to the doctors at 7pm last night after work .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> please her in the bed room also.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just tell her that you need a hug every once in a while.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If a guy didn't really care, he wouldn't give a damn.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> (no offense to big butts, but it was a MAN).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Trust me you can't change them!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it depends u have to ask him first
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> No way to know her virginty, Untill you not fucked her  So don't wait do it fast.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Satisfy UR self but be careful USE PROTECTION!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Some men just need a little extra stimulation to ... ahem, get the job done.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I tell my guy that I love him every day.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> what is a gurl to do?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> because all men love to compete.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You marry the one you can't live without.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> wanna have girl frnds or boy frnds?????
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and dear as i believe sex is to b done to give satisfaction not to get.. unselfishly.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> adam and eve.... they were smart tho
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> For some guys does it not always matter just about the sex?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> my guess is you dont look the same to her either if you dont inspire her to inpress you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you never know, try flirting with girls...that helps
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> YES, I REALLY THINK THERE'S HOPE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> new boyfriend, your a girl it should be easy
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> maybe u just need Mr.Just for Me
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> the way she reponds will tell you if she right for you or not.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you cant to the time [haveing a baby] then dont do the crime [haveing sex]
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Well, I'd believe what the girl said to you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if ur hot also comment on her hair,outfit,or her shoes.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> once u've talked to her then decide where u are going to live.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Being  a lesbian/gay is not cool.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> sex plus friend does not always equal love to both men and women.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> At least he wants you involved in it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> do they feel like he doesn't have confidence or something
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> gosh...i love my sister to death, but she always seems to put herself in unhealthy relationships.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you dont know... that's why they call it love (confusin aint it)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he even accepted my newborne daughter as his own.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If u wana attract ur husband's attention and #@$#)*)#)_*, then u gotta remember TWO WORDS; FOOD AND SEX.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you watched spider-man the upsidedown kiss catch him off gaurd and just lay it on him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> as thick as you want it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And don't think you won't be getting pleasure from it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it should be elaborate, public, and show her really how much she means to you....  GO FOR IT!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you are attracted to men still then you may be bi.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you have been hanging around with the wrong women.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> NEVER HIDE........... u might just loose them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you feel shy, just tell him to close his eyes.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> who needs gud looks if he acts like a beast???
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i'd go wit jamookae ,hz gt serious emotional issues!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And you might have already scared her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Let me guess: move to New Zealand?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> tell him ur boss or just dump him and get anouther man in ur life
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> personality above all...   then fit body (and not neccessarily thin) and kindness...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> We're all a little screwy round here!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Your mom kicked the wrong person out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> So if you havent slept together yet...don't.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> to start having boyfrends 13 but datng like going on dates 16.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> BY THE WAY HE LOOKS AT YOU AND ACT TOWARDS YOU.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> my dad lost about 20 pounds just by playing out side.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> IF these don't WORK OUT, LEAVE things as they were, and START ANEW in a DIFFERENT DIRECTION!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no...why can't a guy talk to another girl without his girlfriend thinking he is cheating?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it means exactly what she says.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Now im at 28 and single.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> far enough to be away from family but close enough so they can visit maybe once a month?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Say hi, then just have casual conversation with him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> they need to compete to be the biggest loser on earth
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> who knows what a woman is doing when she's not with you, trust her or leave her
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i advise u dont hold anything bak.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i am trying to think what is on my mind, that's what :)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I don't really even like the word stupid .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yea my ex said the same thing once.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> a dance is just a dance.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You have a bf that loves you and you love him too right?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you are not married and have sex, its bloooody and hurrrty.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> go to a very important (in her life) vacation resort
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Of course, if it feels right.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You seem like a sweet person...you can find better!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> abbout 3 to 4 hunred is my gguess
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I am to busy to respond to that.. #2 would be....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Some men just don't function the same.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Of course she yelled about it then.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I'm telling you, it was LONG.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Tell your lover how special they are to you & why.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i made it and so can you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if they dodge the question and/or get angry then i would be worried.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> lol I supposed you've tried talking to him?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> a lot of girls like it when you make eye contact.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yes find your next boyfreind .dam there are alot of lonly peoples out there move on
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i kind of have a mix between the two.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> its coo when ur in like 6th grade???
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> remember the good times and forget the bad but it takes time
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well i think you should introduce your self.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Kudos to her for sticking withit even when it upsets her!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it once happened to me man.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Because you're the only ten I see!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> HOW CAN I TELL IF THE MAN IM WITH TRUELY LOVES ME
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> its not bad, but it does look kind of funny if the girl is significantly taller
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> NO THEY CANT BECAUSE SOMEWHERE DEEP DOWN THERE IS A ATTRACTION,,,,,,,,
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Why in the world would you do something like that and then go around telling it???
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If someone doen't ask you out, does that mean that you are unattractive or something????
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You know what, love finds you so don't rush things out ok?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> My problem is I make girls angry because I'm smarter than them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and u kno wat  he doin but u don't care cuz u let him tell ya different.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i think it depends on hwo mature the child is.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I say think long and hard about it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> oh, also tell your man why u hated him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i understand that u feel as though shes not as attractive, but shes happy bout the way she feels.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i can fall in love after one month.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Kinda like suicide... normal to think about, but not to do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> move on and STALK someone else.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I don't want him as a boyfriend anymore.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> so how can I tell him?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Really though, they are just bad news.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I kinda like my guys thick.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just have fun or keep yourself busy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> How to check that I am madly  in love with her ...?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you can do alot of things.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Guys likes my butt and always whistling at my butt.. LUCKY ME, i guess!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Now the devils hell hounds are tracking his every step.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Then see what she says, and you'll have your answer
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> is he ruining his life or what?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Yep, some are WAY OUT THERE.hello.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I guess becuase they are loved, if not they wouldn't find it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it will bring him down and probably not want to have sex with you agian.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> see u ve decided to leav ur wife.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> because they are not happy missing somthing from their relationship
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But, still wants to have sex with you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I'd never pack my husband's bag!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well if you really love her, this will happen for sure.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> with kids its not so simple.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Most people don't believe in it until they fall, and fall hard.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Its not bad if you laugh at yourself.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Ha ha, have a delightful day.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Ask him if he'd like to go somewhere with you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and me im also mexican but not mixed.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i knew it is hard but is better for you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it just depend on how old you are
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> she's not interested, or maybe you came on too strong.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> don't do something u'll regret later!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> sorry I dont know where to find him...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> !And there are alot of other guys on this planet.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no, unless you feel you need to doubt that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> They don't do anything for me....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It's odd that someone so young is on here answering questions...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> That will cost you 3 points per answer :)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> y do it matter to u?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you want drinks there, make it BYOB.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> See...marriage is not fun and games.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> mayb thier hubbys are not good enough....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Find out if hes cheating on you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Have you two been hanging out with your parents?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> A woman wants an honest guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> 19, almost 20...  how old are you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> its is wet and so cool and better if its forbiden
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you can say it but whether you mean it or not is whats to be questioned...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he wouldn't think twice about NOT using a condom).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> He broke up with you because of what someone else said!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> first of all, are you sure that she really loves you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> sometimes yah...but you dont know if its real love
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> being good all the time is boring.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> step 1: do it 5 times a day.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Perhaps a little Narcissistic, maybe, but probably not gay...you just like the sight of, well, yourself.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if he doesn't, kick his butt.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> U are just jealous of those other people holding hands and making out because you can't get a guy!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> MY GRANDMOTHER TELLS THIS STORY BETTER!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I see him once in a while and I made the right decision.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but forgot to bring some for me .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and why did they not tell you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Unless the chick didn't care if I slept with other hoes.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> the more you think about here the more you want here.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ask the girl to go to the dance.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> find a girl that share the same intrest you do
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and that he has a tiny wiener.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i'm sorry dude, but that's disgusting.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> please leave her go on with your life.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I'VE HEARD OF FRIENDS THAT START GOING OUT AND FIND OUT THEY WERE EANT TO BE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> nope customer care took it off of the answers......bummer
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it's a way 2 show u that she doesnt want 2 attract any other guys..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i don't know...if i were you, i'd ask her whether or not she likes you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just be yourself and like the first guy said, a little money wont hurt anyone.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> do u think she should ask d guy??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yes, the butt is an important physical feature on a guy that makes him attractive.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> first kiss send my head spining for a few second.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If he says sure hye's not cheating.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Yes, so that I can do the same to her!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> nope.unless they actually SAID we're back on, then nope.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> dont make it look like you are attacking her weight she will just shut down and probably eat more.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> thats wrong to the person that said women commit because of money.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> any chance they'd like each other as well?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> be yourself and if they dont like you for that they dont deserve you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> YOUR DAUGHTER COMES FIRST IN ALL ASPECTS OF YOUR LIFE NO MATTER WHAT!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Then, he broke up with me after a few days!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> a person is there when u are happy and when u are sad.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Do i walk away or stay around????
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> chear up..things will get better,,trust me..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> May-b you become clingy after sex and it scares men away.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> do NOT fall totally in love with him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> wow thats really sad...were do you live???
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you dont mind being her backup then okay.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i wish u da best do watz right even though it might hurt.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Some girls like to please their man so nobody has to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> U are making issues with him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I think playing hard-to-get is your best bet!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and then again there are the homophpobics.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> )I want respect and I want him to be nice.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> anyone who 'doesn't get it' is brainwashed.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Stopped a kid from J walking / running accrost the street in the rain.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i think its alot  important .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> U need to ask him DIRECTLY, if he wants to spend the rest of his life with u.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> hey Be yourself if she dont like you then move on you are still young
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> um o let me think NOOOO.Get real this isnt a chat room
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you will find the one that is for you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Sex, u don't have to kiss, but u have to have sex.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> GET RID OF CAT,STEAM CLEAN CARPET,FURNITURE,BED LINEN, SPRAY FOR TICKS&FLEAS
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> So look at those girls in the eyes and dont look away
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> He believes she would not cheat on him but just hates this and it drives him crazy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it really depends on the situation...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> hugging him was probably not the best solution, lol.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And stop letting your hubby be such a slacker!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yes u could fall in love after 4 months trust me it happen to me
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> (throws bananna at the screen and scratches head)..lol..Just kidin.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> go and have ur breast treated and get them reduced and look sexy
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if they love each other they will live together
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> (In the future: don't ask such stupid questions.)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> My friend always teases for who I am!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> move on - time is essence
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just ask her if she ever have sex with anyone.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and she dont want other people to say anything.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> once by mistake i had proposed her and she had accepted.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> flirt and find out u never know to u try
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> congratulation to him and his bride, she is lucky :-)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Sounds like you not or you would be asking.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> perhaps... but obviously not enough feeling for her to leave his wife.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> All I know is i am with you there!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But I have my own opinions too :P
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Sex is serious and dirty, Making love is fun.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Say a prayer to help u guide the best possibilities.. people come and go in ur life.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> love is not rare dont worry and dont be the bit*ch ok?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if he says no he's cheating.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I was chatting wit a guy 2 hrs.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> not just honest but honorable........... ie not a cheater or player
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And he broke up with me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> tell him what you want, basicly, and lead him,
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> be honest with yourself and who you are.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and also the penis story as well.lol
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ur not on jerry springer now
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I know, it's easier said than done.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if u were to fall in love with a girl, would it be her: personality?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> do u mean how are u?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> The world is full of fucking guys ...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it's kind of weird for him probably.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If so why can't it make it?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Here's the answer that Life is great!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if he is doing it by choice that should be questioned and watched very closely
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I miss him.... if anyone out there know this guy please email me.........
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Ask her if she likes ya
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> DON'T GO TO YOURE BEST FRIENDS HOUSE WHEN HE'S AORUND, OR IF YOU DO MAKE SURE SHE'S AORUND TOO.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you like him then of course you should continue, why wouldn't you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't spend a lot of money.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and if you are not ready to becoming a mom, start prtecting yourself from getting pregnant...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> start from the day of your wedding.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Forget the text stuff just call him at home.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> One more thing- don't listen to these women.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yes you should, give him his walking papers.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Well, if she dumped you because you were just being you then.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> phone sex is like an alternative from doing the real thing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> marry her and go to the court.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just where ever you go give her the best of the best!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> - If your a Woman:  Dress up & act ladylike.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Im pretty or so guys tell me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> they are not good to have around babies they have dieases.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i think u should just write him a note
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> mayhaps you should travel to the uk and find this out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I'm married, trust me I know.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> No, Because it complicates things a lot.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> idk y r u askin me
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Well, if he makes you happy and you make him happy, then go for what you know!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Babe, HE IS THE ONE WHO DOESN'T LOVE YOU!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i think that ne younger then 14 or 15 is stupid.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> that is just how you know it jut comes to you and thn youll know!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If not, stay with your sister!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> First off, are you a guy, girl, or somewhere in between?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well just like me 2 years ago.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> to show their apreciation and to make it known that they think of you and they care for u.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> we are married but still she cant conceive...pls advise..
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I would tell him straight up,he probably won't care anyway.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it's all the inside that matters
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Perhaps she doesn't brag about him to her friends the way she used to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Okay, so he likes to flirt and he's good looking.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you like him, but you call him a creepy guy?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> who knows , and let the people alone
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> plz tell me  the possiability to be pregnant in this satuation
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> There's hot and awesome guys that weigh over 250!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Take a hint, she doesn't want you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> A MAN CAN WORK FROM SUN TO SUN, BUT A WOMENS JOB IS NEVER DONE!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Many men are, but all men are not.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You're a threat alright, you just don't know it yet.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i would have to agree with 16
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Of course.I would go.I do not have to be a muslim to attend such a wedding!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> oh God, try talking to him first.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Please, send me some more info if you need help ;-)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Sorry if I'm no help but we can talk about it if you want.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yes you can fall in love after 4 mönths , it could be .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> tell your friend to tell him that you like him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Since women feel they are mature for their age, why not?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well u cant take the baby back!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> IT'S A BEAUTIFUL THING TO STILL HAVE YOUR INNOCENCE DON'T EVER FEEL BAD ABOUT THAT.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he needs an incentive (although YOU should be the incentive, but some men are jerks like that).
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Another girl likes the guy that I do, and I feel like I don't stand a chance.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just like she did to you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Everything, a woman wants everything from a man!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I'm in Junior High and he is in highschool but he is a junior!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Or, you could always ask him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> a real man would not have to bribe you to kill your child.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and u just wanna be urself.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> when you're both naked and in bed together
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But it has to be up to you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> most of tha time i think about it and say well is it REALY my choice !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> WHAT'S THE OPPOSITE OF ABOVE ME?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> How about all the women that cheat.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Wow, alot of my friends' girlfriends ask me this same question.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But I agree that the guy you are asking about was just a dog!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I know it sucks now but you'll get over him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> whatever you do, just make sure you are not caught up in their fights.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Wow, what an ego you have.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Are you kidding me right now?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if u are in luv u will never feel boared....thats TRUE LUV my frind.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I don't want her to die.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just be careful when you do it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> now, would i put myself in danger for a friend or stranger...?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If i got that same kiss today i'd be very dissapointed.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and neither of us could think of anything better to do!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i want work to be over with today and forever!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> flirt with him/her and tell her you ove her/him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> otherwise its just something else that may lead to love you never know
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> do this either before he leaves or when you first see him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> We'd go for walks, & she'd whine.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no,becuase he doesn't really know her if he met her on the internet.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> either he loves you or he doesn't...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> He's already got a girlfriend it sounds like.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no its not boring to fall love.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> simply because u only put 90% of ur effort.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Instinctly, I'm going to say yes.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> A nice yard wedding worked for me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I dont think i have a chicken butt.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> then most likely you are stuck in the friend zone if that anymore... sorry.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> wait so he doesnt have a reason to hate you
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But smart peeps aren't a lil too smart.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Hell, the other Saturday morning, I had to pretend to be a shemale like 6 times!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I don't know, I think it is mixed.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> never mind, I tried it doesn't work.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Because if you go down that road and bail on him later, that would truly suck!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you aer under 18 and stell in school you do not want to have sex.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> or shell break it off to make a move.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> give her one in front of everybody and see what she does
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he is getting married to a women right?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> maybe one day they will be conviced.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Know anyone who can make a cake...there you go!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> So should I tell my man that I don't like being around him?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> why did you leave home the first time?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no,just leave him like a dog and he'll know how good you are!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I don't like seeing her ribs though, sorry supermodels.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> do not know, except that i am not on the list.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> cause most guys are laing dogs
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Women can be friends, but men can't....................
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> when she not asking you for any, any more!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> At least that way I'd get into her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Or like what you did for class....?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> its exciting, especially when you have the butterflies in your stomach!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> 2 months if you want to go in the poor house.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> That said, just because everyone is dating and you aren't doesn't mean that there is anything wrong with you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> LOL is short for LAUGHING OUT LOUD.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> the more that you keep giving him the more he is gonna take.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ?i think infatuation is only for months...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> depend on the girl if she likes your buutt she will take care of it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If I wanted it, I wouldnt only want it once.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> different men like different things...i know guys that like big girls (I also know some that don't).

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I'm 25....are you serious about your age????????
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you are not her type and i believe she is not also your type.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't let him use you ...and by that I mean - Think about your self.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> are they sick or wonderful.plz elaborate and answer me
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> because the boys get gelles that you like hin not me

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you know any, please recommend me,  Thanks
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no offense to any good men out there
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> My mom's boyfriend and I always argue.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> were not getting any younger, that is the adveture in life.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I've been hanging out with this really hott guy and we are getting closer and closer every day.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> STAND ON A CHAIR OR WALK ON STILTS!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if u like sports play vball or bball or whatever!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> of his life, and he would never cheat on me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> im sorry if i got the point wrong.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Or if you're too shy, get involved in things she likes, even if you hate it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> she's realised what shes thrown away, and can see how happy you are.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> start commenting him on his looks!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> The dress, and brides maids dresses might take you a month alone LOL
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> maybe the same way you told us!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you daughter is acting stupid and you should tell her so,  then shut up.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> He didn't think about u at all.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> No they will not go to heaven.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> all depends on so many factors, such as mood...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I'm a boy, wanna go out with me?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Good luck and I hope he catches on and asks you out!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Let things go as they are going.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you need to sign another one every day with each other.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and the only reason i did that is because i didnt want to feel lonely.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I have a friend who shops there for that reason!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> (think about what that makes you look like to his friends?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Do a good deed every day!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> your damb right you did the right thing!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> haven't done that but i mean..  think i'd either start laughing or get way too distracted
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I wouldn't want my wife to have a sexual affair.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you don't need all girls to like you--just one.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> No matter what stand up for your self.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> know a lot of girls here in the philippines that met someone online and got married.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if he is joking about liking you, then forget him!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> We have 3 children under 5, so it's not like I can play with him for very long.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> my guy has an awesome butt because he works out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> So looking at other women, flirting with other women isn't cool.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ask from ur sister she give sutiable answer to u
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> The same problem is with me
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Not necessary but it helps a lot!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If your over him it shows.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i think you need to talk to yer cousin.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I think it would be cool.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Women are different, just like men are.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I know a lot of decent guys.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> a girl that has a sluty mind set but isnt one u know
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> probably so couldn't stay away from eachother long!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it kinda depends though when you are older
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you say ur sexy and stylish?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you are living in a fantasy
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Lot thoughts coming while going to bed.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> DOn't marry that girl at all, she is using you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> okay, most of the girls in your campus hate him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> People freaked out about that, but I'm glad I married him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> In my Daddy's world, my Mama was.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Dont EVER EVER fall for that garbage.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> There are some great looking young 50 year old men; but why not look for younger men!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> THE GIRL YOU LIKE is going to be alone and she says that sucks.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> THEN.....HE TRIED TO KILL HIMSELF AND MY STUPID BUTT WENT TO SEE HIM IN THE HOSPITAL.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> hook/ kiss up with the guy in front of that girl.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> 1) If you date trash, you'll marry trash.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but this really depends on her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> A girl can be pretty no matter what size she is.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> cos one way or another shes GONNA find out if we got to bed together!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> then if he still wants to be friends only.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> she a player all she wants is a boy toy
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Then  you can do whatever you like
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Sometimez even a smart gurl could go for a guy who isn't as smart as her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You can't do what you are asking.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Because most of guys are nothing but lying cheating dogs!!!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> do you chat in yahoo chat rooms?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> be yourself, be confident, and be honest... if it's not meant to be then so be it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> that's the best way to find out.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and i say this in the friendliest way that i can.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Falling in love (really in love) is just magical... until reality hits you in the head :-)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> There no better way than tell him frankly, but tendly, sweetly ...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> 30 is pretty young to be gaining a lot of weight.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I'm male, so it must be sex...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he not into toys or anything freaky.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> When he starts seeing someone else
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> So what should I do for her!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Hi proud2blatina29, It's not just for lovers.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> When your really in love u would do anything and everything 4 that person!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well it depends on if you have feelings for her still.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> DONT PRETEND TO ACT LIKE SOMETHING ELSE!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> nobody will give you a positive responce
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just put it out there casually.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> love is caring for someone, or something that you would not forget.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> A song that's stuck in my head.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Let him know how u truly feel and if he still can't find the time just blow him off.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but its really hard to avoid!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Turn ons: Hairy chest and chin.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if i didnt have kids i would die for the one i love.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> He's such a sweet heart but I tell ya, I've gotta question his thinking skills sometimes..lol.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> when u'll dive in her mind u'll know everything.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> maybe, 90% she does and 10% she doesnt.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Notiing wrong with this, does he join in also, i'd say if it's 3 together thats cool, otherewise no
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> what kind of girlfriend is she?..ur trying to fix the trust, how?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i know quitting the school team was a good decision.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> or you really love that person, me?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I HOPE ALL WORKS WHETHER IT IS FINDING YOUR LOVED ONE OR FINDING A NEW LOVED ONE.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if u dont trust him then how can he loves u or u love him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> there is still hope for these young girls
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yeah your just confused and don't know who you want right now
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Sorry but my magic 8 Ball says NO
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> However, whenever I send him a message he just ignores me!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> love is not scary-if it scary =IT NOT LOVE You just haven't met the MrRight yet so GOOD LUCK
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> NO i DON'T THINK THAT IT'S WEIRD OR GEEKY!!

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> my friend likes this guy and he said he would like to get to know her better.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And you don’t need special shoes !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> What did he say 'oh hang on, I don't love you, I was mistaken.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I don't think so...  Behave yourself...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If they love you they will accept you no matter what!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> u surely did the right thing!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> walk up to her and ask,  I like you alot, Do you like me?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Why can´t you just do it?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But I guess you could always try it, is it worth it to you??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if killing himself is what it's going to take for him to get over this then so be it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> keep quiet why hurt his feelings
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if u cant do that then maybe u can email him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Iam humbly stating....I HAVE ALL THE ABOVE qualities...hahaha!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> tell him straight up it's better to hurt the person now than later
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But it does not do anything with you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he REALLY haz a BIG CRUSH on you!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> she likes to dye her hair different colors
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I think females do it too.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Do married woman still givee head?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I just had a vision... you'll get married as soon as you decide to do so!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Some guys are just like that.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you have to want to let go and move on or you won't be able to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Act yourself; just keep your tongue in your mouth and knees together!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no but that would be funny because I am 6 foot 2in.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no matter how long it will take to let them go.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if he still doesnt, try to just be his friend.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> does he care about things relates to your not?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Guys are hunters like dogs that like the hunt but the chase is really what they are after...so run...run...run
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> He just wants you to do this so he will feel comfortable messing around as well!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i wear glasses and i have had boyfriends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> women liking women is very common and some grow to like it more others let if fade over time.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I don't, but Homer Simpson is HOT!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I know I already said that.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Point out where you want your man to put it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> See what gets you more heated up.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You didnot tell your age ,any way ask him to marry you first then think about kids
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> When she slacks off sleeping with you !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> they r so beautiful and lovely
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> god is happy when 2 people love each other- regardless of their sex.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if she's fine w/her apperance, u shld support her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> unless I found out I didn't really want it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if I knew who she was i could help.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> he did it one time he do it again????????????
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> somebody is there for ur good and for ur bad moments.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> What should I expect from my BF if I go??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Not even free lunch or fireworks.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if u dont u'll never have contact with him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Really good looking men tend to be vain.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> at the maximum 3to5 years older than you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Both is nice...Just depending on what kinda Mood/or Day we are all having =)...

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you dont use it, you lose it
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Dude, I dunno how you feel about that, but umm... Yuck.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Save your heartbreak, find a nice guy.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i did quit and joined a rec team and i had so much more fun.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If he is married you should not even be friends.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if she asks me and I don't know the answer.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and YES ive got lots of chanceS!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well, i feel you on this one, cuz i'm goin thru the same thing right now.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just hang in there just enough so he doesn't think you're a bimbo.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if she wants to play mind games its time to move on to the next luv interest
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> are you hearing your self out?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I guess it depends.... have you ever committed a felony?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> YEAH, BUT I HAVEN'T MET THE RIGHT PERSON WHICH I WOULD DIE FOR YET.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> A girl should like you for who you are and nothing else!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> so why shouldn't it be normal to do it on the phone!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you can but do u really mean it??!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Q3) B - I married a handsome mean guy and I divorced him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> obesty is the .2. killer in young people now.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> So, he says you don't truly love him because you only called him twice??
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just stand firm and tell him it's over.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> pity doesn,t get you into these panties.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> My boyfriend farts and belches like a government mule!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> my friend told me that she really loves me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I DON`T , LIFE IS SERIOUS, LIVE IT,YOU MIGHT ENJOY
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Then go and hang out with them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you really love him ...DO IT !
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Maybe not for anything else but for the thrill of it!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> OUR FAMILY HATED THE FACT THAT IT WAS A INTERRAISAL RELASIONSIP MY FATHER AND HIS GRANDMOTHER LOST IT .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but before all that go to a flower shop an surprise her with flowers
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> don't try that , plz your life will be ended
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just latch on to his di ck and you will instantly own him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> hope i was of some help.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no i don't care about my boyfriend's.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> seducing a woman it's a great feeling, an achievment.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I personally dont really focus on a guys butt.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You dont...you just go on with life pretending you do
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> B/c then when one hurts u, o well u hav another to fall bac on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't be afraid to tell him what you want!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Guys like a little (not alot) mystery in a girl.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> without sex, there's one less evidence that two pple like each other.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If it's DURING sex she's NOT a virgin!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> the problem is, i dont know if she likes me.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if he loves you, he'd care even it's just a petty things.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> First of all, the guy didn't do it TO you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and he can not notice that.........!!!!!!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Not really, do you still love him?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> this is how my wife keeps my ATTENTION!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Tell her to get a life
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> What can i do with her for fun after school?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> the world is going to end just becuase you ask stupid questions like this one.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> p.s...not criticizing or labelling you at all!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't text and ask, that's lame!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> my man loves me and i hope ur man loves u
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it would look funny, but as long as u 2 luv each other.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> maybe he just doesn't feel like talking.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if its against your religion, then sry, i dont know wut to tell you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i dont know who you meet.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't make yourself sound so disgusting....and cheap...  Married men are off limits...

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If it's a chess cake, much better !!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Probably not, but again, I don't think I would want him to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> get him drunk and take off your clothes!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> to you what can a woman do say or look like in order to be sexy
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> some can't live without it and others can.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it is not a bad thing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING IN THE WATER!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> doesnt really matter bout his height, its bout how much u guys r in love
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> - If you are a Man:  Act like a real gentleman.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> As far as the love thing i dont know.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it was about 10years ago but they still really love each other.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Sometimes it really sucks, but it'll be when its meant to be.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Boys want to become men and men want women.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> which of course really pissed my off.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well first just huge him then look into his eyes and say i love you then say his name.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> YOUR RIGHTS ARE TO DATE AND GO ON!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you are 25 and he's 34, then thats not so bad.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no one knows this girls intentions if she really loves him she will wait.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yeah, me v6 and jj all go to his school.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well, just try to observe his action.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Men like younger women and I am not going for a woman my age.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Perhaps his wife doesn't seduce him the way she used to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> make her realise that she is too important for u and that u are the man of her dreams
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> try to smile before you look away so you don't make the girl think you think shes ugly :)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Im smart but I dont think Im smart enough for him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> that jus means u like to see ur self
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I hate to say it, but its going to get worse once you're married.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But if not then he is sooooo not worth it....

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> At least i would.Oh and its cost free!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ?/ Why men are stronger ant tougher and more honest and resposible, and hardworking?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I go out of my way for a married man.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I see her terribly upset - what can we do?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But I don't have alot of money for fancy clothes, flowers,lots of food, & all the other wedding stuff.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I speak idiot, gruntinees and jabberwocky..maybe I can help PM me
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> whats so hard to understand?...the guy just wanted to get into your pants

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Not accusingly, but just a nice conversation?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I THINK ITS A GOOD THING.... TO TRY THE MILK BEFORE YOU BUY THE COW .....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> He tried to love someone romantically (me) but he just can't!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Want to come see my HARD DRIVE?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> why would he go to jail?

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you are still a kid wait
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you should make the first move

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it is ok to like him even though others do not.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> why do men lie so much?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> tell them you dont want to have sex
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> it is better to 'lets quit'
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You shouldn't second guess what you guys do if both of you are cool with it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> to th extent of giving my soul away...but if its oneside love i wont do anythng!!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if only i knew the answer...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> play with his lil buddy while hes playing
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Admittly we are simple creature while some men and women are just creeps.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> there is no way to know
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yes you can but it might not be love ,probably a strong emotion
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I had ONE date with this guy who seemed so nice on the phone.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> go upto him n speak out yr doubts
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> sure as long as you like him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I still know a girl who's looking for Mr.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> either way it's going to be painful.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> don't be dumb and stupid, be average in intelligence.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> rent everything and have one of your family members take pictures and recordings.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Because trust me: later in life you will regret it!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But i think 15 16 is a pretty good age.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> or im just scared or shy!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Think of the &$%# he would get if he was dating a girl in Jr. High.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It might be hard, but try to act like you don't want it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Love isn't bad...you should try it...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Don't just hand it to her.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no, so long as you're both adults.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Ask for her phone number... if she does not give it - then SHE DOES NOT LIKE YOU.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> tell him that you love him&#92;her in any way.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If he doesn't answer directly, or does the smoke and mirrors thing.... U know what u need to do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> WELL ALL DEPENDS ON HOW LONG YOU BEEN WITH HER .
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If she blows you off, forget it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Well, if he only kind of likes her then he shouldn't get too mad.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You guys need a marriage counsellor or a bigger bed.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> hang-outs clubs, groups....good luck and have fun.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Spend LOTS of time with your girlfriends - hang out  -have fun - let yourself be around other guys.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> did you catch him or did he volunteer the info.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> go out with your mates and have a great time!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But oops.. Now I really love my wife very much.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> ... Oh yeah, a great sense of humor, good-natured and self-confidence.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Holy Grail my friend, Wish I knew.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> is having sex with your boyfriend something normal?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but i've learned that if a guy really likes you, he'll show it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Ok been there done that sweetie.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i have too much to live for.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> where do i go for help?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I THINK YOU SHOULD TELL HIM THAT YOU HAVE TO RESPECT YOUR BEST FRIEND AND HE SHOULD RESPECT YOU.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> take him to s good bar were you can play darts and pool
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> happy u r. mature and attractive enough.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> No contact whatsoever just a simple crush or do i have to get over it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Either that or just flirt a little bit.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> of course cause i wouldn't be able to live with her death
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Dont hurt her... good luck  just remember there are lots of men out there.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> depends on choice, but i like dog style too much..ok
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> what happens if the relationship does'nt work out?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You two should be boinking like rabbits.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> nah..you girls are just too paranoid in everything
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> maybe d love wasnt really that much when u got married.. u just thought it was!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> then you can do these things together!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Give me your input because I HATE VALENTINE'S DAY.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just be who you are and enjoy whatever it is you like.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no only if you want your friend to watch too
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> we have phone sex everyday, never get tired of it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  but it can make it alot worse!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> treat him just like you would a good friend you have not seen in a long time.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If you are really her friend you won't even consider it!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I almost at the point where i no longer even care to give it a shot.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> nope but if your in love sex is a totaly differant experiance.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> losers dont usualy like other losers.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yea i used to do it all the time
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> That's a very good question....  Not one thing i could thing of...
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you guys dont have sex, then i dont see a problem.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> would you like it if your future husband cheated on you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Hey guy, I've seen you on a CD, havent I, and I like famous singers!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If he loves her why not?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Sweety, why can't you just ask her out?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Get ideas off of the knot website.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> think about it in my opion dump this fellow?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> other than that, there should be no reason why you shouldn't go out with him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Kick his ass and get rid of him.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Do you really want to marry a guy in a trial for 2 attempted murders???
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> then you will no her if or when your feelings change.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just brief your story and hope i can help u in many ways.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if all he wanted was to make-out with u, he didnt really love u!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i know my ex did me the same way.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> For the long tertm: yes For the short: no
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> yeah it depends on how long you've been chatting.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> no, he should not get married to her at this time.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> My girlfriend is crazy about this butt thing.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> dont be so posesive, let him free, guys likes freedom
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Heck no, I'm a guy, and I wouldn't care if she masturbated infront of me, I would enjoy it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Maybe you are into the bad boys???
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Men dont like women to tell them what they need to do.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Whana come sit in my cock pit!!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i personally think it's kinda weird.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> she cant stop you from seeing your little man.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> even on silent he can see the missed calls.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Run like hell and never look back.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if she's shy than probably she reaallyyy likes you.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> And with protection u can start anytime.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Just keep going till you hit the next Level i.e Level 4
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> one was wolf the other a very large lab
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Some men do and some men don't....
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> actually this sounds weird but try watching both kinds of porn One gay, one straight.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If the guy treats you great, who cares what his butt is like.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I praised my god for got her as my wife.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> U can tell him anytime.He'll probably do that if he isn't gay
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I didn't believe till I saw her eyes.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> maybe shes playinhg hard to get or she really likes u n dousnt admit it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Hey, Honey...do you wanna talk about what's going on?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and why do the girls there have facial hair?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> I guess things can get lost but memories... well is little harder to  get rid of them ;)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> and definitely consider asking ur older sis again.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Surprise her with it and give her little gifts during the dinner!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Yeah right he knows he dont know me!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> In my sweetie's eyes, I am.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if you both can wait, then it's worth it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i used to be like that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You'll never get any peace if you keep him around
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> forget all about him, don't go out of your way to make him think your over him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> But I hope not, I have enough trouble with gays making googley eyes at me on earth.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It means she probably wouldn't have left you if you would have chilled out back then.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> mabie you married the wrong guy ?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> well, yes, but I hope I never have to.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Woman want it more and the men are saying no.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You don't want to spend the rest of your life wondering what if.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> you can go somewhere else with your bf when you both have time.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> SEX IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS A MAN CAN DO IN LIFE AND IT FEELS GREATTTT
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> because if u knew that, u might try to do or be that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> what the hell should i do?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> If ya are waiting for Prince Charming to come and find you.. 2 words.. OLD MAID!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Keep your boyfriend, but find a LOVER!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Lovin up with some skeezer tramp.

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> get rid of anything having to do with him
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> what was this all about, i'm curious now?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You know what you want, don't you?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> It's SIMPLE.... just don't do it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> nope are u a guy or girl?

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> tell him to leave her alone.he should be looking for another one.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> if we want money you just want sex not love.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> she's not even in college yet, and u want 2 have a serious relationship?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> HOW COOL AND we should THANK HIM EACH DAY FOR WONDERFUL FEELINGS OF SEX!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Okay, if you want it to be special, DON'T buy her etible panties!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> LAST recourse, CLING and PRAY TO JEHOVAH GOD and to HIS SON JESUS CHRIST!
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> do they really love you or do they just say it.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> i think not, unless your trying to commit suicide?
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> GREAT KISSER BUT GREAT SEX IS NICE TOO:)
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> MY FRIEND HAD NO IDEA HOW SHE RUINED ME.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> how else could you be but straight forward?

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> get a younger guy for god's sake.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> You see her looks and thats it!

<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> :)  Seriously though, the best way is just to tell them.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> just ask if you can't tell.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> tell your parents u love them and move on.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> god doesn't care, love is love.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> boys just want sincere and caring females who can accomodate them in life and nothing else
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> because they feel like they are not needed by there husbands
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> always listen to your gut feeling.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Open it and ask her just like ya did here.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> but i am unsure of that.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Think, what's her favorite resturaunt...cofee shop...vineard...etc.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> none of the above,ask me about big boys or small boys,and i will tell you.lol
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> (I don't want to be mean) but it sounds like he may have some cheating issues.
<NbChars_105> <LevSim_60> Yeah I F****N hate this day too!!
